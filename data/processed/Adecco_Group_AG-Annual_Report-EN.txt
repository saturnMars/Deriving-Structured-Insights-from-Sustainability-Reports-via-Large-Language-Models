OUR PURPOSE. 
The Adecco Group is the world’s leading talent solutions and advisory company, driven by a powerful purpose – to make the future work for everyone. We are building on our unique 360° ecosystem of talent solutions and advisory to bring to life our vision of enabling sustainable and lifelong employability for individuals and empowering organisations to optimise their workforces.
To move us ever closer to this goal, in 2021, we began putting in place key elements of our Future@Work strategy, including the creation of our three Global Business Units and strategic advancement of the underlying enablers. Delivery of our strategy will enable the Adecco Group to make a positive impact on the lives of even more people, while we continue to support the sustainable growth of our clients and contribute to more prosperous, inclusive societies at large.

THE YEAR IN REVIEW — 2021 HIGHLIGHTS. 
Implementing the Future@Work strategy while performing in uncertain times 1 EBITA is a non-US GAAP measure and refers to operating income before amortisation and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets. 2 Cash conversion is a non-US GAAP measure and is calculated as free cash flow before interest and tax paid divided by EBITA excluding one-offs. Free cash flow is a non-US GAAP measure and is calculated as cash flows from operating activities less capital expenditures. 3 For 2021, as proposed by the Board of Directors. CHF 1.25 (50%) from reserves not subject to withholding tax. 4 Net debt to EBITDA is a non-US GAAP measure and is calculated as net debt at period end divided by the last four quarters, EBITA excluding one-offs plus depreciation. Net debt is a non-US GAAP measure and comprises short-term and long-term debt less cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. The lower net debt level is mainly a result of the funding secured in September 2021 for the acquisition of AKKA Technologies in 2022. 5 Total taxes paid is the aggregate total of income taxes paid, sales taxes paid, and employer payroll and social security taxes paid. 6 Peakon eNPS® – the Workday Peakon Employee Voice survey the Group uses to gather employee feedback on their experience at work.

At the same time, the Group delivered a resilient business performance as it adapted to the new world of work, providing innovative solutions that enabled clients, associates, candidates and the wider economies where it operates, to better navigate within this new environment.

DEAR ADECCO GROUP STAKEHOLDERS. 
Fundamental changes to the world of work have characterised the past two years. During 2021, together with our families, many of us witnessed and experienced further changes in our work and how we live. Some of these changes resulted directly from the effects of the continuing Covid-19 crisis, while others were generated by the impact of accelerating megatrends across the world.
Against this backdrop, the Adecco Group continued to adapt the way we worked, focusing on business continuity and building resilience across the Company. This enabled us to maintain high levels of service to our clients, associates and candidates, as well as supporting them to adjust to the upcoming trends of the future of work. This is testament to the dedication of our more than 32,000 employees in 60 countries and we sincerely thank them for their commitment.
At the beginning of what proved to be a challenging 2021, we also embarked on our Future@Work strategy implementation by setting the agenda for the business for the coming three to five years.
Financial performance. 
The Adecco Group delivered a solid performance in 2021, despite the continuing public health crisis linked to Covid-19. Revenues, gross margin and EBITA margin all improved when compared to the previous year, driven by the delivery of the strategy and the economic recovery. Meanwhile, investments in the digitalisation and transformation of the Group continued.
Revenues increased by 7% on a reported basis, and were up 9% organically, driven by a broad-based recovery across client industries.
The EBITA margin excluding one-offs was 4.6%, up 100 bps, with the gross margin expansion partly offset by the investments in digital transformation and in sales capacity to capture the growing demand as economies recovered.
On the other hand, we have identified some areas of underperformance, particularly in the United States, which we are addressing.
Building resilience. 
Jean-Christophe Deslarzes Chair of the Board (right)
Alain Dehaze Chief Executive Officer. 
Megatrends and the Covid-19 crisis continue to impact the world of work. 
The advancement of the gig and platform economy; geopolitical and economic uncertainty; the continued growth of the use of big data, digital applications, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning; changes in the demographic mix and skills imbalances are some of the megatrends that continue to drive change in the world of work. Some of these have been exacerbated or accelerated by the crisis and continue to influence global, national and local economies. Businesses – ranging from multi-national corporations, small and medium-size enterprises, to the ownermanaged business – as well as individuals are challenged to remain flexible and continuously adapt.
Supply chain dislocations certainly shook confidence in some sectors, even as the economic recovery gained momentum, with surprising speed in some regions. This had a knock-on effect on the labour market which, in 2021, was especially dynamic. It was characterised by acute scarcity of workers in some sectors, like transport and logistics, health and social care as the fourth Covid-19 wave added further challenges and employees were re-evaluating their work environments and prospects.
During these turbulent times, we at the Adecco Group have made it our mission to support our stakeholders by being even more resilient, innovative, and responsive. Our Future@Work strategy and corresponding organisational transformation are positioning the Group as the partner of choice to clients as the only company in the sector that can offer a truly differentiated set of solutions across all their HR-related needs and thus help them navigate these all-embracing megatrends. In turn, these partnerships enable the Group to attract higher value-added, higher margin work in higher growth sectors.
Our 360° ecosystem, which brings together the complementary expertise and capabilities of the three Global Business Units (GBUs), delivers these holistic solutions to help individuals develop their careers and clients transform their workforce. We do this by providing the best mix of filling permanent and flexible vacancies at scale, recruitment, outsourcing, up-skilling and re-skilling – combined with transition coaching. We facilitate digital matching of job seekers to vacancies and in the technology and engineering sectors, we additionally supply talent, technology and engineering research and development services, including consulting, across all stages of Smart Industry implementation.

COMPANY REPORT. 
Key insights into global workforce trends. 
At the Adecco Group, we constantly keep our finger on the pulse so we can predict and stay ahead of the changes in the labour market. Our updated research, “Resetting Normal 2021”, surveyed nearly 15,000 knowledge workers across 25 countries and gave clear insights into working practices, behaviours and attitudes towards work. It had a particular focus on hybrid and remote working, productivity, mental health and leadership. Here are the key insights:
First, hybrid work is here to stay. But one person’s ideal proportion of office and remote working will not suit another. How that mix of working is executed requires considerable thought and flexibility across the business and on an individual basis. Special focus must be paid to re-integrating returning parents back into the workforce.
Second, workers want to be measured by results and not on hours input. Leaders must recognise this and adapt their success criteria and the way they manage remote or hybrid teams. Workers on the whole don’t give their leaders a good score for their performance or empathy in 2021, and these leadership skills and knowledge gaps must be closed. Our Group has constantly evolved new ways of leading and our leadership development and coaching solutions through LHH (Talent Solutions), and in particular Ezra, are attracting increasing interest.
And finally, deteriorating mental health is a major issue, which can be tied both to the leadership deficit, and to young leaders themselves experiencing burnout, as well as the blurring of home and work life when working remotely.
The results of Resetting Normal are a call to action for companies to proactively manage the new world of work and to focus on the key issues. The rewards for adopting the right approach – in terms of attraction, retention and productivity – are huge. The penalties of a weak or reactive approach include loss of key staff resulting in business disruption, together with excessive and avoidable hiring and onboarding costs.
Future@Work – laying firm foundations. 
During 2021, we made considerable progress in deploying key elements of our Future@Work strategy implementation, which we launched at the start of the year. At the same time, we established three Global Business Units (GBUs), each with their own business and market strategy, while also being integral parts of the overall Group transformation efforts.
As we touched on before, the combined capabilities, domain knowledge and expertise from each of the Global Business Units also contribute to the Adecco Group’s 360° ecosystem – addressing client needs from all angles – and developing solutions across a range of HR services to meet specific needs in a tailored way. Three key enablers: digitisation, differentiation and customer experience, support our development across the Global Business Units and in Group-supported sales and marketing efforts as we refine and focus our market presence.
A cornerstone of the Future@Work strategy has been the intention to grow and build-out our capability in higher value-added solutions in higher margin segments – both organically and through acquisition – across the full HR services, for the benefit of our clients, candidates and associates globally.
In the middle of the year, we initiated the largest transaction since the formation of the Adecco Group in 1996. In a major acceleration of our Future@Work strategy, we announced the proposed acquisition of AKKA Technologies, a world leader in engineering, research and development in the Smart Industry sector. In mid-September, we were able to announce 15,000 Surveyed nearly 15,000 knowledge-workers across 25 countries. 
Three key outputs: 1. Hybrid is here to stay 2. Workers want to be measured by results and not on hours input 3. Deteriorating mental health is a major issue.

the completion of a balanced financing package in advance of the expected closing of the deal in early 2022. This acquisition is both strategically and financially compelling and is clear evidence of our stated Future@Work ambition to form a global powerhouse in Smart Industry. The combined business of our Global Business Unit Modis and AKKA will do just that.
In August, work started to implement plans to simplify the market presence of the multiple brands that form our Talent Solutions Global Business Unit, under one combined global LHH brand. Pilot projects to test the strength of the new brand show that stakeholders will quickly recognise LHH as a leader in its field and the brand will gain rapid recognition for the quality and breadth of its HR services and solutions. At the same time, we announced the acquisition of BPI Group in France which enables LHH to extend its leading market position and broaden its advisory offering.
In September, the Group announced the acquisition of QAPA, the number two provider of fully digital workforce solutions in France. QAPA, which joins the Adecco Global Business Unit, deploys the latest digital technologies, particularly artificial intelligence and cloud architecture, to provide fast, flexible, and reliable candidate sourcing, matching, and back-office processing at a low cost and 100% online, remotely and automatically, in real time.
All these acquisitions are in full alignment with our Future@Work strategy and represent major proof points of our intention to truly differentiate and to invest in faster growth, higher margin sectors.
Our strong, continued purpose. 
What unites and drives our efforts is our powerful purpose of making the future work for everyone. Our unrelenting focus on enabling the sustainable and lifelong employability of individuals and supporting clients with their workforce-related needs has rarely been more important than now, as many people are still grappling with the impact of the Covid-19 crisis on their livelihoods while others are re-evaluating what they want to do with their work lives. Our vision is of a world in which everyone has the opportunity to access and remain in employment – regardless of where they started, what has happened to them or where they are right now.
To respond to these needs, in 2021 we launched Adecco Inclusion, a new service line dedicated to scaling-up our existing offerings, focused on enabling underrepresented communities to access the labour market. In France, we committed to increasing the Adecco Inclusion Network by 50% to 150 agencies and thereby double the people supported from 7,500 to 15,000 per year. In Italy, we launched a new Diversity & Inclusion hub, a team of specialised consultants entirely dedicated to placing candidates belonging to protected categories. In the US, we partnered with OneTen, a coalition of leading CEOs and organisations committed to up-skilling, hiring and advancing one million Black individuals into jobs over the next decade.
Inclusion and environment +50% increase in the Adecco Inclusion Network across 150 agencies 10,000 refugees were assigned to clients last year 50% by 2030 carbon footprint reduction target. 
Jean-Christophe Deslarzes Chair of the Board of Directors. 
Alain Dehaze Chief Executive Officer. 
In light of the crisis in Afghanistan we redoubled our existing efforts to integrate more refugees in the labour market. In Germany for example 10,000 refugees were provided employment opportunities within client organisations last year. In France we co-founded the initiative “Refugees are Talents” as well as committed to mentoring 100 refugee women. In the UK, General Assembly announced a new partnership with Breaking Barriers, focused on enhancing career opportunities for individuals from refugee backgrounds through targeted up-skilling and re-skilling in key digital and technology disciplines.
Our commitment to shared value creation and doing business responsibly is an integral part of our Future@Work strategy. It is further embodied in our continued commitment to the UN Global Compact’s universally accepted and relevant-as-ever principles on human and labour rights, the environment and anti-corruption, as expressed in this report and on our website.
Looking to the future. 
During 2022 we will build on the foundations we have established as we continue to roll out the key elements of our Future@Work strategy. On the operational front, our focus will be to accelerate our growth, improve our performance particularly in the United States, integrate AKKA and Modis and continue to focus on the implementation and adoption of digital systems and processes to support growth and efficiency.
During 2021, we distributed EUR 365million in dividend payments, and this year, in line with our continuing commitment to delivering a sustainable dividend, we propose to maintain that dividend at CHF2.50 per share.
Through our Global Business Units, the Group is uniquely positioned – even more so thanks to the AKKA & Modis combination – to create significant value.
Our Adecco Group 360° ecosystem brings together a unique and differentiated capability as we continue to meet customer demands and expectations for a more tailored, holistic and wide-ranging suite of human resources solutions, as well as technology and digital engineering services.
We would like to once again extend our deepest thanks to all our colleagues and leaders around the world for their continuing commitment and resilience and we look forward to working together to deliver our Future@Work strategy.

OUR SUSTAINABILITY GOALS 10 Annual Report 2021


Gig and platform economy. 
Individuals from across the skills spectrum are increasingly working a portfolio of jobs or gigs, rather than traditional, full-time jobs. For some this is a choice based on lifestyle exposure to a broad range of assignments and workplaces to accelerate their careers. For others it is a necessity.
Online platforms can help to effectively match worker needs with employer demands, but the platform economy can also pose risks of exploitation and exclusion. And, as the demand for flexibility among workers and companies grows, society needs to update its social protection systems accordingly.
Geopolitical and economic uncertainty. 
The influences of globalisation, nationalism, economic openness and social rights can profoundly impact the environment in which the Adecco Group and our clients operate. Uncertainty fuels the need for companies to flexibly respond to economic and seasonal cycles and increases the need for a data-driven radar that anticipates future developments. At the same time, candidates and associates seek more security and flexibility. Businesses need more and more agility and resilience to stay ahead, and flexible talent solutions are becoming an important source of competitive advantage.
Human-centricity. 
With unemployment rising due to the Covid-19 pandemic, there is an ever-increasing need to up- and re-skill workers to address the existing skills shortages, create a truly inclusive workforce, and ensure that no one is left behind.
More than one billion jobs, or about a third of jobs worldwide, will be transformed by technology over the next ten years, according to one OECD estimate. It is important to ensure that people in shrinking industries are re-skilled to meet increasing talent demands. This means taking a more personalised approach to skilling and talent development.
Digitalisation. 
The Covid-19 crisis has accelerated the importance of digital transformation for business continuity. Companies see the necessity of both infrastructure investments and the adoption of a truly digital mindset. This is not just about repetitive tasks increasingly being performed by machines. It frees workers to focus on higher value-added activities and nowhere more so than in the HR services industry.
Going forward, we see the combination of automation and flexible HR solutions as the next key driver of productivity for our clients.
GLOBAL MEGATRENDS SHAPING THE WORLD OF WORK. 
Outsourcing, Consulting & Other Services. 
We also offer a full spectrum of complementary HR solutions, including: Outsourcing – staffing and managing the entirety of a labour-intensive activity, such as warehouse logistics or IT support; Consulting – providing technical experts for project-related work; Managed Service Programmes (MSPs) – managing all parts of the flexible workforce at organisations using a large number of contingent workers; and Recruitment Process Outsourcing (RPO) – handling the entire hiring process for employers recruiting large numbers of permanent employees.
Training, Up-skilling & Re-skilling. 
We offer training, up-skilling and re-skilling both as standalone services and in combination with other solutions, such as placements or as part of a broader workforce transformation offering. Adecco is a leading provider of work-based training. Our General Assembly brand is a leader in up-skilling and re-skilling in high-demand digital skills, while our Modis Tech Academy offers candidates the opportunity to upskill in technology and digital-engineering-related fields to increase their employability and to create a supply of in-demand candidates for our clients.

Our strategy. 
The Adecco Group’s Future@Work strategy was launched at the end of 2020 and implementation began in 2021.
It consists of three core elements: 1 The establishment of a brand-driven business with the Global Business Units, Adecco, LHH (Talent Solutions) and Modis.
2 Three Global Business Units, each with their own bold vision, contribute to – and benefit from – the Group’s tailored 360° ecosystem offerings.
3 A transformation programme to optimise efficiencies and innovation across the businesses and Group, underpinned by a focus on three enablers: superior customer service, differentiated portfolio offering and a digitally optimised business model.
Megatrends that impact our business. 
External trends are impacting our business and our customers – all of whom are facing fundamental change in the world of work.
Political and economic uncertainty, digitisation, personalisation of services and the rise of the gig and platform economy mean people are forced to rethink their attitudes towards work and are more likely to consider temporary or freelance opportunities. Businesses have to be more agile, flexible and responsive. Many of these trends have been amplified by the Covid-19 global pandemic. Individuals, clients, governments, institutions and society at large continue to turn to us to advise and support them in navigating this dramatically changing world of work.
14 Annual Report 2021


“ The Adecco Group’s Future@Work strategy was launched at the end of 2020 and implementation began in 2021.”
Implementing our Future@Work strategy. 
As we ended one strategic business cycle in 2020, all these factors and megatrends fed into the development of our multi-year Future@Work strategy and transformation across the entire Adecco Group. Work started on our transformation journey in January 2021 and included our Global Business Units, enabling functions, regions and countries. Our Future@Work efforts will strengthen the Group’s future as the premier global leader for talent solutions and advisory. The implementation of our strategy will address the shifts in the world of work, and within our business, ensuring the Adecco Group is fit for the future.
The strategic vision that will guide our company for the coming period: ‘Together we will enable sustainable and lifelong employability for individuals, and empower organisations to optimise their talent needs and organisational models to achieve their goals.’
This means supporting people to find and stay in gainful employment to support themselves and their families, and advising organisations to meet their changing talent needs as the demands on their workforces shift to be more digitally-enabled. It enables us to meet the needs of our stakeholders and society at large and helps us deliver against our purpose of “making the future work for everyone.”
Three transformation enablers underpin our Future@ Work strategy and those of each of our Global Business Units: • Customer Experience – putting the customer at the centre of everything we do, delivering a superior customer experience by unifying the way we work.
• Differentiation – we differentiate ourselves from the competition through our unmatched scale and scope and our ability to use our unique 360° ecosystem to power our clients’ transformations, and our candidates’ and associates’ employability and ongoing skills development.
• Digital – digitising our business and the way we work by taking the advantage of technology and data. Deploying leading product innovation, at scale, for the benefit of our clients, candidates, associates – and for ourselves.
With our Future@Work strategy, we are putting long-term, shared value creation at the centre of our strategy. We are committed to embracing a culture that consistently embeds material environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations across our operations and value chain, in the interest of all our stakeholders, the society we are a part of, and the planet we live on.
“ Our Future@Work efforts will strengthen the Group’s future as the premier global leader for talent advisory & solutions.”

COMPANY REPORT. 
Combining the skills and capabilities of our Global Business Units. 
From a practical perspective, the implementation of our strategy and transformation has five elements:
The first three cover the formation of our three Global Business Units, each with its individual ambition and go-to-market strategy.
Next is the development and deployment of our 360° ecosystem.
The fifth and final element is the positioning of the Adecco Group as the strategic parent, transforming the services we provide to the Global Business Units.
Let’s look at each of these elements in a little more detail, starting with the strategies of the three Global Business Units.
The Adecco Global Business Unit is being turned into a global omnichannel partner for workforce solutions, focusing on growing market share and margins through accelerating digitalisation and cost improvement. The Global Business Unit concentrates its efforts on five industries and five service offerings, delivered through a 24/7 omnichannel platform. Our ambition for Adecco is to be the global number one player in workforce solutions and one of the world’s top five employers, with 850,000 people at work. You can read more about the Adecco Global Business Unit on page 26.
When we started the year, our Talent Solutions Global Business Unit (now LHH (Talent Solutions) began to deploy a differentiation strategy under one global LHH (Talent Solutions) brand umbrella, providing end-to-end services from recruitment, training and development through to permanent placement addressing the complex skills and transformation needs of companies. Expectations for LHH (Talent Solutions) are that they lead the change in the human capital market, addressing skill shortages and transformation needs along the entire talent journey with the ambition that they will double in size by the end of this strategic cycle. You can read more about the LHH (Talent Solutions) Global Business Unit on page 30.
And Modis is deploying a specialist strategy to become the global leader in the Smart Industry market. Modis aims at delivering cutting-edge technology, digital engineering and cross-industry expertise to empower societies, organisations, and people to create a smarter and more sustainable tomorrow. The soon to be combined AKKA/Modis, will be the world number two in the outsourced R&D and engineering services market, with the potential and ambition to take the leadership position during the current strategic cycle. You can read more about the Modis Global Business Unit on page 34.
In addition to defining clear strategy and transformation plans for the newly-formed Global Business Units, our Future@Work strategy also focuses on driving the synergies and opportunities for efficiencies across the business units and functions. By combining the skills and capabilities of our three Global Business Units into unique customer-centric solutions, we can create differentiation and ultimately superior value for all our stakeholders.
“ Cross-Global Business Unit collaboration and high performance is the very heart of the Adecco Group’s differentiation.”
Offering a seamless customer experience. 
Through our 360° ecosystem, we aim to offer a seamless customer experience while fostering a culture of cross-Global Business Unit collaboration and high performance.
This is the very heart of the Adecco Group’s differentiation and its successful growth is critical to demonstrating the value added by the Group. The 360° nature of our solutions ecosystem increases our relevance with customers, enabling us to be the strategic partner of choice for talent needs across entire organisations.
Finally, we are positioning the Adecco Group as the Strategic Parent, transforming the services we provide to the Global Business Units. As the Global Business Units are the operators of their businesses, the Group is focusing on five key roles, namely: 1 Delivering and operationalising the strategy 2 Allocating capital and managing talent across the Group 3 Promoting an internal and external connected ecosystem 4 Developing shared services at scale and other Group-wide services 5 Driving social impact and thought leadership.
The Group is also transforming the remaining services and key Group-wide initiatives it provides to the Global Business Units, to ensure these individual business transformations are successful.
Our purpose of making the future work for everyone is our North Star, while our culture sets our compass for how we deliver on our strategy:
People First – prioritises an entrepreneurial, diverse, equal, and inclusive workforce.
Growth Mindset – focuses on and supports agile and unlimited thinking to better serve our customers’ needs.
Collective Spirit – having one united vision and demonstrating collaboration and innovation at scale.
You can read more about these cultural drivers in the People and Culture section on pages 17-21.

Customer first, agile, and unlimited thinking. 
Collective Spirit. 
One vision, collaborative, and innovation at scale. 
It’s been a challenging time, but also one of opportunity. We have seen our organisation come together in a collaborative, agile and innovative way – to quickly put in place a number of guiding principles and protocols to provide the required support to our colleagues, clients, associates and candidates across the world. This is something we are immensely proud of: we are living our vision by making the future work safely for everyone.
As a global leader in HR solutions, we must continue this momentum as we look to the future and evolve more sustainable ways of working. Hybrid working is here to stay, and our approach highlights how we are proactively responding and adapting to this everevolving environment. We are placing emphasis on how we prioritise key activities to drive business performance, whilst continuously managing the wellbeing of our colleagues.
In parallel with the changes happening around us, our Future@Work strategic transformation is all about reimagining how we operate as a business to better serve our clients and customers. We will further advance our business focus, working effectively through agile and hybrid ways of working to stay closer to our clients, candidates, associates, and colleagues. Our people are critical to the success of this transformation and so we will be deliberate around the behaviours we need to prioritise to meet the changing needs of our clients. Using agility, curiosity, creativity and collaborative listening, we are prioritising how we upskill our people to deliver in this new environment and adopt the technology and digitalisation that is available to us.
Attracting and recruiting an empowered, entrepreneurial, and high-performing workforce. 
We must attract and retain the right people with imaginative and customer-centric mindsets, who can help our business and clients win – and so we can deliver our strategic transformation. To increase visibility of our global career opportunities, both internally and externally, we launched a new global careers website in 2020. Across 2021, this platform has undergone a refresh to reflect our new Employee Value Proposition. This has been redefined to communicate our new strategy and tell our story on what experiences and opportunities this will deliver to our people through a flexible brand narrative that can be tailored to the nuances of our business – be that by Global Business Unit, Function or Geography.
With this visibility now in place, As of Q1 2022, we launched our new Recruitment Experience Outsourcing Solution (RXO), in partnership with our own brand, Pontoon. These improved processes, technology, and global efficiencies, will transform how we recruit colleagues into and across our organisation and will ensure we are hiring and retaining the right people, at the right time and for the right role.
“ As a global leader in HR solutions, we must continue this momentum as we look to the future and evolve more sustainable ways of working.”
The way we work has completely shifted and continues to do so. More people are communicating and interacting online and remotely, employees are balancing work with home life, and individuals are finding new ways to manage their wellbeing and develop their skills within the confines of their own home.

People and culture (continued)
COMPANY REPORT. 
Powering an engaged, inclusive, and healthy community. 
A key cultural driver in our Future@Work strategy is ‘People First’ which prioritises an entrepreneurial, diverse, equal, and inclusive workforce. As we continue to build a culture that allows our people to thrive and our organisation to flourish, we are continuing to listen, understand, and respond to the needs of our people. Our annual employee engagement survey provides us with critical insights on where people are more and less engaged. This is a key element of fostering an environment where we give our colleagues regular opportunity throughout the year to express their experiences and drive a culture that promotes transparency and insight-led decision-making – setting the foundations for a continuous and open dialogue.
A key strategic focus and critical to the success of our F@W transformation is in the retention and collective power of an engaged, high-performing workforce. We continue to prioritise our efforts on lowering attrition risk and addressing areas that lead to low engagement. When assessing attrition risk, we look across five key factors: 1 Engagement 2 Loyalty 3 Growth 4 Responsiveness 5 Tenure. 
Using this insight, across 2021 we have made significant progress in three key areas, identified through our employee engagement survey, that contributed to our turnover. Specifically – aligning colleagues’ individual roles to our new strategy (+4 eNPS since Jan 2021), clearly defining career opportunities and career paths (+8 eNPS since Jan 2021), and clarity around how the reward framework links to individual performance (+1 eNPS since Jan 2021). Moving into 2022, we will continue our focus on these priorities and, at the same time, leverage the foundations and strategies in place to ensure our people can continue to deliver whilst placing a stronger emphasis on their health and wellbeing.
In 2021, we built upon our New World Working principles – established in 2020, to help navigate the changing external landscape and build more sustainable working models for the future. We have since launched the New World Working toolkit and delivered an e-learning for new joiners and managers to support our leaders, colleagues, and countries in applying and measuring the impact of these principles within everyday practices – adapting them for cultural variances as well as both professional and personal needs.
As we continue to review and develop our wellbeing agenda, we have taken the time to speak with people from across the business to build on our engagement survey data, understand their needs more specifically and gain insight into how we can truly make a positive impact. This looks both at wellbeing from an organisational support perspective and equally from the individual person’s perspective. Using the Adecco Group Foundation’s Workforce Vitality Model as one of our building blocks, we are working to deliver a global framework that educates, structures, supports, empowers, and communicates wellbeing practices that are integrated with our daily ways of working and delivers results across the full spectrum of purpose, mental, physical, and social wellbeing.
To support this shift, our Win4Youth programme has now transferred from the Adecco Group Foundation into the Human Resources function at Group level, so that we can redefine the focus to incorporate broader areas of wellbeing. Over the past year, the programme’s ambassadors served as champions of wellbeing across the Group, continuing to drive activity of any sort – from walking to yoga to meditation. Each ambassador also had the opportunity to take part in a life-changing experience – including our virtual bootcamp, and a triathlon in Lanzarote, Spain. The number of active participants in the programme across 2021 was 12,718, of which 1,193 were associates and 526 were clients and partners. Across the Group, we logged 1,287,680 activity hours which resulted in a donation of CHF 500,000 to Plan International to support youth employability programmes. To further the evolution of Win4Youth into the broader spectrum of wellbeing, in 2022 we will develop the ambassador programme into a two-year experience with the first year focusing on Win4Youth activities and the second developing them into Wellbeing Champions who look more holistically at driving wellbeing activities and awareness in countries.
All of this is combined with putting equality and inclusion at the heart of everything we do when it comes to accessibility for all and driving an inclusive culture. In 2017 we aligned on a clear company purpose: Make the Future Work for Everyone. This means the Adecco Group strives to make the future work for everyone – including people of colour, women, the LGBTQ+ community, persons with disabilities and more – and for anyone who embraces this vision of a diverse and inclusive culture, demonstrating that we believe in talent not in labels. Please see page 20 for more information on our Diversity and Inclusion agenda.

Giving our colleagues the platforms and experiences they need to reach their potential. 
Our second cultural driver, Growth Mindset, focuses on displaying agile and unlimited thinking to better serve our customers’ needs. In 2021 we launched the Adecco Group University (TAG U) to prioritise the development, through learning, of our colleagues and leaders, focusing on the critical transformational and behavioural skills we need to successfully deliver our Future@Work strategy. TAG U provides a robust learning ecosystem that promotes a culture for continuous growth and development. By the end of the year, more than 1,000 of our colleagues had participated in learning journeys aligned to our critical skills topics including Sales, Pricing, Agile, Digital and Leadership Development. With our unique ‘humancentric’ 360° HR solutions, we can leverage the best learning experiences our brands have to offer. In short, we leverage and apply our own ecosystem. For example, General Assembly delivered a curriculum on Digital Foundations and our 330 Global Leaders are taking part in a six-month Leadership journey which has been co-created with LHH.
In early 2022, we launched our TAG U Digital Campus, driven by a digital learning and development platform, which will be a one-stop shop for learning, accessible to all our colleagues worldwide, anywhere at any time.
And it is not just about strengthening the leaders of today but also building the leaders of tomorrow. Our International Future Leaders Programme nurtures our early-in-career colleagues, equipping a pipeline of strong, commercially minded leaders with the skills, experience, and passion to deliver tangible business performance, drive the pace of transformation and successfully foster a culture of innovation across the Group.
Equipping our talent with the tools to grow and succeed. 
To ensure we are fit for future, our leaders of tomorrow must be nurtured today – and for ongoing business continuity, healthy succession planning is paramount. Through our Global Talent Reviews, we are strengthening and further embedding processes that identify our critical talent and skills gaps, establishing how and where we recruit and develop the talent needed to strengthen these pipelines.
Harnessing our own strength. 
Our third cultural driver of Collective Spirit promotes a united vision through collaboration and innovation at scale. We take pride in leveraging our own unique portfolio of brands and solutions to deliver an excellent employee experience and continue building a world-class HR function. In addition to serving our colleagues and accelerating our business transformation, it also showcases best-in-class practices to our clients. Some examples of how we have demonstrated this across 2021 include: • Partnering with Pontoon to deliver our Recruitment Experience Outsourcing (RXO) solution where we redefine how we recruit colleagues into and across our business globally.
• Working with LHH to collaborate on our leadership development programme, assessments and change management approach. As well as utilising LHH coaching tool Ezra – to support our global development initiatives such as our International Future Leaders Programme, our Female Talent Programme and our Global Leadership Programme.
• We partnered with General Assembly to pilot Digital learning journeys for our colleagues, that will ultimately form, a part of our TAG U curriculum.

COMPANY REPORT. 
Making the future work for everyone. We believe in talent, not labels. 
At the Adecco Group, we are committed to making the future work for everyone. As a people business focused on providing talent solutions and advisory services, we envision a world in which everyone has the chance to participate in the world of work. We seek to foster a culture of belonging and purpose, an environment where everyone can thrive and feel engaged, and where difference is respected and valued. We believe our commitment and active drive to improve everyone’s chances of being part of the world of work is both a critical business advantage and a non-negotiable, integral part of who we are.
As one of the world’s largest employers, we have a responsibility and opportunity to make a real difference in the fight against racism and have an unwavering commitment to standing up against discrimination of any kind. At the Adecco Group, we believe in talent, not labels, and focus on the diverse and unique skills our people bring. We have zero tolerance for any unlawful discrimination or harassment against any employee, associate or candidate, at any stage of that person’s journey with us, on the basis of gender, sexual orientation/ LGBTQIA/gender identity or gender expression, family/marital status, age, race, ethnicity, heritage, nationality, social or economic background or origin, religion/creed, political opinion, disability (visible or invisible), or any other characteristics protected by applicable laws where the Adecco Group operates.
We regularly ask our people to tell us how we are doing and tell us how they feel about us as an employer. We act on their feedback and report back to them on what we are doing to continually strengthen who we are and what we do. We also provide the opportunity for anyone working for the Adecco Group who has individual concerns or worries to raise these in a confidential or neutral environment. More information can be found here: https://www.adeccogroup.com/our-group/about-us/ reporting-misconduct/
Our commitment to equity, equal opportunity, inclusion, and diversity is part of our broader commitment to respecting fundamental human rights across our value chain. It reflects our long-standing pledge to the ten important principles of the United Nations Global Compact and represents an important contribution we can make toward the achievement of the UN Sustainable Development Agenda.
Our approach – Striving for equity by design. 
We work actively to create the conditions that support a culture and work environment of belonging, trust, and participation. To achieve our objectives, we focus particularly on the following four pillars: • Attract, recruit, and retain a diverse range of talent. This not only facilitates the labour market integration of underrepresented groups but also enables us to bring more perspectives, experience, and skillsets into our business to create better results for our people and our customers.
• Drive a consciously inclusive culture through our mindset, decision-making and behaviours. We drive inclusive leadership by ensuring diverse thinking is respected, managed, heard and applied. To support this, we have an active programme of global inclusion training, for both leaders and all employees on the thinking and actions that encourage and promote an inclusive and diverse working environment.
• Enable accessibility and equality for all. We believe in equity by design to minimise barriers and maximise our collective potential for success. We are committed to bias-free and fully inclusive recruitment, talent management and development, reward and recognition, and promotion processes, and continue to invest time and resources in the best technology to create the environments that deliver this.
• Put wellbeing at the heart of everything we do. We are convinced that wellbeing is a cornerstone of an inclusive work environment, valuing mental, physical and cultural wellbeing. We actively provide a range of services and support for needs of everyone in the Adecco Group. We continue to strengthen and develop our approach by using the lessons we have learned to support the wellbeing at work of all our people.

360° ecosystem. 
The pandemic and its aftershock have been pushing companies to re-assess their priorities, sometimes even their entire business model to keep their competitive edge. All sectors have been disrupted, accelerating the shift to more digitalisation, more focus on building resilience, faster transition to smarter industry and real commitment to sustainability.
Collectively, we are still trying to grasp the full impact on the world of work and some of our clients are struggling to cope with the “new normal”.
The war for talent is raging; hybrid work is here to stay; fit-for-future skills are an elusive target; while diversity and inclusion have become imperative for all. In the recent months, the end-to-end people agenda has become the top priority of many CEOs.
And this is where the Adecco Group has a lot to offer. Our 360° ecosystem of services is one of the most comprehensive in the industry and across the world. In the past year, our conversations have shifted to more strategic engagement with our customers, understanding their emerging challenges and opportunities, brainstorming with them on how to support their needs even before they fully verbalise them. While some companies continue to require the immediate, tactical supply of flexible and permanent staff, many more are looking for innovative solutions spanning the entire talent spectrum. In this unchartered era, even old questions require new answers. Today, clients in need of capabilities for their business may be better served by a combination of re-skilling existing staff, hiring new talents and outsourcing the rest. And already 91% of our global strategic customers are leveraging services from across the Adecco Group business units.
Bringing the value of our industry-leading 360° ecosystem to clients is about putting them at the centre, and developing uniquely tailored solutions, built from the range of services from across our Global Business Units. This was our approach for a client in the automotive industry.
Holistic approach helps client pivot to a software focus for the future. 
With the acceleration towards smart, connected, electric-powered vehicles, they were facing the challenge of transforming from a predominantly mechanical engineering and manufacturing company into a software company. As an Original Equipment Manufacturer, this has been driving a significant impact on the skills they require today and for the future. Together with their teams, we created a solution combining career planning from LHH (Talent Solutions) and re-skilling in e-mobility from Modis. By the end of 2021, we had already trained 2,000 internal trainers who in turn will re-skill and up-skill some 30,000 of their fellow employees into the jobs of the future. A very concrete example of making the future work for our client and their employees, ensuring their continued employability and business relevance.
For the Adecco Group, customer centricity is at the core of any meaningful customer conversation. And while it can translate into highly customised offers, it often leads to a smart assemblage of our broad set of services to unlock customer value. In the past year for example, we turned what was a commoditised flexible workforce management brief from a global financial services company into a total talent engagement leveraging LHH (Talent Solutions), our online platform Hired, and Modis. It optimised the impact for the client’s business and ultimately their people. It also enabled us to develop a higher value-adding partnership focused on anticipating their current and evolving workforce needs.
Last, but not least, our clients expect a consistent and predictable experience across brands and countries. This is our commitment to be recognised as a truly global and strategic partner to them. To deliver on that promise, we have made considerable progress on developing deep client and industry expertise and insights, together with training on all the Global Business Units’ offerings. Through our TAG U online learning platform, we also offer ‘self-served’ micro learning sessions to all our employees to support their up-skilling; these received more than 5,000 views during the year.
The 360° ecosystem in action. 
Our clients welcome the new solutions our shift to a more advisory approach provides, exemplified by a client company in the automotive industry. This sector is facing huge challenges as it moves from manufacturing traditional petrol-driven cars to smart, connected, electric-powered vehicles. Our client works as an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) in this sector and is transforming from a predominantly mechanical engineering and manufacturing company to a software company, with significant impact on the skills they will require for the future. We worked with them to jointly create a solution combining career planning from LHH (Talent Solutions) and re-skilling in e-mobility from Modis. By the end of 2021, we had already trained 2,000 internal trainers who in turn will re-skill and up-skill some 30,000 of their fellow employees into the jobs of the future, thus making the future work for them by ensuring their continued employability.

CHRISTOPHE CATOIR. 
Christophe Catoir became President of the newly formed Adecco Global Business Unit in January 2021. He was previously Regional Head of France and Northern Europe. Christophe joined the Adecco Group as an internal auditor in 1995, holding several positions over the years including Finance Manager and Regional Manager, as well as Head of Permanent Placement and Managing Director for Professional Staffing in France.
After one year, can you share what makes you proud at the end of 2021?
Even facing the Covid-19 outbreak, we were able to put people first while introducing our ambitious Future@Work plan that will deeply change our future and the ways we support not only our clients and associates, but also society as a whole. I’m very proud of our 23,500 colleagues all around the world – in 48 countries and 3,620 branches, who worked in an exemplary way throughout what was again a very tough year.
In terms of economic results, 2021 is a real transformation year, with key investments. Of course, we have room for improvement, but we have laid the foundations for our immediate future success.
What were your priorities in 2021?
We had clear priorities, and each demonstrated clear progress during the year.
Growth Obsession: We have reinforced our sales discipline in order to deliver sustainable growth and, by leveraging our segmentation strategy in our main countries, we have been able to reach our goals and support our strategic clients as well as our mediumsized and small local partners.
Qualitative Hiring: In order to strengthen our own workforce, we have hired thousands of new colleagues who discovered the “Power to change lives” by becoming part of our company. By offering real added value to society, we are more attractive than ever to young talents.
Omnichannel: Reinforcing a modern HR customer service (intimacy, advice, coaching, training and safety) for clients and associates, we have created a full set of new ways to deliver our services mixing online and offline.
Unique solutions portfolio: We have set up a global Solutions organisation, leading Adecco Outsourcing, Adecco Training, Adecco Inclusion, and our Flexible and Permanent Placement activities. Developing these new segments for existing clients represents a great business expansion opportunity as we better meet their evolving needs. This new structure facilitates the delivery of tailored sets of services, according to needs (personalisation), and with more room for innovation. We thus provide a unique value to our customers, and we are ready to expand our competitive advantage.
Technology Adoption: Digitalisation is at the core of our strategy and instrumental in the transformation of our business.
Alongside this, we see the growing impact of our innovations with, for example, digital engagements with candidates through Career Assistant growing from 1.1 million in the first quarter 2021 to 2.5 million in the last quarter of 2021.
In data and AI, we have made many developments to our products, making them smarter, more intuitive and easier to use so that our conversational AI bot reached 200,000 potential candidates a month with a quarter of those making an application for temporary or permanent placements.
We also established our global data platform which means that we can now share and analyse our candidate data more effectively including a total of 1.1 million assessments, surveys and training courses completed in 2021.
An Efficient Governance: Adecco is organised around a strong and effective Management Team at global and local level. The Leadership Team has been reinforced and members of the team can now focus on their areas of responsibility, with more proximity to our clients and delivery networks.

COMPANY REPORT Adecco (continued)
Amin Seido Khudeida (27) 27 year-old Syrian Amin Seido Khudeida arrived in Germany in December of 2015 as a refugee. After learning German during temporary work, he was able to apply for a logistics job through Adecco. He did well in this job and was well-liked by everyone and, in 2021, when Adecco sought a team member for staff support and shift planning, Amin was asked to join the internal Adecco team – a role which he has enthusiastically embraced.

In 2021, QAPA joined the Adecco Group. Can you tell us more about this acquisition?
The market for 100% digital recruitment solutions has increased eightfold in the last two years. This acquisition will enable us to accelerate the deployment of a digital offering to meet the needs of our user companies and complete our service offering. Thanks to its technology, QAPA can provide candidates and companies with the right offers and profiles in record time: one hour, on average! QAPA already has several hundred clients and a solid candidate base with nearly 4.5 million profiles. This powerful capability will strengthen our leadership. It is also a great opportunity for Adecco to rapidly gain market share by simply meeting our clients' needs better. Based in France, QAPA will be a laboratory and a model for our global Adecco Direct offer.
What do clients expect from Adecco?
The most important value for our clients, but also for our associates, is trust. They expect from us the capacity to support their path to success with agility, transparency, compliance, and the capacity to provide end-to-end solutions and not only transactional interactions. For example, Permanent Placement – but also up-skilling and re-skilling through Adecco Training – are key differentiators for our clients and for our associates. It is also a way to attract the best candidates.
How do you see 2022?
We will still have to deal with the pandemic and continue to protect our colleagues, associates and clients. But we consider that we have learned so much during the last two years – and we have created so many new ways to deliver our services – that we are now fully prepared to grow despite this context. Clients and associates value Adecco’s ability to help them through the challenges of global scarcity of talent, tension on wages – where clients will need our consultancy – global expectations for more wellbeing and safety at work, local and global combined services and huge training needs. Combined, these capabilities represent a clear competitive differentiator for us in the market. We will continue to invest in technology and in our people to ensure we deliver the best customer experience.
Adecco: at the centre of the transformation of the world of work and making the difference for our candidates and clients • Demographic shift and skill shortage: by combining our Training and Inclusion capacity, we consider that our social impact is a huge opportunity as clients can meet the need for varied competencies in different ways, and can help candidates to choose new career paths • Technological Breakthroughs: our past years’ investments put us in the position to propose new efficient types of services • Reindustrialisation of strategic industries: 50% of our clients are global and with our new omnichannel approach we can support our clients’ development worldwide • Resource scarcity and climate change: Our global approach, combined with the agility that our Solutions deliver allow us to generate new ways to mobilise loyal and expert workforces just when our clients need them, reducing resource consumption and delivering financial efficiency.

LHH (Talent Solutions) COMPANY REPORT. 
Making the future work: LHH (Talent Solutions) “ We will continue to build our end-to-end offering to support our clients along the skill transformation journey”
Gaëlle de la Fosse, President LHH (Talent Solutions) 30 Annual Report 2021


ABOUT SERGIO PICARELLI. 
Sergio has been a member of the Adecco Group Executive Committee since 2009, serving as President of LHH (Talent Solutions) in 2021 and guiding the company through a dynamic period of transformation. In a career that has spanned three decades, Sergio has lent his expertise and steady leadership to a broad range of practice areas, including sales, talent solutions and professional recruitment. In April 2022, he will assume leadership for the newly-formed LHH Recruitment Solutions.
ABOUT GAËLLE DE LA FOSSE. 
The newly appointed President of LHH, Gaëlle, joined LHH (Talent Solutions) in February 2022, to start the latest chapter in a successful career of more than 20 years in consulting, business transformation, digitalisation and brand development. She has gained executive-level experience in countless sectors across many different countries, including France, the United States, Italy, Iberia, and countries in Asia and Latin America. Gaëlle has a proven ability to help client organisations in areas such as recruitment, learning, transition and re-skilling and has a strong track record in executing profitable growth has strategies.
As this Annual Report went to press during the period of the leadership transition, both Sergio and Gaëlle respectively reflect on 2021 and look forward to 2022.
Sergio, throughout 2021, Talent Solutions/ LHH (Talent Solutions) delivered talent advisory services to companies around the world under very difficult circumstances. What did you learn about the world of work?
As 2021 began, everyone assumed we would be returning to a certain degree of “normality.” But we quickly realised this wasn’t to be the case. The world around us had become an even more volatile, uncertain, complex, ambiguous place. Obviously, that had impacts for the world of work.
Many employees began to rethink their career and life choices, particularly as hybrid working opportunities became more common. However, freed from our daily commute into the office, many of us found it harder to draw hard lines between our personal and professional lives. Work-related stress and burnout have increased, and many businesses have been pushed to the brink by acute labour shortages.
To succeed in this environment, companies must transform their workforces so they have the right number of workers with the right skills in the right locations. We can do this by moving away from traditional workforce planning and career management and embracing new tools and strategies. Employers, many of whom are in a war for talent, must offer more flexible career journeys, dynamic re-/ up-skilling pathways and create a new blend of permanent and flexible staffing options to meet their need for skilled talent.
After consolidating under the Talent Solutions brand, the company has gone further with development of a global LHH brand. Sergio, why did you decide to do this?
Although “Talent Solutions” was an apt description of what we do, we didn’t initially intend to use the LHH brand for clients or candidates. Our market research showed that with more than ten independent brands in our portfolio, it would be easier for our clients and candidates to navigate our offerings if we consolidated under one brand. Once we made that decision, research showed that LHH was the perfect, unified brand.
Why? Because LHH enjoys very high brand recognition in the HR services space. The move to the LHH brand is designed to elevate our external profile, and drive growth across the portfolio through an integrated target operating model. Finally, by consolidating around one global brand, we will be much more efficient and effective in our marketing activities.
Sergio, can you tell me more about HIRED and Ezra, the smaller businesses within the Global Business Unit?
Simply put, HIRED and Ezra are digital ventures that have become significant growth platforms for LHH (Talent Solutions).
Launched in 2019, Ezra is a digital platform that delivers professional coaching at scale. Ezra has become a rapidly growing global business. In both 2020 and 2021, Ezra revenues grew by more than 300%, as its client base expanded to include some of the largest and best-known companies in the world. In 2021, Ezra delivered more than 100,000 coaching sessions to leaders working in 80 countries. Despite this success, Ezra has continued building out its platform. Most recently, it created “The Ezra Measure,” which allows client organisations to measure the impact of leadership coaching. Ezra is clearly positioned to enjoy even more growth in 2022.
Hired is the world’s largest AI-driven marketplace for top tech and sales talent. Hired combines intelligent job matching with unbiased career counselling to help people find jobs that allow them to reach their full potential. By providing real-time information and access to equal opportunities, the Hired platform is essential for hiring managers, recruiters, and C-level executives who want to build ambitious, diverse teams. Hired is committed to eliminating unconscious bias in all aspects of hiring by utilising more representative talent pools, diversity goals, customised assessments and salary bias alerts.

LHH (Talent Solutions) (continued)
COMPANY REPORT “ We will continue to invest in areas that provide the best possible content and delivery formats to our clients.”
As we look forward, Gaëlle, what business units will drive growth for LHH (Talent Solutions) in 2022?
We see substantial opportunity in our Recruitment Solutions business. The recruitment market is very active and we should earn benefits both from the new unified LHH brand and from ongoing investments in digital capabilities.
Our Learning and Development business should also see significant growth given the insatiable global demand for digital re-/up-skilling and soft-skill development. We will continue to invest in these areas to provide the best possible content and delivery formats to our clients.
Although Career Transition faces a softer market, mainly driven by low unemployment rates and labour shortages, we are successfully transitioning our product to an internal job mobility solution, which has sparked keen interest from our clients.
On top of capitalising on these trends, we will continue to build our end-to-end offering to support our clients along the skills transformation journey and will look to add new capabilities – especially in HR advisory services and selective digital offerings.
Hazel Mayers. 
Hazel is an Adjunct Professor at Fordham School of Law. She was recently accepted for a General Counsel and Corporate Secretary position at a leading Ed-Tech company in the US following a career break.
“The team from the LHH (Talent Solutions) International Center for Executive Options taught me how to own the marketing of my skills and competencies in professional environments.” The most memorable part of her experience has been working with the phenomenal team, from her inspirational peer advisor, and social media guru, to her superb résumé writer and the big research team, offering support and practical guidance.
Hazel suggests taking a career pause isn’t easy, whether it’s a self-imposed point of reflection, as it was for her, or an because of an unexpected departure. The LHH (Talent Solutions) team brings structure to a chaotic time, by helping executives focus on the heavy lifting early, so they are properly prepared for their search.

Modis COMPANY REPORT. 
Making the future work: Modis “ It is an exciting period for all of us as we are in the unique position of shaping a company that has fantastic opportunities ahead”
Jan Gupta, President Modis 34 Annual Report 2021


Build a market leader in technology consulting, focused on high-growth Smart Industry segments. 
ABOUT JAN GUPTA. 
Jan was appointed President of Modis in 2019. He brings extensive experience in managing global teams in engineering and technology businesses. With a strong academic background in mechanical engineering and business, his career spans more than 20 years in the technology industry.
Your focus is on Smart Industry – what is it and why is it an attractive market to be in?
The world is getting smarter – with smart products, processes, homes – while data analytics and AI are having a major impact as drivers of change. Our clients face these megatrends, including shifting demographics, climate change, digitalisation, shorter product lifecycles, scarcity of skills and automation, which leads them to rethink their strategies and rebuild their operating models. Some examples are: • The transformation in the transportation and mobility sector, with electric, connected and autonomous vehicles • The need to develop new technologies for energy production, like mobile fuel cells • The aerospace industry facing the challenge to build planes with much lower CO2 emissions • The need for smart automated production facilities, where our manufacturing and logistics clients are building “dark” factories, highly dependent on the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence. 
Today, engineering skills, IT skills and Big Data are strongly intertwined, and these examples are just a few areas where our combined competences will make the difference.
We call this market the Smart Industry, and this rapidly growing sector is, in short, where IT and engineering technologies converge into a digital and connected world. The traditional IT and engineering markets are growing in general between 3-6% whereas the Smart Industry sector is growing all over the globe by more than 20% every year. The volume of tech services in the Smart Industry offers major opportunities and has already a size of more than EUR 72 billion.
So we are witnessing a big shift from demand for traditional engineering to digital engineering skills in very specialised areas. With our expertise, know-how and cross-industry capability, we can meet this growing demand from customers facing technological disruptions who need our services and skills to scale their transformation. It is about accelerating innovation and time to market for our clients and partners – working together towards a sustainable tomorrow.
We hear a lot about the combination of AKKA Technologies with Modis, what is the rationale behind this?
Our vision for Modis and AKKA combined is to become a strategic partner of choice for leading companies embracing the Smart Industry.
Combining AKKA as a global engineering and R&D services company with Modis being focused on IT and digital will amplify our strategy. With an incredible portfolio of clients, we will accelerate innovation and drive the future of the Smart Industry and together become a global engineering and digital solutions powerhouse in the market.
Our target remains unchanged: to be a leading enabler of the Smart Industry and the partner of choice for companies, to scale their innovation, improve productivity and accelerate their digital transformation. Our merger with AKKA will help accelerate our ambition to be a global leader in this sector.
With a unique footprint across all major regions – EMEA, North America and APAC – and local presence in over 30 countries and around 50.000 highly experienced engineers and tech experts combined, we have a strong platform to meet our ambitious targets.
For the Adecco Group, the combined AKKA and Modis business increases the exposure to high-value technology-led sectors. AKKA & Modis will be a key element in extending and delivering an even broader and deeper 360° ecosystem to more clients, combining the Group’s skills and capabilities into unique customer-centric solutions. It will strengthen the Group’s world-leading ability to meet the transformation needs of customers, underpinned by talent.

Could you share more about the strategy of the combination of Modis and AKKA?
By combining AKKA & Modis, a global market leader in technology and digital engineering will be created to capture the accelerating demand for digital transformation – the desired partner that so many organisations are looking for – helping clients rethink what and how they produce and generate value out of data.
Blending complementary skills and a global footprint, Modis and AKKA will create a powerful platform to be a global leader in the Smart Industry. We look forward to joining forces with AKKA as they are as passionate about technology as we are. This combination of talent and skills will unleash an extraordinary offering of end-to-end solutions, based on our extensive technology capabilities, cross-sector expertise, and joint strong experience in some of the largest digital engineering sectors. Together we will have a uniquely broad service offering in this field and therefore the answer to all challenges our clients are facing.
We are bringing together colleagues who are experts in engineering, product development, digital twin technology, data analytics, artificial intelligence, and other cutting-edge technologies, along with colleagues who are experts in automotive, aerospace, software and telecom, life science, energy or the financial services. Our focus is on industries that are in huge transformation with a need for digital transformation and high growth rates. Together we will have the chance to work on the most interesting engineering and IT projects in the world.
Our strategy is summarised in a 7x7x4 business matrix (see Figure 1) which displays our focus on seven key growth technologies, seven defined global industries, and four service lines. We have added Emerging Technologies to stay on top of key technology trends such as blockchain or virtual reality. And we keep focusing on key global industries in Smart Industry related sectors; a balanced industry split which makes us more resilient against future economic crises, as all the industries have different economic cycles.
The matrix also clarifies our four key offerings, where our ‘Solutions’ service line enables us to work alongside the full value chain of our clients, from design to prototyping, testing and optimisation of production, allowing for unique customer intimacy.
There is a big integration project to complete during 2022, how are you approaching this?
The integration is a major undertaking and multiple cross-functional teams and a range of workstreams have been established, coordinated by an Integration Management team, led by representatives from Modis, AKKA and The Adecco Group.
From the day we acquired a controlling stake, subject to regulatory approval, we started to establish joint executive leadership, act jointly with clients and work on joint offerings. From that date, we were also able to start to connect our infrastructure, which will be important going forward to operate efficiently. Our diverse global leadership team brings deep knowledge and experience from different industries.
We have scoped the work to be done across many different areas to ensure we maximise our future success. This covers all areas from confirming the organisational structure to how we will go to market, shape our client offering, and combine our delivery and operations.
It is an exciting period for all of us as we are in a unique position to shape a company that has fantastic opportunities ahead. AKKA & Modis, coming together as Akkodis, will support clients, partners and society in their digital transformation journey towards a sustainable tomorrow, through a shared passion for technology and talent, as we engineer a smarter future together.

Strengthening ESG governance and accountability (see pages 40, 72ff. and 96f.)
We are a world in transition, faced with extraordinary shifts that continue to upend the current way business is, and should be, done – from climate change and Covid-19 to societal movements for more equity, access, and equality. The private sector has a critical role to play in helping to rebalance the world for the benefit of all. As a leading talent solutions and advisory company, and one of the largest employers worldwide, we want to lead by example in how we conduct our business, help our stakeholders navigate through these turbulent times, and take an active role in creating brighter futures for all. We want nothing less than to make the future work for everyone. This is our starting and end point for what we do.
Sustainability sits at the heart of Future@Work. 
In 2021, we have made our approach to responsible, sustainable business conduct an integral part of our Future@Work strategy. Sustainability for us is not a one-off effort or something that sits separate from the business. It is – and must be – an integral part of how we do business. We can only be successful as an organisation if we are mindful of the broader impact of our activities and consistently embed material environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations into all that we do, across our value chain. Ultimately, this will help deliver economic value for our shareholders and stakeholders, and positive impact for global and local economies.
To remain focused, we have translated our purpose into strategic goals that address the work-related sustainability needs of our core stakeholders. For us as a people business, focus is particularly on all sustainable employment-related challenges and opportunities. Recognising the need for a stronger human-centric approach to climate change mitigation and adaptation, in 2021 we have elevated our commitment to climate protection to one of these now five overarching goals.
39 Annual Report 2021


Strengthening how we measure our ambition. 
We are serious about our commitments and hold ourselves accountable for our progress towards our goals and commitments. In 2021, we introduced a new ESG Scorecard to better enable us to consistently track progress towards our goals. For each goal, we have identified the most immediate drivers that will help determine success and for each such metric, we have set short-term (annual) and medium-term (2025) targets to chart a clear path forward and ensure continuous progress. Long-term (2030) targets are set for metrics where we already have a consistent track record to extrapolate from.
These metrics are in turn reflected in the Group, Global Business Unit and/or Function scorecards. This allocates responsibility for implementation at source and underscores our integrated approach to addressing ESG-related issues. Select ESG-related performance metrics are furthermore included in the compensation framework of the Group Executive Committee members (see pages 96-97 for more details).
Given the sensitive nature of some of these targets, particularly those that pertain to our core business, the Scorecard as such is not public. However, we remain committed to continuously strengthening what we measure and disclose in line with evolving expectations and regulation and in conversation with key stakeholders.
Evolving how we govern our approach. 
Clearly assigned responsibilities at every level of the organisation are a must if we are to deliver on our ambition and commitments. This starts at the top.
To further strengthen accountability for the delivery of our objectives, in 2021 we introduced a new ESG Steering Committee. It is chaired by the Group CFO and consists of senior representatives from the three Global Business Units as well as select leaders of relevant Group functions, such as HR, Sales, Finance, Public Affairs and Sustainability, all reporting either directly to the Group CEO or to Executive Committee members. In 2021, it met four times, developing the ESG Scorecard and its targets, reviewing progress and identifying gaps to close, agreeing a new due diligence framework, and defining priorities for 2021/2022.
How we conduct our business comes down to the decisions and actions that each of our employees takes, day to day. In 2021, we thus embarked on a journey to increase the awareness and understanding among our colleagues of our approach to sustainable business conduct and the role they can play in helping to drive progress. For example, we integrated ESG in a number of global townhalls, issued an ESG newsletter with best practices from across the Group, and launched new intranet pages that provide tangible actions that all employees can take, as well as examples dependent on role (e.g. for people managers) or area of responsibility (e.g. people working in HR, or IT). We plan to further build on this in 2022 through raising awareness and education activities on ESG-related issues. Because to make the future work for everyone, we need everyone.

Operating responsibly COMPANY REPORT. 
Ensuring responsible tax practices. 
At the Adecco Group, we believe that contributing to public finances through responsible tax practices is an integral part of how we seek to make the future work for everyone and a key contribution we as a business can make towards helping achieve the UN Sustainable Development Agenda. For most countries, tax contributions are the main source of funding. By seeking to comply with both the letter and spirit of applicable tax laws, we ensure we pay our share so that governments can fund critical public services such as education, infrastructure, or healthcare.
We do not engage in artificial tax-driven structures and transactions, and we report revenues and pay taxes in the countries where we operate and where value is created.
EUR millions 2021 2020 2019 Income taxes paid 195 290 256 Sales taxes paid 2,460 2,061 2,535 Employer payroll and social security taxes paid 2,726 2,278 3,049 Total taxes paid 5,381 4,629 5,840. 
For more information on our tax strategy, please refer to page 83.
At the Adecco Group, our most material contributions to sustainable development are those that we strategically advance through our core business. As a leading talent solutions and advisory company we prioritise two areas: enabling the sustainable and lifelong employability of individuals and providing them with access to quality employment, and enabling organisations to optimise their talent models to achieve their own long-term goals, as outlined in previous sections of this report. In a time when the world of work is undergoing such significant change, we believe this role is more important than ever.
This is supported by an unwavering commitment to maintaining the highest standards of responsible and sustainable business conduct. Our ambition is to establish a culture that consistently integrates material environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations – risks, opportunities and impacts both of and on our business – across our full value chain. We continuously evaluate with key internal and external stakeholders whether our focus areas continue to be the right ones and seek to evolve and strengthen our approach in line with evolving legislation, practices, and expectations. We will continue to challenge ourselves and strive to be at the forefront of delivering better futures for all.
Leading with integrity and compliance. 
To be trusted by our stakeholders, we seek to conduct ourselves ethically in everything that we do, in line with both the spirit and letter of applicable laws and accepted norms for corporate behaviour. The ambition of our Integrity and Compliance Programme, launched in 2019, is to help create such a value-based culture: a culture that enables and encourages decision-making and business practice that considers not just what is legal, but what is conduct with integrity, and which demonstrates that our profitability and growth are achieved both in a sustainable way and in accordance with our values. The Board of Directors, through its Audit Committee, exercises oversight over the programme’s implementation, ongoing management, and effectiveness.
Our Code of Conduct sets the frame of reference to which each and every colleague has personally committed, and which underlies the business decisions we make every day. To ensure our Code of Conduct remains fit for purpose, in 2021, we embarked on the critical journey of updating this seminal document. We created a steering committee and stakeholder panel made up of colleagues from across our Global Business Units and enabling functions that guide the drafting. We will ensure we invest the necessary time in this process, recognising that this will set the tone from the top as regards the expected behaviour from our people and those working with and for us for years to come. We expect this extensive process to conclude in 2022.
Operating responsibly. 
All new joiners are asked to complete onboarding training in integrity and compliance, complemented by online training on various related topics that all colleagues are required to complete on a regular basis. At the end of 2021, global completion rate was at 77% for all courses. In 2021, we launched a new Group e-learning module on preventing bribery and corruption in all its forms, in support of our zerotolerance policy. The e-learning reinforces our expectations in this respect and is mandatory for all employees. The phased roll-out was completed in November 2021, with a global year-end completion rate of 63%; this will continue into 2022. We also launched a new course for line managers on our revised Group Commitment Policy to ensure proper decision-making in the interest of the Adecco Group, outlining decision-making authorities and thresholds across the Group.
Building on the valuable experience and insights gained the previous year, we conducted our second Group-wide survey on integrity and compliance, providing our colleagues with the opportunity to share their perceptions of how our company lives up to our respective commitments. Close to 18,000 employees participated (51% of the invited population) and shared their honest feedback, leaving 8,700 comments. Results showed an improvement over the 42 Annual Report 2021


Transparency in compliance and ethics reporting. 
Our reputation is one of our most valuable assets, determined not least by the way each of our employees conducts their respective work responsibilities. Unlawful or improper behaviour by even a single person can cause the Adecco Group and its stakeholders considerable harm. We therefore seek to foster an open culture of mutual respect and trust, where people feel encouraged and safe to seek guidance, to raise any concerns they have relating to possibly improper business conduct, and to report any actual or suspected misconduct. Concerns can be raised through various channels, around the clock, including anonymously.
Anyone raising concerns in good faith is making the right decision: we will listen and take any issues seriously, taking remediating action as required to ensure our practices are in line with our values and ambitions for responsible business conduct. This may include disciplinary measures, training, or process improvements (such as amendment of policies and procedures, awareness campaigns, or implementation of new controls).
Depending on the risk significance (e.g., potential impact on stakeholders, financial impact and/or reputation damage, seniority of the subjects potentially involved), reported cases are divided into red, yellow, or green categories, which determines the further handling of a case. Relevant information on reports is regularly provided to the Board of Directors’ Audit Committee and senior management.
In 2021, the two most reported categories were: • improper workplace conduct (26%); • deception (15%), including e.g. embezzlement or time card fraud.

Focus in 2022 will be on strengthening the response rate to increase representation, fostering more awareness for our ethics reporting tools, and building trust in the underlying process. As a first step, we trained our integrity and compliance colleagues in how to conduct investigations, building capacity and expertise on proper investigation protocols at local levels.
We recognise that our commitment to responsible business conduct needs to extend across our value chain. In 2021, we thus embarked on a journey to strengthen our existing practices, laying out a project framework for action, with implementation starting in 2022. This will enable us to ensure that we are not part of or party to activities, wherever they take place, that do not adhere to high social and ethical conduct, but rather that we work with business partners that share our standards.
To better support and track the implementation of new policies, initiatives, and trainings across the Group, we deployed a governance and reporting tool for the Integrity and Compliance function. In an effort to further strengthen audit trails and accountability, we are working on complementing this with new tools that will allow us to better capture processes such as conflict of interest disclosures and policy attestations. As we implement such new initiatives, we partner with a diverse group of stakeholders from differing functions, Global Business Units, and geographies, to make sure they reflect a broad set of experiences, expertise and contexts.

Operating responsibly (continued)
COMPANY REPORT. 
Respecting human and labour rights. 
We are a business of people for people, touching the working lives of hundreds of thousands of people every day. We are committed to embedding fair and ethical recruitment practices and the respect for workers’ rights in our daily business operations across the world. In our commitments and activities, we are guided by some of the most authoritative international resources, such as the core labour conventions of the International Labour Organization (ILO) or the UN Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights, as well as sector-specific standards such as the World Employment Confederation Code of Conduct and ILO Convention 181 on Private Employment Agencies. We continue to be a steadfast participant in the UN Global Compact, and annually confirm our continued commitment to its ten important principles, ever since first signing up in 2003.
Numerous policies and procedures translate these expectations into our daily business. In 2021, we embarked on an extensive process to revise and strengthen our human and labour rights policy to ensure it remains fit for purpose, to better articulate our longstanding commitments and activities, as well as to reflect evolved expectations as regards a company’s stance and conduct in this fundamental area. We are thereby engaging with a broad range of stakeholders, enabling us to consider a multitude of perspectives and seeking to avoid potential blind spots. Sign-off and roll-out of the new policy is expected in 2022. The respect for human and labour rights will also play a leading role in our revised Code of Conduct, as outlined in the previous section.
We believe that our services and solutions bring many benefits, particularly in the areas of employability and access to work, and thus livelihoods. In 2021, we for example launched Adecco Inclusion and several new partnerships that will enable us to scale up our existing offering focused on increasing the labour market participation of currently underrepresented groups through up- and re-skilling and placing them into jobs with our clients. We also work with our clients to create the enabling environment for diverse talent to thrive.
But we are also mindful of the potential risks to human rights in the context of our business operations. In 2020, we began with the comprehensive mapping of material labour law and human rights risks and corresponding controls in our flexible and permanent placement business in the APAC region. In 2021, we expanded this to our markets in Eastern Europe and the Middle East, with completion in Western Europe and the Americas expected in the first half of 2022. This will enable us to develop a more comprehensive risk matrix and corresponding strategy to reduce the most common risks across our operating countries.
For example, the risk for discrimination in our industry is real. This was one of the key insights gained from our integrity and compliance survey. In response to this, in 2021 we provided guidance to all our employees about what to do if they feel pressured to recruit in a discriminatory way or in a way that is against our values. The guidance focuses on reaching out for support, focusing conversations with clients on their business outcomes and how our services are delivering against these expectations with quality and predictability – and ultimately walking away if necessary. As one of the world’s largest employers, we have a responsibility and opportunity to make a real difference in the fight against racism and have an unwavering commitment to standing up against discrimination of any kind, as expressed in our new global D&I statement, available on our website.
Following the roll-out to managers in 2020, our conscious inclusion training has in the meantime been delivered to 75% of the organisation. Recognising that pictures sometimes speak louder than words, we furthermore issued inclusive imagery guidance to our marketing community, to ensure the photo-/ videography we source, produce and/or use represents and speaks to a diverse range of people across the globe and reflects our commitment to diversity and inclusion. This went hand in hand with an audit of imagery already in use.
With ‘People First’ as one of our three cultural drivers, the concern for the health and wellbeing of our people remained a top priority in 2021, recognising the critical responsibility we have to keep those that enable our success safe. Our industry is unique, as we typically do not directly control the work environment we place our associates in. This is acknowledged by applicable legislation, often placing primary responsibility for a healthy and safe workplace with the client. Nevertheless, we seek to ensure they are properly trained and equipped for the respective role ahead. In 2021, we formed an Occupational Health and Safety Community, initially in our six largest markets, to share best practices, streamline metrics and measurement to be able to identify improvement areas, and innovate new approaches. In partnership with Adecco Training, they developed a quiz for associates to build their awareness for healthy and safe practices at work, tailored to different industry needs; roll-out has already been completed for three markets. For an overview of how we seek to ensure the wellbeing of our colleagues, please see page 18.
We recognise the important role that social dialogue plays in safeguarding human and labour rights. In 2021, we continued our active engagement in social sectoral dialogue for agency workers in numerous countries and as a partner at the European Sectoral Social Dialogue for Agency Work facilitated by the European Commission. On the European level, social partners WEC-Europe and UNI-Europa agreed their new work programme for 2021-2023. Additionally, the sector contributed to a joint statement by all social partners in the services industry. Our Adecco Group European Works Council (AEWC) continued to enable meaningful social dialogue between the Adecco Group management and European employees through elected employee representatives, based on the spirit of good faith and mutual trust. In 2021, we had several meetings to continue our exchanges including dialogue on the impact of Covid-19 as well as European-level transnational matters. We had seven meetings between the management and the AEWC Steering Group, consisting of five members who work on behalf of all employee representatives. The Adecco Group organised two meetings for all AEWC employee representatives – one exceptional virtual meeting to discuss the business and ongoing impact of Covid-19, and one hybrid annual plenary meeting at which we signed a joint summary with commitments for the future.

Contributing to the Sustainable Development Agenda 2030. 
The ‘Agenda 2030’ and its underlying 17 Sustainable Development Goals, adopted by the member states of the UN in 2015, set out a clear path towards ending extreme poverty, fighting inequality and injustice, and protecting our planet. There are many touchpoints between the SDGs and the world of work, which connects all social partners and is the principal provider of livelihoods and security. It’s crucial, now more than ever, for labour market stakeholders to come together and realise the tremendous opportunity – and responsibility – they have to create a more sustainable future. As one of its prominent actors, we are fully committed to playing our part, to harness our expertise and resources to contribute to the achievement of this important vision. We focus particularly on those goals where we can have the biggest impact, while directly and indirectly contributing to many more:
In 2021, we launched a new SDG-focused campaign shining a light on our collective responsibility, as shapers and participants in the world of work. It leverages our expertise to make employment a key driver of sustainable development and provides insights for next steps employers can take towards the achievement of the 2030 agenda.

COMPANY REPORT. 
Helping advance meaningful public policy. 
To be able to deliver on our purpose of making the future work for everyone, we depend on governments creating the enabling environment, crafting balanced policy, and ensuring well-structured and functioning labour markets that can provide opportunities and protections for all types of workers. Given the complexity of the challenges the world, and not least the world of work, faces today, governments increasingly seek the expertise and support of active labour market participants with deep expertise such as the Adecco Group.
Our public affairs activities, advocacy, and thought leadership are all aimed at policy-making processes relevant to the Group’s core business of building a better world of work for all. We are a leading voice in the need for workforce up-skilling and re-skilling at scale, and a vocal advocate for a new social contract that provides for adequate social protection for all, pointing the way towards a future that works for everyone. We are transparent about the positions we advocate for and regularly publish our viewpoints on our website. In 2021, we launched position papers on a wide range of labour market topics, including: • “Remote work – How to make it work for everyone”: the Covid-19 pandemic has disrupted the way companies organise work and by now data suggests that remote or hybrid forms are here to stay. This paper outlines the challenges inherent in these new work models (such as inequalities; productivity; cost, wages and taxes; and cybersecurity), provides an overview of existing legislation, and suggests several factors governments should consider in structuring legislative frameworks for remote work to ensure these boost productivity, foster a better work-life balance and address talent scarcity, while safeguarding that this transition is inclusive, fair and profitable for all.
• “The career guidance imperative – Maximising investments in work transition support”: work transitions occur today more frequently than ever before, and the size of the skills mismatch challenge cannot be overstated. Consequently, governments are putting significant efforts into supporting the necessary workforce shifts, often by strengthening active labour market policies or significantly incentivising skilling. We advocate that career guidance, if used strategically within public work transition support mechanisms, can help ensure the most effective use of public resources and be a direct lever for a fast economic transition, and offer concrete recommendations to all labour market stakeholders on how to tackle this.
• “Delivery pending – How to drive a better instant delivery platforms world of work”: the gig economy, and especially instant delivery, provides new opportunities to serve consumer needs and turn available work into real jobs. But the sector has been grappling with challenges regarding workers’ expectations. As stakeholders look to navigate their way to the most appropriate framework for the instant delivery platforms industry and move to policy standard-setting, we propose a range of solutions for creating a more balanced relationship between delivery platforms and affiliated workers, and advocate for three guiding principles that best meet the needs of all parties at stake.
We are keen to take responsibility within our broader industry. Our actions include interactions with and towards institutional stakeholders and relevant policymakers, such as government bodies and elected officials, as well as with other stakeholders such as social partners, think thanks and academics. Both the Group and our brands hold memberships and play active roles in various trade and industry associations, at global and local levels. These groups play an important role in representing our industry in the public debate, as they advocate for public policies that support innovation and that will benefit workers, businesses (including ours) and society as a whole.
Since 2020, we for example hold the presidency of the World Employment Confederation (WEC), our global industry federation, and since 2021 now also have a seat in the WEC-Europe Executive Committee, which ensures that the Adecco Group is truly taking its responsibility in organising the sector. In 2021, we also joined the delegation of Swiss employers participating in the International Labour Conference discussion focused on skills. We furthermore continue to be active in the wider business community, partnering e.g. with the International Organisation of Employers and holding a membership in BusinessEurope, including many of their national member federations.
To ensure our public affairs activities are reflective of our expectations as regards integrity, compliance, and responsible business conduct, in 2021, we finalised and rolled out our Public Affairs Principles and Guidelines, publicly available on our website. These define how we liaise with political and institutional decision-makers and what we expect of ourselves and our partners in our public affairs-related activities throughout the world. To this effect, they include a mandatory third-party due diligence process for any public affairs agency we work with.

Managing environmental opportunities and risks. 
Climate change is one of the most defining challenges facing society today and upending the current way business is and should be done. While the environmental footprint of a service company like ours and the interlinkages between the world of work and climate change might not be as evident compared to those of other industries, we recognise the responsibility we have to help safeguard the planet for future generations, and the difference we can make by acting responsibly. And we have a long tradition of doing so. As a reflection thereof, in 2021 we elevated Climate Protection to one of our overarching sustainability goals. To achieve this, we focus on two distinct pillars:
I. Helping facilitate a human-centric green transition. 
At the Adecco Group, we believe that climate action must be labour market action. The move towards a net zero economy demands a tremendous industrial transformation that will likely exacerbate existing societal challenges. It is critical that we take a human-centric approach to climate change mitigation and adaptation and prioritise investments in people to ensure that the green transition is a just and inclusive one. We must marry the E with the S dimension rather than see them as distinct. This will not happen by default but will require decisive action by everyone.
Key actions needed to realise the opportunities of the Green Economy. 
Governments • Enable flexible and functional labour markets and sophisticated education systems • Deliver inclusive social protection systems that protect workers, not jobs • Include human capital development strategies into national climate action plans. 
Individuals • Be pro-active and take ownership of your own skillset by continually seeking skilling opportunities • Realise that skills expire and that lifelong learning is a prerequisite for longterm employability. 
Employers • Start mapping skills requirements and get re-skilling and re-employment underway ahead of the curve • Provide entry points into the labour market by embracing apprenticeships, Vocational Education and Training (VET) and other forms of work-based learning • Promote flexibility and leverage workforce expertise by putting the individual at the centre of your business transformation • Make sustainable employment and skills investment a brand advantage to attract the right talent and retain skills for future success. 
Yet, there is still a significant disconnect between climate goals and the needs of workers. Many institutions (in both the private and public sectors) make ambitious commitments towards emissions reductions and more circular business models, often however without a clear understanding of what that means in terms of their workforces – the skills they have, the skills they need, and how to bridge the gap – as well as for their supply chains, communities and consumers. Governments and employers must pay more attention to the role human capital and skills play in delivering sustainable change.
To raise awareness of this, at the beginning of 2021 we published a policy paper, “Skills for the Green Economy”. This outlines concrete recommendations for all stakeholders aimed at helping foster resilience and readying the labour market for what lies ahead. The paper also includes tangible case studies from the highly impacted energy and automotive industries to illustrate the points made. We further advocated for the active consideration of the impact on people and their skills e.g., in an online dialogue we hosted together with representatives from the European Commission, the European Parliament, and the private sector, as well as spoke to this effect on a panel at the UN Climate Conference COP26 in Glasgow, where we were present for the first time.

Carbon emissions reduction target by 2030 with 2018 as the base year. 
Complementing our advocacy work, we also directly up- and re-skill workers into the jobs of the future and support our clients with their talent needs as they work through this transition. LHH (Talent Solutions), for example, enables sustainable re-industrialisation that helps save livelihoods and accelerates the transition towards a greener and more circular economy. Working with clients and public authorities, LHH (Talent Solutions) identifies ways to mitigate the social impact when “unsustainable” businesses close and layoffs are unavoidable.
By mapping existing skills and offering up- and re-skilling and career guidance to workers, new employment opportunities can be found that address the needs of the local economy and provide workers with a new perspective. In 2021, LHH (Talent Solutions) for example successfully transitioned workers from a closing coal mine in Spain to newly created solar power jobs in the same region, thus maintaining meaningful and sustainable economic activity in the region, boosting the Spanish green energy sector, and supporting the labour market’s attractiveness.
A holistic, collaborative, and human-centred approach is key to success and ensuring that the green transition works for everyone.
II. Managing our own environmental footprint. 
At the Adecco Group, we recognise the impact we have on the environment through our operations and business relationships. We are committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030, by reducing our carbon emissions by 50% (with 2018 as baseline), both in terms of absolute emissions and intensity (per unit of revenue and FTE, for Scopes 1 and 2), and offsetting remaining emissions. We set this ambitious reduction target in line with the methodology of the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), consistent with the level of decarbonisation required to keep global temperature increase to 1.5°C compared with pre-industrial levels. We are in the process of exploring the necessary steps towards a formal submission to the SBTi, and as part of this the requirements for further strengthening our targets and efforts to account for external developments and expectations towards a net-zero commitment.
We are mindful that the Covid-19 pandemic had a tremendous downward impact on our emissions over the past two years, and will likely have a lasting impact beyond. We expect emissions to increase again as we transition out of the pandemic, but will work hard to try to limit these effects and continue on the year-on-year emissions reduction path we have set out for our organisation. We will focus on those areas where we see the biggest reduction potential given the nature of our business:
ESG ratings and indices. 
In 2021, our ESG-related performance was recognised with the following rating results and distinctions: • CDP Climate Change: B- • EcoVadis: Gold rating • FTSE4Good Index Series constituent • MSCI ESG rating: AA • Sustainalytics: ‘Outperformer’ • Reducing business travel and using lower-carbon alternatives: while we permitted business travel again given the high value of in-person engagement and collaboration with clients, colleagues, and key stakeholders, we instituted new guidelines that require that any travel must be prioritised for purpose, impact and people. These also stipulate that prior to any booking the environmental and carbon impact must be considered (in addition to health and safety standards), keeping in mind the existing option of remote working.
• Increasingly decarbonising our car fleet: all of our key markets now have policies in place that foresee the overall reduction of their car fleet and the replacement of remaining vehicles with low-carbon alternatives. Australia for example was able to reduce its car fleet by 80%.
• Improving energy efficiency within our facilities and switching to lower-carbon alternatives: our US operations for example significantly optimised their office space to account for changed working needs, while our UK operations moved to 100% renewable energy sourcing, with our German operations following suit as of 2022.
We furthermore embarked on a comprehensive process to revise our global environmental policy in collaboration with stakeholders across the Group, to further articulate our approach to the management of environmental risks and opportunities and specify minimum standards and expectations.
Beyond the strategic efforts we can drive centrally, we see our employees as playing a critical part in helping us reduce our environmental footprint. In 2021, we therefore launched a number of awareness-raising and engagement activities, such as e.g., a global “You pledge-we plant” initiative, where we committed to plant a tree for every employee pledging a concrete action they can take to help reduce our environmental impact or promote otherwise sustainable behaviours in the workplace.

Our environmental data. 
The Adecco Group reports in line with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. Data is collected across our 19 largest markets, representing more than 90% of our workforce and more than 85% of global revenues. To account for 100% of our operations, missing values of reporting countries are modelled, and the total of all reporting countries is then extrapolated for non-reporting countries of the Adecco Group. This is calculated based for example on office square footage, number of FTEs, and recognised standards (e.g., Greenhouse Gas Protocol and ecoinvent database), taking into consideration factors such as country energy mix or heating degree day per country.
Over the course of the reported year (20201), we saw an overall year-on-year emissions reduction of 41%, significantly outperforming our target. This was largely driven by offices being vacated aside from essential teams required (Scope 1) and business travel restrictions (Scopes 1 and 3) as a consequence of the Covid-19 pandemic.
We are continuously working on increasing data transparency, quality, and coverage of our environmental performance reporting to reduce our reliance on extrapolations. To this effect, in 2021, we implemented data quality and methodology improvements that led to slightly restated data for the last years, and an adjustment of our current 2030 target. We also started collaborating with experts to explore options to measure the commuting of our associates as well as strengthen our processes to enable limited external assurance of our data over time.

This does currently not include e.g. employee/ associate commuting or emissions from our supply chain. 3 The Adecco Group calculates Scope 2 emissions according to Greenhouse Gas Protocol’s market-based methodology. 4 In 2021, we implemented data quality and methodology improvements which led to slightly restated data for 2018 and 2019.

Strengthening of margin through delivery of the strategy. 
Note: all growth rates are year on year on an organic basis, unless otherwise stated. 
Overview. 
The Adecco Group delivered a strong performance in 2021, despite the continuing public health crisis linked to Covid-19. Revenues, gross margin and EBITA margin all improved when compared to prior year, driven by the delivery of the strategy and the economic recovery. Meanwhile, investments in the digitalisation and transformation of the Group continued.
Revenues increased by 7% on a reported basis, and were up 9% organically, driven by a broad-based recovery across client industries. The revenue trend by quarter was impacted by the comparison base in the previous year: growth was 2% in the first quarter, 29% in the second quarter (as it was the quarter most affected by the Covid-19 economic crisis in 2020) and then softened to 9% growth in the third quarter and 1% growth in the last quarter, all on a trading days adjusted (TDA) basis. Adecco’s revenues were up 9%, LHH (Talent Solutions)'s revenues rose 8%, while Modis’ revenues grew by 8%. Group revenues for full-year 2021 were 7% below full-year 2019.
Gross margin was up 100 basis points (bps) in reported terms, and up 110 bps organically, driven by portfolio, better mix and pricing.
EBITA margin excluding one-offs was 4.6%, up 100 bps, or 90 bps organically, with the gross margin expansion partly offset by the investments in sales capacity to capture the growing demand as economies recover and in digital transformation.
Free cash flow was EUR 590, illustrating the partly counter-cyclical nature of cash generation. DSO was 51 days, 1 day below 2020. During the year the Group distributed EUR 365 in dividends. Net debt ended the year at EUR 48, representing a ratio of 0.0x net debt to EBITDA excluding one-offs.
Revenues increased by 2% in Q4 2021 organically and 1% TDA. During 2021, the Group focused on protecting profitability, through agile cost management and commercial discipline. As the pandemic eased in the second half of 2021, the Group accelerated investment in a focused and disciplined way to improve growth momentum.
For 2022, macro-economic indicators point to robust economic growth, despite geopolitical uncertainty and lingering pandemic-related challenges. In Q1 2022, the Group expects solid revenue growth on a year-on-year basis, with modest sequential improvement. The Group’s margin will reflect continued investment, particularly in Adecco, that is anticipated to accelerate sustainable, profitable growth.

Return on Invested Capital. 
Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) measures the Group’s ability to efficiently use its invested capital. ROIC is defined as rolling four quarter EBITA excluding one-offs divided by average invested capital.
Invested capital comprises Goodwill, Intangible assets (gross), Property, equipment, and leasehold improvements, Operating lease right-of-use assets, Net working capital excluding cash (Trade accounts receivable and Other current assets, less Accounts payable and accrued expenses), and Other non-current assets.
Invested capital was EUR 4,872 as at 31 December 2021, compared to EUR 4,560 as at 31 December 2020. The year-on-year increase was primarily attributable to higher net working capital requirements to support revenue growth. Net working capital as a percentage of revenues was 2.1%, compared to 1.4% in the prior year.
ROIC was 20.3% for 2021, up 580 basis points year on year. The increase primarily reflected higher rolling four quarters EBITA excluding one-offs, supported by strong management of average invested capital.
The following table presents the calculation of invested capital and ROIC:

Segment performance. 
All growth rates are year on year on an organic basis, unless otherwise stated.
Adecco. 
In Adecco, total revenues increased by 9% with growth driven by France and Southern Europe & EEMENA. EBITA excluding one-offs amounted to EUR 834 in 2021, up 43% year on year. Reported EBITA of EUR 820 included one-offs of EUR 14. In 2021 the EBITA margin excluding one-offs was 4.9%, an increase of 110 basis points year on year reflecting positive operating leverage from higher volumes, better mix, productivity gains and cost discipline. Further details by region can be found below.
Adecco France. 
In 2021, revenues increased by 15%, to EUR 4,665, reflecting the market recovery, led by growing demand from logistics and manufacturing clients while automotive was challenged.
EBITA excluding one-offs amounted to EUR 277 in 2021, up 50% year on year. Reported EBITA of EUR 270 included one-offs of EUR 7. In 2021 the EBITA margin excluding one-offs was 5.9%, an increase of 130 basis points year on year driven by positive operating leverage and partially mitigated by investments in growth and increased employee profit sharing linked to regulatory changes.
Adecco Northern Europe. 
Revenues performance varied across the region. Revenues in Benelux and the Nordics rose by 2% and 11%, respectively. Revenues from the UK & Ireland were 6% lower, impacted by tough comparison period from exceptional contract wins in the prior year. Permanent placement revenues were strongly up, by 61%.
EBITA excluding one-offs amounted to EUR 86 in 2021, up 65% year on year. Reported EBITA of EUR 80 included one-offs of EUR 6. In 2021 the EBITA margin excluding one-offs was 3.4%, an increase of 130 basis points year on year driven by better mix, productivity gains and cost discipline.
Adecco DACH. 
Revenues in Germany increased by 10%, Switzerland and Austria grew by 4%. While demand was strong in manufacturing and healthcare, automotive was muted.
EBITA excluding one-offs amounted to EUR 57 in 2021. Reported EBITA of EUR 61 included one-offs of EUR -4. In 2021 the EBITA margin excluding one-offs was 4.0%, an increase of 440 basis points year on year driven by improved mix and pricing, as well as the benefit of restructuring actions in Germany during 2020.
Adecco Southern Europe & EEMENA. 
In Italy, revenues increased by 30%, while Iberia was up 11% and EEMENA 2%. Growth was driven by strong demand in manufacturing and logistics. Permanent placement revenues were up by 56%.
EBITA amounted to EUR 235 in 2021, up 40% year on year when compared to prior year EBITA excluding one-offs. In 2021 the EBITA margin was 6.0%, an increase of 90 basis points when compared to prior year EBITA excluding one-offs, supported by higher volumes, better mix from successful diversification (e.g. outsourcing, training), pricing and cost discipline.
Adecco Americas. 
In North America, revenues were 6% lower, with the recovery held back by lower exposure to the more dynamic areas of the economy, such as logistics and transportation, subdued activity in the automotive sector and lowered workforce availability. Measures to improve the US performance are underway, with the business implementing an omnichannel operating model with central hubs (Talent Factories), and digital channels, as well as refocusing its sales force on higher growth sectors. In Latin America, revenues were 18% higher. Legislative changes in Mexico that prohibited temporary staffing had a significant negative impact on the result. Permanent placement revenues were up by 94%.
EBITA excluding one-offs amounted to EUR 69 in 2021, down 23% year on year. Reported EBITA of EUR 66 included one-offs of EUR 3. In 2021 the EBITA margin excluding one-offs was 2.8%, a decrease of 70 basis points year on year. Gross margin expansion was fully offset by incremental investment in digital and sales capacity as part of the turnaround plan that will drive improved performance in 2022.
Adecco APAC. 
Growth was strong in Australia & New Zealand, where revenues increased by 16%. In Japan and Asia growth was solid, with revenues up by 7% in both regions. In India, revenues declined by 9%, linked to the exit of certain lower-margin activities.
EBITA excluding one-offs amounted to EUR 110 in 2021, up 15% year on year. Reported EBITA of EUR 108 included one-offs of EUR 2. In 2021 the EBITA margin excluding one-offs was 5.7%, an increase of 30 basis points year on year supported by improved mix and cost efficiencies.
LHH (Talent Solutions)
Revenues benefited from strong growth in Global Professional Recruitment, up 17%, and US Professional Recruitment, up 19%, with both segments leveraging strong market demand for permanent placement. Pontoon’s revenues grew by 5%, led by MSP and RXO. Career Transition and Learning & Talent Development revenues were 10% lower, as the strength of the US economic recovery curtailed demand for career transition services. Revenues in General Assembly were 7% lower, with softer demand from B2C courses outweighing higher demand in B2B and B2G.
EBITA excluding one-offs amounted to EUR 150 in 2021, down 1% year on year. Reported EBITA of EUR 118 included one-offs of EUR 32. In 2021 the EBITA margin excluding one-offs was 8.3%, a decrease of 90 basis points year on year mainly reflecting a shift in business mix away from career transition and including investments in digital.
Modis. 
Revenue growth was broad based, led by the Americas, where revenues were 14% higher. In APAC, revenues grew by 5%, while in the EMEA region, revenues grew by 6%. Technology Consulting activities grew by 9%, Tech Talent Services by 6% and the Tech Academy by 127%.
EBITA excluding one-offs amounted to EUR 142 in 2021, up 20% year on year. Reported EBITA of EUR 132 included one-offs of EUR 10. In 2021 the EBITA margin excluding one-offs was 6.5%, an increase of 80 basis points year on year, benefiting from positive pricing and mix, improved bench utilisation, and reflecting continued investment in sales and global resources.
Outlook. 
Revenues increased by 2% in Q4 2021 organically and 1% trading days adjusted. During 2021, the Group focused on protecting profitability, through agile cost management and commercial discipline. As the pandemic eased in the second half of 2021, the Group accelerated investment in a focused and disciplined way to improve growth momentum.
For 2022, macro-economic indicators point to robust economic growth, despite geopolitical uncertainty and lingering pandemic-related challenges. In Q1 2022, the Group expects solid revenue growth on a year-on-year basis, with modest sequential improvement. The Group’s margin will reflect continued investment, particularly in Adecco, that is anticipated to accelerate sustainable, profitable growth.

COMPANY REPORT. 
Operating and financial review (continued) in millions, except share and per share information 58 2021 Annual Report. 
Controls and compliance. 
The Company is committed to maintaining the highest standards of ethical business conduct. The Company’s Chief Human Resources Officer and the Head of Group Compliance Reporting oversee worldwide business ethics and compliance practices and report regularly on these topics, depending on their nature, to the Audit Committee or to the Governance and Nomination Committee. In addition, the Company’s Head of Group Internal Audit reports directly to the Audit Committee.
The Board of Directors and management of the Company are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s Internal Control Over Financial Reporting as at 31 December 2021. In making this assessment, management used the principles established in the updated Internal Control – Integrated Framework (May 2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment, management has concluded that, as at 31 December 2021, the Company’s Internal Control Over Financial Reporting is effective.
The Company’s internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company’s management and the Board of Directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of its published consolidated financial statements. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective may not prevent or detect misstatements and can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statements preparation and presentation. Furthermore, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Forward-looking statements. 
Information in this Annual Report may involve guidance, expectations, beliefs, plans, intentions or strategies regarding the future. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. All forward-looking statements included in this Annual Report are based on information available to the Company as at 9 March 2022, and the Company assumes no duty to update any such forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements in this Annual Report are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results could differ materially from the Company’s current expectations. Numerous factors could cause or contribute to such differences. Factors that could affect the Company’s forward-looking statements include, among other things: • global GDP trends and the demand for temporary work; • changes in regulation affecting temporary work; • intense competition in the markets in which the Company operates; • integration of acquired companies; • changes in the Company’s ability to attract and retain qualified internal and external personnel or clients; • the potential impact of disruptions related to IT; and • any adverse developments in existing commercial relationships, disputes or legal and tax proceedings.

COMPANY REPORT. 
Cash generation and capital allocation. 
Annual Report 2021 61. 
Cash generation and capital allocation. 
The Adecco Group consistently delivers strong cash generation.

In 2021, cash flow from operating activities was EUR 722 million, broadly unchanged year on year and reflecting reduced days sales outstanding, mitigated by increased use of cash to fund growth. Free cash flow was EUR 590 million, up 5% year on year. Cash conversion was 83%, approaching the Group’s 90% target level.
The Group assesses returns using a Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) calculation. ROIC was 20.3% for 2021, up 580 basis points year on year with the increase primarily reflecting higher full-year EBITA excluding one-offs, supported by strong management of average invested capital.
The Adecco Group’s capital allocation priorities are: 1 Fund organic growth at attractive returns 2 Progressive dividend policy 3 Selective M&A, creating value 4 Return excess cash to shareholders. 
The Group’s progressive dividend policy has two elements. As earnings grow over time, our dividend per share (DPS) will also grow, within the bounds of a payout ratio of 40-50% of adjusted earnings per share (EPS). Second, we are committed to holding our Swiss Franc DPS at least in line with the prior year period, even if EPS temporarily declines and the payout ratio is exceeded.
The Adecco Group paid EUR 365 million in dividends during 2021. For 2021, a dividend of CHF 2.50 will be proposed to shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 13 April 2022. The proposal is in line with the Group’s progressive dividend policy, representing a payout ratio of 56% of 2021 Adjusted EPS.
A number of acquisitions and divestments were completed in 2021 to reinforce the Group’s core business activities and accelerate delivery of its Future@Work strategy: • In July, the Group announced the intention to acquire AKKA Technologies, and merge the business with Modis; • In August, the Group announced the acquisition of BPI Group, an HR advisory company in France, and the planned divestment of its US-based Legal Solutions business; • In September, the Group announced the acquisition of QAPA, the number two provider of fully digital workforce solutions in France.
In February 2020, the Board of Directors approved a share buyback programme of up to EUR 600 million, which was started on 7 April 2021. On 28 July 2021, in relation to the acquisition of AKKA, the programme was put on hold; 1,424,388 shares for CHF 88 million were acquired under this programme and are intended for subsequent cancellation, following shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting on 13 April 2022.
Note: • 2012 programme was completed in September 2013; • 2013 programme was completed in November 2014; • 2014 programme was completed in January 2016; • 2017 programme was completed in March 2018; • 2018 programme was completed in March 2019; • 2020 programme has a total value of EUR 600 million and was partly executed over April – July 2021.

Risk management and principal risks. 
COMPANY REPORT. 
Identify, mitigate and manage risk. 
Enterprise risk management – an iterative and integrated management practice. 
Embedded in the strategic planning process, the enterprise risk management process at the Adecco Group is a management practice. It provides assurance to all key stakeholders that we will achieve our performance, profitability, and targets and objectives related to environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations. While the focus is on analysing, managing and mitigating risks, we pay equal attention to identifying opportunities for business development.
The process is conducted on a regular basis, steered by Group management and overseen and approved by the Board of Directors. Country and business line management teams are involved as well as Group management and corporate functions, to ensure consistency and comprehensive coverage by leveraging the expertise of the people in the organisation close to the risks. This is consolidated through an unbiased and honest view of those risks that can have a significant impact on their operations and their ability to meet objectives. Where needed, action plans are developed, and progress is reviewed during regular operational business meetings. The enterprise risk management assessment, including the action plan, is reported back to the Board of Directors.
Key business risks. 
The following describes our major business risks and how we manage them. These are regularly reviewed and updated as deemed necessary to account for changes in the risk environment, reflecting new and/or emerging influencing factors such as for example the Covid-19 pandemic, geopolitical developments, or major acquisitions.
Key business risks Description Mitigation. 
Geopolitical, social and economic uncertainty. 
Demand for many of our HR solutions is highly correlated with changes in economic activity. Meanwhile, career transition is counter-cyclical in nature. At the same time, we operate in a labour market going through significant change, accelerated by the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic: the workforce skills an organisation requires today may be obsolete in few years’ time. The economic, social and political environment is increasingly volatile and staffing companies must adjust their capacity to fluctuations in demand, which can occur rapidly and over which they may have limited visibility.
The Adecco Group has leading positions in most major geographical markets and HR service lines. The diversity of our exposures provides some natural hedge to the risk of changing economic conditions. Nonetheless, we place a high priority on closely monitoring economic developments, how these influence our clients’ demands, and their impact on our financial results. Our crisis management approach, supported by an active dialogue between corporate and regional management, allows us to stay abreast of any business developments and swiftly adjust our capacity levels as required. The response to the Covid-19 pandemic confirmed the Group’s readiness for a recession and its ability to both ensure a continued stable dividend distribution and create value for its stakeholders. This is assessed on an ongoing basis.
Client attraction and retention. 
The Adecco Group’s results and prospects depend on attracting and retaining clients. Client satisfaction, as a result of services we have rendered, is a key driver of client retention and therefore needs to be monitored closely. The changing world of work also provides an opportunity for new sources of growth and the attraction of new clients.
We emphasise the importance of acting as a partner to clients to help them satisfy their workforce solutions needs. On a regular basis we measure client NPS. The results are used to train and support sales teams, to draft and execute sales action plans, and to further enhance the services we deliver. At the same time, we continuously strive to broaden the services we offer and industries we serve (e.g., through acquisitions), improve our delivery channels and to optimise sales systems and processes, leading to enhanced client attraction. The customer has been placed as the cornerstone of our Future@Work strategy, as we seek to leverage 360° HR solutions whilst transforming into a more brand-driven organisation. We recognise our clients’ increased expectations as regards responsible business conduct across their supply chain and are intent on meeting their objectives through our integrated sustainability framework.
Our risk management process is used to identify and mitigate our exposures and, where possible, to turn risks into business opportunities. By effectively managing our risks, we are able to maintain our resilience through challenging periods such as that presented by Covid-19, and ensure we continue to create value for our stakeholders.
Risk identification. 
Risk mitigation. 
Monitoring Risk analysis 62 Annual Report 2021


Key business risks Description Mitigation. 
Associate attraction and retention. 
We depend on our ability to attract and retain candidates and associates who possess the skills and experience to meet our clients’ needs. With talent shortages in some highly qualified skillsets, providing suitably qualified associates can be challenging.
We aim to attract the best talent through various sources, ranging from the traditional physical branch to online platforms and technologies using digital tools responsibly. Our value proposition for candidates and associates goes beyond providing employment opportunities or consecutive assignments. We also provide training and career coaching, and help solve skills shortages with our up- and re-skilling solutions which improve access to diverse candidates, including in some of the most in-demand fields such as digital and IT skills. We regularly measure our candidate NPS to help identify and respond to their needs.
Employee attraction and retention. 
Our success depends on the talent and motivation of our people. Hiring and retaining the right talent in the right job may significantly influence the business prospects of the Adecco Group. Talent and skills are becoming an increasingly limited resource, as companies compete for the best people. The loss of key colleagues, with valuable experience in the global HR services industry or with strong customer relationships, could cause significant disruption to our business.
At the Adecco Group we have developed a comprehensive talent framework aimed at enabling us to remain the leading employer in our industry. We provide a unique offering and rich experiences, helping our people thrive and develop across multiple brands and geographies. We measure our progress via regular internal employee surveys, which gauge employees’ engagement and satisfaction with their workplace. In response to Covid-19, we created and rolled out an entire suite of tools and resources to support our colleagues during these continuously challenging times. Find out more on pages 17-21.
Information Technology. 
IT plays a pivotal role in today’s business operations. Key business processes, such as client and candidate management, and search and match between roles and candidates, are dependent on IT systems and infrastructure. Among other consequences, a significant system interruption could result in material disruptions to our business.
We undertake ongoing assessments of our global security and IT infrastructure and continue to holistically improve our approach to security. This includes strengthening data security measures and helping ensure rapid detection and efficient response. To protect business continuity, critical business applications are stored in cloud applications and regional datacentres with failover capability. Regular reviews of agreements with IT service providers and enhancements to service-level and contract management are embedded in our IT processes, as is the continuous improvement of user security awareness.
Changes in regulatory/ legal and political environment. 
The HR solutions industry requires appropriate regulation, with the ultimate goal of enhancing quality standards to the benefit of society, workers, private employment agencies and their clients. A changing political environment might lead to inappropriate or unbalanced regulation, potentially impacting our business model.
The Adecco Group monitors and evaluates, at regional and local level, any changes in the regulatory and legal environment, and promotes actions and initiatives directed at improving working and employability conditions, while ensuring competitiveness and growth of economies. We are a founding member of the World Employment Confederation and hold leadership mandates in the regional and national associations representing our sector. Our engagement extends to global institutions such as the International Labour Organization, the OECD, the International Organisation of Employers and the G20-B20, as well as BusinessEurope. Find out more on page 46.
Compliance with laws and regulations. 
The Adecco Group is exposed to various legal risks, including possible breaches of law in the areas of employment and discrimination, competition and bribery. The Group holds information on a large number of candidates and associates, bringing additional risks in the rapidly developing area of data privacy laws.
Our global Integrity and Compliance Programme sets our ambition level and overarching framework for our employees to comply with all applicable legislation and internal policies. Training courses on material issues create awareness among employees of the risks of non-compliance. In particular, the Adecco Group requires all employees to adhere to our Code of Conduct. Regular legal updates, as well as periodic audits of branches and local operations, are among our preventive measures. Any issue or concern can be reported confidentially through our publicly available ethics reporting channels. Find out more on pages 42-43.
Disruptive technologies. 
New distribution channels and data-driven business models are emerging as HR solutions go digital. This creates the risk that some of the Adecco Group’s services could in the future be offered differently and / or by new competitors. Over the longer term, these disruptive technologies could present a threat to the market share and profitability of the Adecco Group.
At the Adecco Group, the potential of digital is embraced as part of Future@Work through a combination of internal ventures, partnerships and targeted M&A. Continuous investment in our IT platform allows us to increase our efficiency and effectiveness and provides the infrastructure for a comprehensive and coordinated response to the emergence of new technologies. The Group is placing further emphasis on the growing digital scope of our business and focusing aggressively on new opportunities for growth. At the same time, we will continue to look to build more synergies between the Group’s online and offline businesses, and to further develop opportunities with leading technology partners.
Data protection and cyber security. 
With increasing digitalisation, the ability to provide a data environment meeting the highest security and regulatory standards, such as GDPR, is critical. Any failure to do so, whether due to a lack of appropriate technology, controls or human error, could result in a loss of trust among our candidates, associates, employees and clients, as well as financial penalties. There is an increased level of specialisation and sophistication in the cyber-crime economy, especially in human-operated ransomware attacks.
The Adecco Group is continually investing in cyber security-related processes and systems. With investments in compliance resources, business processes and technology, the Group is complying with relevant data privacy principles established by law. To mitigate the risks, a global privacy strategy has been defined which consists of embedding privacy in the Group’s day-to-day operations, securing compliance with applicable laws, and working to turn data privacy and compliance into a competitive advantage in the long run.
Environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors. 
The Group needs to identify, manage and respond to ESG risks and opportunities impacting its business and stakeholders, and live up to its public commitments such as towards the UN Global Compact. Demonstrating this ability strengthens the Group’s reputation, helps safeguard our licence to operate, drive profitable growth and deliver value for all our stakeholders.
The Group has a long-standing commitment to doing business sustainably. An integrated sustainability framework focused on the issues most material to our business and stakeholders guides our actions and ensures strong alignment between key business and ESG risks and opportunities. Embedded governance structures and a comprehensive measurement framework enable focused implementation, as we move towards a culture that consistently considers ESG dimensions across our business and extend our approach to acquisitions and joint ventures within our sphere of influence.

Authorised capital amounts to a maximum of CHF 305,620.00, which equates to 1.82% of the existing share capital of CHF 16,822,417.70. Increases in partial amounts shall be permitted. For details on the terms and conditions of the issuance/creation of shares under authorised capital, refer to Art. 3bis of the AoI (https://aoi.adeccogroup.com).

For details on the terms and conditions of the issuance/creation of shares under conditional capital, refer to Art. 3quater of the AoI (https://aoi.adeccogroup.com).

On behalf of the Board, the Chair exercises the ongoing overall supervision and control of the course of business and the activities of the CEO and the EC and he conducts regular exchanges with the CEO and other members of the EC.

With its members as stewards of the Company, the Board has thus ultimate responsibility for the overall strategic direction and oversight of these matters, but has assigned certain of these duties and responsibilities to its Governance and Nomination Committee. There is regular engagement between this Board committee and the relevant management functions who address these issues on a day-to-day basis, with the Board receiving formal updates at least twice a year.

Further information. 
Annual Report 2021 81. 
Further information 6. Shareholders’ rights. 
Please also refer to the AoI (https://aoi.adeccogroup.com).
Information rights. 
Swiss law allows any shareholder to obtain information from the Board during the General Meeting of Shareholders provided that no preponderant interests of Adecco Group AG, including business secrets, are at stake and the information requested is required for the exercise of shareholders’ rights. Shareholders may only obtain access to the books and records of Adecco Group AG if authorised by the Board or the General Meeting of Shareholders. Should Adecco Group AG refuse to provide the information rightfully requested, shareholders may seek a court order to gain access to such information. In addition, if the shareholders’ inspection and information rights prove to be insufficient, each shareholder may petition the General Meeting of Shareholders to appoint a special commissioner who shall examine certain specific transactions or any other facts in a so-called special inspection. If the General Meeting of Shareholders approves such a request, Adecco Group AG or any shareholder may within 30 days ask the court of competent jurisdiction at Adecco Group AG’s registered office to appoint a special commissioner. Should the General Meeting of Shareholders deny such a request, one or more shareholders who hold at least 10% of the equity capital, or shares with an aggregate nominal value of at least CHF 2 million, may within three months petition the court of competent jurisdiction to appoint a special commissioner. Such request must be granted and a special commissioner appointed if the court finds prima facie evidence that the Board has breached the law or did not act in accordance with Adecco Group AG’s AoI (https://aoi.adeccogroup.com). The costs of the investigation are generally allocated to Adecco Group AG and only in exceptional cases to the petitioner(s).
Dividend payment. 
Adecco Group AG may only pay dividends from statutory reserves from capital contribution, and statutory and voluntary retained earnings, in accordance with Art. 675 of the Swiss Code of Obligations.
Companies whose principal purpose consists of participations in other companies may freely use the statutory reserves from capital contribution and statutory retained earnings to the extent they exceed 20% of the paid-in share capital. Pursuant to Art. 671 para. 1 of the Swiss Code of Obligations, 5% of the annual profits shall be allocated to the statutory retained earnings until the statutory reserves from capital contribution and the statutory retained earnings have reached 20% of the paid-in share capital. In addition, pursuant to Art. 671 para. 2 and para. 4 of the Swiss Code of Obligations, companies whose principal purpose consists of participations in other companies shall allocate to the statutory reserves from capital contribution and statutory retained earnings the following: (1) any surplus over nominal value upon the issue of new shares after deduction of the issuance cost, to the extent such surplus is not used for depreciation or welfare purposes; (2) the excess of the amount which was paid-in on cancelled shares over any reduction on the issue price of replacement shares. The statutory reserves from capital contribution and statutory retained earnings amounted to CHF 659 million as of 31 December 2021 and to CHF 409 million as of 31 December 2020, thereby exceeding 20% of the paid-in share capital in both years.
In 2021 the AGM approved a dividend for 2020 of CHF 2.50 per share outstanding (totalling CHF 403 million, EUR 364 million). For 2021, the Board of Directors of Adecco Group AG will propose two dividends for a total of CHF 2.50 per share outstanding for the approval of shareholders at the 2022 AGM, consisting of a dividend of CHF 1.25 which shall be allocated from Adecco Group AG’s reserves from capital contribution to free reserves and subsequently distributed to shareholders, and a dividend of CHF 1.25 which shall be directly distributed from available earnings 2021.
Say on pay. 
Each year, the AGM will be asked to approve the proposals submitted by the Board concerning the Maximum Total Amounts of Remuneration (MTAR) of the Board and of the EC (Art. 14bis of the AoI; https://aoi.adeccogroup.com).
Liquidation and dissolution. 
The AoI do not limit Adecco Group AG’s duration (Art. 1, sec. 1 of the AoI; https://aoi.adeccogroup.com).
Adecco Group AG may be dissolved and liquidated at any time by a resolution of a General Meeting of Shareholders taken by at least two-thirds of the votes. Under Swiss law, Adecco Group AG may also be dissolved by a court order upon the request of holders of Adecco Group AG shares representing at least 10% of Adecco Group AG’s share capital who assert significant grounds for the dissolution of Adecco Group AG. The court may also grant other relief. The court may at any time, upon request of a shareholder or obligee, decree the dissolution of Adecco Group AG if the required corporate bodies are missing (see also Art. 731b of the Swiss Code of Obligations). Adecco Group AG may also be dissolved following bankruptcy proceedings.
Swiss law requires that any net proceeds from a liquidation of Adecco Group AG, after all obligations to its creditors have been satisfied, be used first to repay the nominal equity capital of Adecco Group AG. Thereafter, any remaining proceeds are to be distributed to the holders of Adecco Group AG shares in proportion to the nominal value of those Adecco Group AG shares.
Further capital calls by Adecco Group AG. 
Adecco Group AG’s share capital is fully paid up. Hence, the shareholders have no liability to provide further capital to Adecco Group AG.
Subscription rights. 
Under Swiss law, holders of Adecco Group AG shares have pre-emptive rights to subscribe to any issuance of new Adecco Group AG shares in proportion to the nominal amount of Adecco Group AG shares held by that holder. A resolution adopted at an AGM with a supermajority may suspend these pre-emptive rights for material reasons only. Pre-emptive rights may also be excluded or limited in accordance with Adecco Group AG’s AoI (Art. 3bis sec. 4, Art. 3quater sec. 2 and Art. 14 sec. 3 of the AoI; https://aoi.adeccogroup.com).
6.1 Voting rights and representation restrictions.

6.3 Convocation of the General Meeting of Shareholders. 
Notice of a General Meeting of Shareholders must be provided to the shareholders by publishing a notice of such meeting in the ‘Swiss Official Gazette of Commerce’ (‘Schweizerisches Handelsamtsblatt’) at least 20 days before the meeting. The notice must state the items on the agenda and the proposals of the Board and the shareholders who demanded that a General Meeting of Shareholders be called or asked for items to be put on the agenda. Admission to the General Meeting of Shareholders is granted to any shareholder registered in Adecco Group AG’s share register with voting rights at a certain record date, which will be published together with the invitation to the General Meeting of Shareholders in the ‘Swiss Official Gazette of Commerce’ (‘Schweizerisches Handelsamtsblatt’).
6.4 Agenda of the General Meeting of Shareholders. 
Under Swiss corporate law, an ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders shall be held within six months after the end of each fiscal year (Annual General Meeting of Shareholders).

In addition, an Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders may be called by a resolution of the shareholders adopted during any prior General Meeting of Shareholders or, at any time, by holders of shares representing at least 10% of the share capital.
The Swiss Code of Obligations governs the right to request that a specific item be put on the agenda of a General Meeting of Shareholders and discussed and voted upon. Holders of Adecco Group AG shares whose combined shareholdings represent an aggregate nominal value of at least CHF 100,000 (Art. 11 sec. 2 of the AoI; https://aoi.adeccogroup.com) or holders of Adecco Group AG shares representing at least 10% of the share capital have the right to request that a specific proposal be discussed and voted upon at the next General Meeting of Shareholders; such inclusion must be requested in writing at least 40 days prior to the meeting and shall specify the agenda items and proposals of such shareholder(s) (Art. 11 sec. 2 of the AoI; https://aoi.adeccogroup.com).

There are no specific rules regarding the granting of exemptions from the above deadline. 7. Changes of control and defence measures 7.1 Duty to make an offer. 
The AoI of Adecco Group AG do not contain any opting-up clause in the sense of Art. 135 para. 1 FMIA as in force since 1 January 2016 (https://aoi.adeccogroup.com). Therefore, pursuant to the applicable provisions of the FMIA, if any person acquires shares of Adecco Group AG, whether directly or indirectly or acting together with another person, which, added to the shares already owned, exceed the threshold of 331/3% of the voting rights of Adecco Group AG, irrespective of whether the voting rights are exercisable or not, that person must make an offer to acquire all of the listed equity securities of Adecco Group AG. There is no obligation to make a bid under the foregoing rules if the voting rights in question are acquired as a result of a donation, succession or partition of an estate, a transfer based upon matrimonial property law, or execution proceedings, or if an exemption is granted.
7.2 Change of control clause. 
There are no change of control clauses in place in favour of members of the Board or members of the EC. In accordance with the Company’s AoI (https://aoi.adeccogroup.com), long-term incentive plans of the Company may provide for an accelerated vesting in case of a change of control (see section 4.4 ‘Long-Term Incentive Plan’ in the Remuneration Report). 8. Auditors. 
Each year, the AGM of Adecco Group AG elects the statutory auditor (Auditors). On 8 April 2021, the AGM elected Ernst & Young Ltd, Zürich, as statutory auditor of the Company for the business year 2021.
Ernst & Young Ltd has served the Company as its Auditor since 2002, the engagement being renegotiated annually. In line with Swiss regulation, periodic rotation of the auditor in charge (lead auditor) of maximum seven years is executed. Jolanda Dolente, licensed audit expert, is in her third year as the lead auditor after two years as global co-coordinating partner. Marco Casal has for the first time assumed the global co-coordinating partner role.
In 2022, the Company intends to invite several audit firms, including Ernst & Young, to participate in a tender process that will lead to the selection of an audit firm to be proposed for election at the Annual General Meeting 2024 as statutory auditor of the Company for the business year 2024.
The total fee for the Group audit of the Company and for the statutory audits of the Company’s subsidiaries for the business year 2021 amounted to EUR 7.1 million. For the business year 2021, additional fees of EUR 0.6 million were charged for audit-related services such as advice on matters not directly related to the Group audit and primarily relate to certifications required by tax and government authorities to confirm the correct application of specific tax and government rules. Fees for tax services and other services amounted to EUR 0.1 million, mainly related to the application for an employee wage subsidy.

Annual Report 2021 83. 
The AC oversees the Company’s financial reporting process on behalf of the Board. In this capacity, the AC discusses, together with the Auditors, the conformity of the Company’s financial statements with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and the requirements of Swiss law.
The AC regularly meets with the Auditors, at least eight times a year, to discuss the results of their examinations, and the overall quality of the Company’s financial reporting. During 2021, the Auditors attended all meetings and phone conferences of the AC. The Auditors regularly have private sessions with the AC or its Chair, without the CEO, the CFO, or any other member of the EC attending. The AC assessed with the Company’s Auditors the overall scope and plan for the 2021 audit of the Company. The Auditors are responsible for expressing an opinion on the consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and the requirements of Swiss law. Further, the Auditors are required, under the auditing standards generally accepted in the United States, to discuss, based on written reports, with the AC their judgements as to the quality, not just the acceptability, of the Company’s accounting policies as applied in the Company’s financial reporting, including the consistency of the accounting policies and their application and the clarity and completeness of the financial statements and disclosures. Further, the Auditors are responsible for expressing opinions on the standalone financial statements of Adecco Group AG.
The AC oversees the work of the Auditors and it reviews and assesses, at least annually, their independence, qualification, performance and effectiveness. It discusses with the Auditors the Auditors’ independence from management and the Company, and monitors audit partner rotation. The AC considers the compatibility of non-audit services with the Auditors’ independence and pre-approves all audit and non-audit services provided by the Auditors. Services may include audit-related services, tax services and other services.
The AC proposes the Auditors to the Board for election by the General Meeting of Shareholders and is responsible for approving the audit fees. Each year a proposal for fees for audit services is submitted by the Auditors and validated by the CFO, before it is submitted to the AC for approval. 9. Information policy. 
The AGM for the fiscal year 2021 is planned to be held on 13 April 2022 without shareholders being physically present. Shareholders can only exercise their voting rights via the Independent Proxy Representative. The details will be published in the ‘Swiss Official Gazette of Commerce’ (‘Schweizerisches Handelsamtsblatt’) at least 20 days before the meeting.
Adecco Group AG provides quarterly media releases on the Company’s consolidated and divisional results as per the following agenda: 5 May 2022 Q1 2022 results; 4 August 2022 Q2 2022 results; 3 November 2022 Q3 2022 results.

10. Tax strategy. 
The Company operates a Group-wide policy on tax that is regularly reviewed by the Board’s AC. Relevant guiding principles, processes and controls have been defined and implemented throughout the Company. Tax matters are regularly discussed at the AC meetings. The Company reports revenues and pays taxes in the countries where it operates and value is created. The Company seeks to protect value for its shareholders and fully complies with both the tax law in all countries where it operates and international standards, namely OECD standards. The Company’s internal transfer pricing guidelines stipulate that all intercompany transactions must be performed at arm’s length. These guidelines are under constant review and follow the recommendations issued by the OECD. By communicating in a transparent way, the Company works towards fostering mutually constructive and open relationships with tax authorities and also with the purpose of reducing the risk of challenge and dispute. The Company also seeks to remove uncertainty and financial risk by entering into contemporaneous tax audit programmes or advanced agreements with tax authorities where possible. We believe that contributing to public finances through paying taxes responsibly is an integral part of our purpose of making the future work for everyone. The Company does therefore not engage in artificial taxdriven structures and transactions.
The Company files the Country by Country Report (CBCR) in Switzerland. The information is automatically exchanged with the tax authorities of the majority of the countries where the Company operates. By filing an accurate and comprehensive CBCR, the Company ensures that the relevant tax information is appropriately disclosed. Since the information is automatically exchanged, the Company considers it currently not necessary to publish the CBCR on its website. The Company has also implemented the EU Mandatory Disclosure Directive (DAC 6) allowing to ensure local compliance in the countries where the Company is required to report directly. We are committed to continuously exploring ways to strengthen what we disclose and where to build trust and accountability with our stakeholders. 11. Blocking periods 11.1 Ordinary blocking periods. 
At the Company, the ordinary blocking periods shall begin on the last day of any fiscal quarter of Adecco Group AG and shall end one trading day after the public release of earnings data for such fiscal quarter.
The ordinary blocking periods shall apply to directors, officers or colleagues of the Company and cover listed securities and related financial instruments including derivatives (‘Securities’) of Adecco Group AG (‘Adecco Securities’).
11.2 Extraordinary blocking periods. 
The Corporate Secretary of the Board of Directors or the CFO, after consultation with the Group General Counsel, the Head of Group Treasury, the Group Head of Communications, and the Head of Investor Relations, of Adecco Group AG are authorised to prohibit specific groups of individuals which may include directors, officers and colleagues of the Company from trading in Adecco Securities and/or specified Securities of other listed companies, if the Company is involved in an undisclosed material transaction or due to other inside information. Such prohibition shall be lifted by the Corporate Secretary or the CFO one trading day after (i) the information on such transaction or other circumstance has been publicly released, or (ii) the related transaction has been definitively stopped or the related circumstances have ceased to exist, respectively.

remuneration for the CEO of CHF 5,054,798. The improved performance of the STIP, together with the voluntary salary reduction of 20% for six months in 2020, contributed to a higher gross cash remuneration for the CEO in 2021 compared to 2020.
The 2021 total remuneration for the EC members (comprising the CEO, the nine active EC members and one former EC member that stepped down in 2020) was CHF 23,531,063. Stronger EBITA margin performance and higher achievements for strategic and functional performance KPIs contributed to higher annual STI payouts in 2021 compared to 2020.
No one-off awards were issued to active or former EC members in 2021 apart from the limited one-off grants awarded to select members of the EC in 2021 for outstanding performance in 2020 (awarded as part of the 2021 LTIP grant and disclosed in last year’s report).
Remuneration Report and Outlook 2022. 
Considering the feedback received from shareholders and proxy advisors, we enhanced this year’s Remuneration Report by clearly demonstrating the link with the current remuneration structure and our strategic cycle, Future@Work. Furthermore, our roadmap to achieve environmental, social and governance (ESG) goals is included to provide more detail of how our ESG journey is integrated into our current strategy and reflected in EC remuneration.
Reflecting our obligation and commitment to shareholders regarding transparency in EC remuneration, we would like to draw attention to the following enhancements and changes for 2022: • Revenue growth for the Adecco Global Business Unit will be measured relative to industry peers in 2022. Measurement of topline performance relative to industry peers at the Group level is unchanged for 2022; • A new STIP KPI has been introduced in 2022 to measure the success of the integration of AKKA; • The shareholding requirement for all EC members has increased by 50%. The CEO will now be required to hold a minimum of 60,000 Adecco Group AG shares and other EC members will be required to hold a minimum of 15,000 Adecco Group AG shares within five years of the March 2022 annual grant; and • The blocking period for all LTIP participants has been reduced prospectively from two years to one year, in line with competitive benchmarks and with the intention to ensure attractiveness and retention. The blocking period for the CEO is unchanged at two years.
Amendments are described in more detail in section 6 – Outlook 2022.
More detailed information on the Compensation Committee’s activities and on our remuneration approach is contained within this Remuneration Report. The report will be submitted to a non-binding, consultative vote by shareholders at the AGM 2022. We trust that you will find this report informative and thank you for your support.
Sincerely,
Didier Lamouche Chair of the Compensation Committee 1. Introduction. 
Dear shareholders,
On behalf of the Board of Directors (Board) and the Compensation Committee, I am pleased to present the Remuneration Report of the Adecco Group for 2021. It follows a similar structure to last year’s report, which was supported by over 90% of shareholders at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) of April 2021.
At the AGM 2021, we welcomed a new Board member, Rachel Duan, to the Compensation Committee.
Overview of 2021. 
The Compensation Committee continued to engage in direct dialogue with shareholders and proxy advisors to obtain feedback on the remuneration structure for the Executive Committee (EC) and the Remuneration Report. Feedback from shareholders and proxy advisors indicates that the current remuneration structure is aligned with the Company’s remuneration principles and the strategic business cycle, Future@Work. The discussions have positively contributed to the changes in the long-term incentive plan (LTIP) for 2021 and 2022.
During 2021, the Covid-19 pandemic continued to cause widespread economic disruption and present new challenges that have had a significant impact on our people, clients, communities and performance. As a result, the path to recovery will remain somewhat uneven in the months ahead. The EC members’ focus continues to be on securing the wellbeing and safety of our colleagues, associates and candidates and ensuring business continuity for our clients throughout the crisis.
2021 was the first full year implementing our long-term Future@Work strategy and the new brand-centric organisation structured around three Global Business Units: Adecco, LHH (Talent Solutions) and Modis. Each Global Business Unit made good progress executing its specific targets, delivering a record gross margin and sector-leading EBITA margin that reflects the strength of this portfolio and our focus on higher value services. The EBITA margin achievement for the Group exceeded the stretch target resulting in 150% payout for this key performance indicator (KPI).
The acquisition of AKKA Technologies and QAPA demonstrate our intention to position our Global Business Units as worldwide leaders in their respective industry segments. In parallel, Adecco continues to address and deploy digital business models, tools and go-tomarket strategies. The 2022 STIP balanced scorecard will include a new KPI to measure the success of integrating AKKA and Modis (together forming Akkodis on 24 February 2022) by reducing expenses through synergies. In addition, the Akkodis revenue growth target for 2022 will reflect a combined revenue target aligned to the acquisition plan approved by the Board in 2021.
The Compensation Committee has sought to ensure that the remuneration structure appropriately reflects the Adecco Group’s Future@Work strategic priorities. Significant employee turnover induced by the Covid-19 crisis has required us to review our reward programmes to ensure they remain attractive and support retention.
2021 Executive performance. 
The CEO will be awarded a 2021 annual STI of CHF 1,334,205 which is just below target based on actual STIP KPI achievements for 2021.
This annual STIP performance outcome and the share awards granted in 2021 under the LTIP, combined with the annual base salary and social contributions, resulted in a 2021 total conferred. 
Introduction. 
REMUNERATION REPORT. 
Remuneration Report 85 Annual Report 2021


Our three strategic priorities of Future@Work:
Three distinct go-to-market strategies and value propositions/offerings;
Focus on strengthening customer experience, delivering differentiated services and the digital enablement of everything we do; and. 
Delivering social impact alongside a strong commitment to continue to reduce our environmental footprint and enhance our societal contribution.
Introduction (continued)
REMUNERATION REPORT. 
Remuneration at a glance. 
Remuneration principles. 
Remuneration linked to strategy. 
The Adecco Group’s remuneration philosophy is to appropriately recognise and reward performance. It reflects the Company’s commitment to attract, motivate and retain talent in order to support the achievement of Future@Work (the strategic business cycle launched at the end of 2020). Variable incentives are an important element of the remuneration structure. This philosophy is translated into KPIs that are designed to deliver key strategic and functional objectives.
A significant portion of total remuneration for EC members, including the CEO, is tied to the achievement of financial objectives.
The variable incentive element is “at risk” pay (i.e. performance-based remuneration). The annual STIP payout increases or decreases based on the achievement of financial, strategic and functional KPIs. The STIP focuses leadership on outperforming the competition and delivering strong revenue and EBITA margin. The financial goals of Future@Work, specifically the stretched revenue growth and EBITA margin targets, make up 70% of the 2021 STIP balanced scorecard for all EC members underpinning the Adecco. 
Group’s commitment to deliver leading total shareholder returns.
The Adecco Group’s transformation to a digital organisation is supported by other financial-based KPIs that specifically measure progress of the transformation and of the Adecco Group’s digitalisation of client and candidate interactions, as well as the use of digital products internally. In addition, three of five key sustainability goals are reflected in the 2021 STIP balanced scorecard for all EC members: employer of choice, employability and access to work, and trusted partner to clients.
Long-term, share-based remuneration is linked to business performance through three equally-weighted long-term financial-performance objectives: relative total shareholder return (rTSR), return on invested capital (ROIC) and cash conversion ratio (CCR). These metrics are aligned to the financial goals of Future@Work, ensuring that the financial interests of management are aligned with those of shareholders.
Variable incentives are balanced by fixed pay to ensure an appropriate pay mix for the CEO and the other EC members. The annual base salary and benefits support the attraction and retention of the best global talent to help deliver the Future@Work strategy.
Reward for performance. 
The STIP and LTIP seek to recognise and reward Group, Global Business Unit or customer performance. Thus, as a general rule, individual targets are not used in the incentive plans. The STIP incentivises management for achieving the annual financial targets and for attaining strategic and functional goals over a time horizon of one year, and fosters collaboration between the Global Business Units. The LTIP incentivises management to create long-term shareholder value.
Alignment to shareholders’ interests. 
The LTIP is delivered in the form of share-based remuneration and thus aligns the interests of management with those of shareholders. Furthermore, based on the shareholding guideline, EC members are required to hold a minimum number of Adecco Group AG shares which encourages an owner-manager culture.
Internal fairness and external competitiveness. 
The remuneration is internally consistent and externally competitive. Base salaries are generally set at the median level of the relevant function in the reference market, which is either local, regional or global. Local benefits are defined in line with local regulations and competitive practice. Total remuneration is reviewed periodically to ensure competitiveness in attracting and retaining talent while maintaining internal equity.

REMUNERATION REPORT Remuneration governance 2. Remuneration governance 2.1 Legal framework. 
The Adecco Group’s Remuneration Report is written in accordance with the requirements of the Swiss Ordinance against Excessive Compensation in Listed Companies and the Directive on Information relating to Corporate Governance, issued by the SIX Swiss Exchange. The Adecco Group’s principles regarding remuneration further take into account the recommendations set out in the Swiss Code of Best Practice for Corporate Governance of the Swiss Business Federation (economiesuisse). In addition, the Remuneration Report comprises information as required under the Swiss Code of Obligations.
Statements throughout this Remuneration Report using the terms “the Company” or “the Group” refer to the Adecco Group, which comprises Adecco Group AG, a Swiss corporation, its consolidated subsidiaries, as well as variable interest entities for which the Adecco Group is considered the primary beneficiary.
2.2 Role of the shareholders. 
The shareholders annually and prospectively approve the Maximum Total Amount of Remuneration (MTAR). For the EC, the amount is approved for the following financial year and for the Board it is approved for the period from this AGM until the next AGM. The shareholders also vote for the Remuneration Report in a retrospective consultative vote. Authority for decisions related to remuneration (see Illustration 1) is governed by the Articles of Incorporation, which are available on the Company website: https:// www.adeccogroup.com/investors/shareholder-information/ articles-of-incorporation/, and the Compensation Committee Charter.
The following limits are applicable to EC variable remuneration according to the Articles of Incorporation: • At target, the EC may earn up to 125% of its aggregate annual base salary as an annual cash bonus and for the CEO, up to 120% of his annual base salary. If targets are exceeded, the EC may earn up to 150% of its aggregate annual base salary as an annual cash bonus and for the CEO, up to 140% of his annual base salary.
• Long-term incentive plans foresee remuneration in the form of restricted shares or rights to shares in Adecco Group AG. At grant, the fair value of the awarded share units shall not exceed 150% of the aggregate annual base salary of the EC nor shall it exceed 160% of the annual base salary of the CEO. Vesting is to be conditional upon the fulfilment of certain conditions over a number of financial years.
Remuneration paid to members of the Board is comprised of remuneration due until the time of the next AGM plus any estimated social insurance payments and other fringe benefits. The Board may determine that a portion of the remuneration is to be paid in the form of shares according to the Articles of Incorporation.
2.3 Role of the Board and Compensation Committee. 
In line with the provisions of the Articles of Incorporation, the Board has entrusted the Compensation Committee to provide support in establishing and reviewing the Company’s remuneration principles and incentive plans, in preparing the remuneration proposals put forward at the AGM, in determining the remuneration of the EC and the Board and in setting and assessing the performance objectives relevant for the remuneration of the EC.
The Compensation Committee generally acts in a preparatory and advisory capacity while the Board retains the decision-making authority on remuneration matters, except for the MTAR of the EC and the Board, which are subject to the approval of the shareholders at the AGM.
The Compensation Committee is comprised entirely of independent Board members who are elected individually by the shareholders at the AGM, for a term of office of one year ending after completion of the next AGM. Further details on the Compensation Committee’s composition, responsibilities and activities are provided in the Corporate Governance Report.
The Compensation Committee is comprised of three Board members for the period AGM 2021 to AGM 2022: Didier Lamouche, Kathleen Taylor and Rachel Duan. Didier Lamouche has served as a member since 2011 and as the Chair of the Compensation Committee since 2020. Kathleen Taylor has served as a member since 2015 and Rachel Duan joined as a member from AGM 2021. Jean-Christophe Deslarzes, the Chair of the Board, is a permanent invitee and participates in the Compensation Committee’s meetings as a guest without voting rights.
The CEO, the Chief Human Resources Officer and the Group SVP Total Rewards usually attend the Compensation Committee meetings. The Chair of the Compensation Committee may decide to invite other executives, as appropriate. Members of management do not participate in Compensation Committee meetings when their own individual remuneration matters are discussed.
The Compensation Committee meets as often as business requires, but at least six times a year. In 2021, the Compensation Committee held 13 meetings. The Chair of the Compensation Committee 88 Annual Report 2021


participates in at least two planning meetings prior to each Compensation Committee meeting. Details on meeting attendance of the individual Compensation Committee members are provided in the Corporate Governance Report.
The Chair of the Compensation Committee reports to the full Board after each Compensation Committee meeting. The minutes and the materials of the meetings are available to all members of the Board.
2.4 Role of external advisors. 
The Compensation Committee may decide to consult external advisors, mandated by management, from time to time for specific remuneration matters. In 2021, the Compensation Committee retained Willis Towers Watson, an international independent external consultant, to provide compensation benchmark data, and Obermatt, an independent Swiss financial research firm, to calculate the achievement and vesting level under the LTIP. These consultants’ independence and performance are reviewed periodically by the Compensation Committee to determine whether to renew or rotate the advisors. In 2021, Willis Towers Watson also provided compensation benchmark data for the broader employee population, but Obermatt had no other mandate with the Adecco Group.
3. Remuneration philosophy 3.1 Remuneration linked to strategy. 
The Adecco Group’s remuneration philosophy is to appropriately recognise and reward performance. It reflects the Company’s commitment to attract, motivate and retain talent in order to support the achievement of the Company’s Future@Work strategy (refer to Remuneration at a Glance). The remuneration philosophy translates into three principles that support this objective.
3.1.1 Reward for performance The STIP and LTIP seek to recognise and reward Group, Global Business Unit or customer performance. Thus, as a general rule, individual targets are not used in the incentive plans. The STIP incentivises management for achieving the annual financial targets and for attaining strategic and functional goals over a time horizon of one year, and fosters collaboration between the three Global Business Units: Adecco, LHH (Talent Solutions) and Modis.
Future@Work will further drive our financial performance through a firm commitment to deliver both growth and improved margins in order to provide attractive returns to our shareholders. The short-term and long-term performance measures driving remuneration and their link to our three strategic priorities is presented in section 4.
3.1.2 Alignment to shareholder’s interests The LTIP is delivered in the form of share-based remuneration and thus aligns the interests of management with those of shareholders. The LTIP incentivises management to drive long-term financial productivity and generate strong cash flow to support the transformation of the business, grow market share and generate long-term value for shareholders.
Furthermore, based on the shareholding guideline, EC members are required to hold a minimum number of Adecco Group AG shares which encourages an owner-manager culture.
3.1.3 Internal fairness and external competitiveness Total remuneration is reviewed periodically to ensure competitiveness in attracting and retaining talent while maintaining internal equity. Base salaries are generally set at the median level of the relevant function in the reference market, which is either local, regional or global. Internal equity is also taken into consideration to help create a fair working environment. Final compensation reflects the specific skills and responsibilities required for a role and the experience of the individual. Local benefits are defined in line with local regulations and competitive practice.
3.2 Approach to remuneration-setting. 
The Board reviews the individual remuneration levels of the CEO, the other EC members and its own members periodically. The Compensation Committee reviews the remuneration of the CEO and other EC members prior to submission to the Board. Remuneration is looked at in comparison to the relevant remuneration levels of similar positions at external peer companies (refer to section 3.3), leveraging data provided by an external, specialised company. The remuneration of EC members and Board members is reviewed by the Compensation Committee against relevant benchmark data on a biennial basis.
During all these reviews, the Board focuses on the specific needs of the business, affordability for the Company and the individual’s profile (i.e. skills and experience). Individual performance and growth potential are also taken into account.
For the CEO and other EC members, the goal is to position annual base salary around the market median and target direct compensation (i.e. annual base salary, the target annual short-term incentive and the target long-term incentive) between the median and the 75th percentile in order to promote a culture of pay-forperformance and to ensure that compensation levels remain competitive. In 2021, the target direct compensation of the EC, including the CEO, ranged from 60% to 119% (2020: 63% to 119%) of the market median of the pan-European peer group.
The remuneration of Board members is set to attract and retain diverse individuals with international experience whose skills match the Company’s strategy and needs. The remuneration of individual Board members is set to be competitive against benchmark companies and to reflect the time and effort required from Board members in fulfilling their Board and Committee responsibilities as well the scope of their role for the Adecco Group.

Remuneration philosophy (continued) 3.3 Approach to peer group selection. 
Peer groups are a critical tool for assessing the appropriateness of individual remuneration levels and relative business performance. Each peer group is designed in accordance with the respective purpose and requirements. Proposing the appropriate peer groups for remuneration benchmarking and performance analysis is an important activity for the Compensation Committee. Annually, peer groups are reviewed by the Compensation Committee for substantial changes due to merger and acquisition activity and unusual fluctuations in remuneration levels. This is to ensure that the existing peer groups are still relevant. Every three to five years, the suitability and composition of each peer group, outlined in Illustration 2, are reviewed in depth to ensure that the selected peer groups continue to be meaningful and meet the criteria defined by the Compensation Committee. Finally, peer groups for the EC and the Board are set so that the Adecco Group is positioned around the market median in terms of revenue.
The remuneration of the CEO and the other EC members is benchmarked against a peer group of 34 companies which are selected from various industry groups such as business support services, retail and other general industry sectors (see Illustration 3). The Adecco Group aims to hire executives from a wide range of industries and markets. Several of the current EC members were hired from the European market. The Compensation Committee believes that in order to maintain competitiveness, it is important to benchmark EC remuneration against a representative number of Swiss and European companies. The current peer group is restricted to companies based in Europe to better reflect where the Adecco Group finds its executive talent.
The remuneration of the Board is compared to a peer group of Swiss-listed companies of similar size and complexity. In Switzerland, the Board is the ultimate supervisory and organisational body, assuming responsibility for all matters not expressly reserved to other corporate bodies. Swiss law stipulates the non-transferable, absolute duties of the Board. These duties present certain risks, joint responsibility and to a certain extent personal liability and accountability for the Company’s actions, specific to Swiss law. Therefore, the peer group for Board remuneration is composed exclusively of companies based in Switzerland due to the comparability of Swiss legal requirements, including individual and joint liabilities under Swiss law.
Finally, financial performance may be assessed relative to competitors or peers. This analysis enables the Compensation Committee to measure the alignment of EC remuneration with the achievement of key financial performance indicators relative to the comparator peer groups. This is essentially applied to two metrics used in the STIP and LTIP calculations: relative revenue growth and relative total shareholder return (rTSR).
The Compensation Committee also periodically reviews the composition of its peer groups used for revenue growth and rTSR performance benchmarking. For revenue growth, the Compensation Committee believes that comparing the Adecco Group to its direct competitors, Randstad and ManpowerGroup, is in the best interests of shareholders. This is because other companies, operating in a similar industry, are not comparable in terms of size and global reach. For rTSR performance benchmarking, a shareholder view is applied in term of business similarity, investment profile and risk criteria, in order to define the peer group. In this case, company size becomes less important while business similarity and risk profile become more important.

Cash conversion ratio (CCR) ✓ 92 Annual Report 2021


4.1 Annual base salary. 
The annual base salary reflects the scope of the role and its responsibilities, the experience and skills required to perform the role and the profile of the individual in terms of their seniority and experience. The annual base salary is paid in cash, typically in monthly instalments, and serves as a reference for determining the target variable incentives.
4.2 Short-term incentive plan (STIP)
The STIP, a cash-based incentive, is based on a short-term incentive target (STI target) expressed as a percentage of the annual base salary. The STI target is linked to business performance to ensure accountability for the Adecco Group’s results. The Adecco Group uses a financial, a non-financial and an overall assessment to determine business performance over a time horizon of one year.
4.2.1 On-target opportunities The STI target is the amount paid if performance targets are met. For the CEO, the STI target corresponds to 90% of his annual base salary (2020: 80%). For the other EC members, the STI targets are in the range of 50% to 85% of their annual base salary (2020: 75% to 85%). The CEO received an STI target increase from 80% to 90% to bring his STI target closer to external market practice in 2021.
Achievement may exceed performance targets. The amount paid if achievement exceeds performance targets is capped at 150% of the STI target. For the CEO, a 150% STI cap corresponds to an STI payout equal to 135% (2020: 120%) of his annual base salary. For the other EC members, the STI cap corresponds to an STI payout in the range of 75% to 128% (2020: 113% to 128%) of their annual base salary. The Articles of Incorporation limit the STI amount paid in percentage terms of annual base salary for the CEO and other EC members (refer to section 2.2).
4.2.2 Performance measures The CEO and each EC member receive a STIP balanced scorecard containing financial and non-financial objectives (refer to Illustration 5). Each EC member’s STIP balanced scorecard is composed of financial objectives (weight: 70%) and non-financial strategic and functional objectives (weight: 30%). The selection and weight of individual financial and non-financial objectives depends on the role of the EC member (refer to Illustration 6). Financial objectives are related to the Group, Global Business Unit or customer financial performance. Geographical financial performance has been replaced by Global Business Unit and customer financial performance to support our Future@Work strategic priorities. An additive performance mechanism replaced the two-dimensional performance matrix in 2021 to help further incentivise financial performance. In the new design, relative revenue growth and EBITA margin remain pivotal features. Relative revenue growth and EBITA margin like all financial (and non-financial) metrics are now independently measured against targets to determine overall performance.
Strategic objectives include performance goals encompassing the “social factor” in environmental, social and governance standards (refer to section 4.3). Functional objectives are related to the EC member’s area of responsibility. The number of strategic and functional metrics is limited to three each with the aim of supporting collective goals amongst the EC as the Company continues its transformation journey.
Current achievement versus target is described for 2021 (refer to Illustration 6). Backward-looking and forward-looking financial targets are considered commercially sensitive and therefore, are not disclosed.
4.2.3 Target setting Financial targets are set at the beginning of each financial year and aligned with the overall budget approved by the Board. Nonfinancial strategic and functional targets are aligned with the most important priorities in any performance year.
4.2.4 Annual bonus payout For each performance objective, a target level of performance is determined, which represents the expected performance (target), as well as a minimum level of performance (baseline), below which the payout is 0%, and a maximum level of performance (cap) above which the payout is capped at 150%. The targets are set as a function of the Company’s goals (as approved by the Board), business environment, tactical focus and yearly milestones in the context of the Future@Work strategic plan. While actual performance could exceed the maximum defined in the STIP, payout is capped at 150%.
A 100% total payout is obtained when each objective is achieved at target level. A total payout of 150% requires an achievement at or above the maximum level on all objectives. An achievement level below the baseline on all objectives results in a 0% payout.
Each performance objective is measured independently and carries a specific weight in the overall payout. For example, if one performance objective with 10% weighting in the STIP balanced scorecard is at target level (i.e. 100% payout), then the overall payout on this element is 10% (10% x 100% = 10%). If all performance objectives are achieved at target then the overall payout is 100%.
Illustration 4: Actual STIP payout calculation. 
Annual base salary. 
X STI target (% of annual base salary)
X Overall achievement (%)
Actual STIP payout. 
The Board, upon recommendation of the Compensation Committee, retains discretion to adjust STIP payouts (positively and negatively) in the case of extraordinary events or developments. This allows for special situations that were not sufficiently factored into the targets to be taken into account. However, this does not include generally unfavourable market developments.
Discretion is bound by the limits defined in the Articles of Incorporation. Downward discretion of 29% was applied by the Board on the 2021 STIP payout of one EC member in a holistic assessment of underlying financial performance compared to targets set at the beginning of the year.
The STIP includes malus as well as claw-back provisions in the event of fraudulent behaviour or other types of intentional misconduct.
2021 STIP balanced scorecard This section presents the STIP balanced scorecard for the CEO and the other EC members and highlights the performance objectives. The Board follows a robust process to select appropriate KPIs and set financial targets. In addition to the financial targets, each EC member has three strategic and functional targets, nearly all of which are related to the Adecco Group’s environmental, social and governance (ESG) priorities.

REMUNERATION REPORT. 
Executive Committee’s remuneration (continued)
To chart a clear path forward and ensure continued progress against our ambitions and agreed objectives, we have identified the most immediate drivers that will help determine success for each sustainability goal. For each such metric, in turn, we have set short-term (one year) and medium-term (2025) targets. In select cases we have also confirmed long-term (2030) targets (i.e. number of people up/reskilled, gender parity and carbon reductions), in line with public commitments. This data is consolidated in our ESG Scorecard. Most of these metrics are also reflected in the Group, Global Business Unit and/or Group Function Scorecards, allocating responsibility for implementation at source and underscoring our integrated approach to addressing ESG-related issues.
Complementing this and to ensure an additional layer of accountability for key priorities, the STIP balanced scorecard for EC members also contains performance objectives that are related to select ESG measures of the Group, in addition to the core financial, strategic and functional goals. Achievement versus target is available in Illustration 6. Given the sensitive nature of some of these targets, particularly those that pertain to our core business, the ESG Scorecard as such is not made public. However, we remain committed to continuously strengthening what we measure and will continue to disclose in line with evolving expectations.

Executive Committee’s remuneration (continued)
REMUNERATION REPORT 4.4 Long-term incentive plan (LTIP)
The purpose of the LTIP is to reward long-term value creation and to enhance alignment of the interests of EC members with those of shareholders. The LTIP is a performance-based share plan providing for conditional rights to receive a certain number of Adecco Group AG shares after a three-year cliff vesting period, subject to fulfilling the performance conditions and upon continued employment of the participant at the vesting date.
For the grant awarded in 2021, the performance period started on 1 January 2021 and ends on 31 December 2023.
4.4.1 2019-2021 LTIP performance cycle The 2019 LTIP award is subject to rTSR performance of the Adecco Group compared to its peers (refer to Illustration 2). The percentile ranking of the Adecco Group TSR against the peer group is measured at the end of each year of the three-year performance period. The annual percentile ranking determines the achievement level for that year.
At the end of the performance period, the average achievement level over the three-year performance period is calculated to determine the overall vesting level for the award.
Illustration 7 presents the annual ranking achievements, corresponding annual achievement levels and overall vesting level based on the average annual performance for the 2019 LTIP award.
Illustration 7: Final vesting 2019 LTIP award. 
Year Percentile Achievement (as a % of target) 2019 64.7 69.4% 2020 58.8 57.6% 2021 0.0 0.0% Overall vesting level 42.3%
For the 2019 LTIP award vesting in 2022 (LTIP 2019–2021), the vesting level was 42.3% considering the Adecco Group TSR performance against the peer group. Therefore, out of the 141,117 performance share units (PSUs) granted in 2019 to the current EC members (including the CEO), 59,696 have vested, with an estimated vesting value of CHF 2.8 million based on the share price at year end 2021. Illustration 8 presents the historical annual overall vesting level (as a % of target).

Numbers will be available after the end of the performance period (refer to section 4.5.1).
4.4.2 2021 LTIP improvements Throughout 2020, the Compensation Committee carefully evaluated the effectiveness of the LTIP in helping drive the Company’s financial goals for the Future@Work strategic cycle. In deciding on refinements to the LTIP for 2021, feedback from shareholders and our external compensation advisors, as well as the evolving environment in which the Company operates, have been taken into account. The Board, upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, decided to amend the performance criteria to strengthen the link between the Future@Work strategy, performance and pay.
From 2021, in addition to rTSR, the LTIP contains two additional performance metrics: return on invested capital (ROIC) and cash conversion ratio (CCR), to align more effectively the long-term financial performance objectives of the EC with the Future@Work strategy. All three metrics are equally weighted at 33.3%. While rTSR remains part of the LTIP for 2021, the addition of ROIC will help drive long-term financial productivity and CCR will incentivise strong cash flow to support the transformation of the business, grow market share and generate long-term value for shareholders.
4.4.3 LTIP structure and general conditions The formula to determine the number of PSUs to be granted is as follows:
Illustration 9: Calculation formula. 
STEP 1. 
Annual base salary (CHF) x LTI target (%) = LTI target value at Grant (CHF)
STEP 2. 
LTI target value at Grant (CHF)/20-TD average share price (CHF) = Target number of PSUs at Grant. 
The average share price is calculated as the arithmetic mean of daily closing share prices 20 trading days (20-TD) prior to the grant in March each year. The 2021 grant was awarded on 31 March and the period of 20-TD selected for the final calculation was from 3 March 2021 to 30 March 2021. The resulting average share price was CHF 63.15.
At the grant date, the LTI target amounts to 130% of the annual base salary for the CEO (2020: 130%) and ranges from 75% to 100% for the other EC members (2020: 75% to 100%).
On the CEO’s appointment in 2015, the Board established his compensation initially below that of his predecessor and below market. The LTI target was then gradually increased to 130% in 2019. The Board decided not to further increase the LTI target in 2021 for the CEO.
Company shares vested under the 2021 LTIP plan are subject to an additional two-year blocking period. In 2022, the blocking period is reduced from two years to one year for any new grants made from March 2022 onwards for all LTIP participants (apart from the CEO who remains at two years). Refer to section 6 for more details on this amendment to the LTIP conditions.
The plan foresees that those participants who, before the end of the performance period, terminate their employment with the Company of their own volition, and those who receive notice of termination for cause, will no longer be entitled to the vesting of awards made under the LTIP. In case of termination by the employer without cause, a time-weighted pro-rata portion of the unvested performance share awards will vest at the regular vesting date in accordance with the level of target achievement.
In line with the Articles of Incorporation and as specified in the LTIP plan rules, in the case of a predefined Change of Control before an award under the LTIP has vested, the time-weighted pro-rata portion of the unvested performance share award may vest on the Change of Control date depending on the level of target achievement at the date of the relevant corporate event, as determined by the Compensation Committee.
The LTIP includes claw-back provisions for any award or any benefit received or entitled to be received in the case of fraudulent behaviour or other types of intentional misconduct. Performance share awards that do not vest due to lack of fulfilment of the performance conditions lapse immediately. The LTIP plan rules are subject to the applicable law in the given country of employment. The CEO and the other EC members may not use personal investment strategies to undermine or hedge the risk alignment effects of unvested deferred remuneration or any vested shares subject to the blocking period.

ROIC 33.3% ROIC measures the Group’s ability to efficiently use invested capital. ROIC is a non-US GAAP measure and is calculated as the rolling four quarter EBITA excluding one-offs divided by the average invested capital. The ROIC target, threshold and cap have been set with careful reference to historical annual and forecasted ROIC achievements.
Vesting is based on a linear payout curve from 0% to 200%. If the threshold is met, vesting (as a % of target) is equal to 40%. At target, vesting (as a % of target) is equal to 100% and if the target is exceeded, the vesting can be up to a maximum of 200%.
To determine the final vesting outcome, ROIC would be calculated based on the average of the three annual outcomes in the performance period (as at 31 December).
CCR 33.3% Cash conversion measures how effectively profits are converted into cash flow. Cash conversion is a non-US GAAP measure and is calculated as free cash flow before interest and tax paid divided by EBITA excluding one-offs. The CCR target, threshold and cap have been set with careful reference to historical annual and forecasted CCR achievements.
Vesting is based on a linear payout curve from 0% to 200%. If the threshold is met, vesting (as a % of target) is equal to 40%. At target, vesting (as a % of target) is equal to 100% and if the target is exceeded, the vesting can be up to a maximum of 200%.
To determine the final vesting outcome, CCR would be calculated based on the average of the three annual outcomes in the performance period (as at 31 December).

4.5 LTIP performance conditions. 
The vesting is capped at 200% (as a % of target) for all performance metrics.
For rTSR, the achievement and the vesting level are calculated by Obermatt (refer to section 2.4). The TSR calculation, provided by Obermatt, is based on a one-month average share price before the start and end of the overall three-year period for both Adecco Group’s TSR and its peers’ TSR, taking into consideration dividends for the period under review. Pay is linked to performance with vesting percentages increasing relative to the Adecco Group’s rank amongst its peers. The Adecco Group continues to allow gradual vesting as this helps to dissuade participants from taking excessive risks.
For ROIC and CCR, the achievement and vesting levels are calculated internally based on the actual audited financial results as at 31 December.
4.5.1 Interim update regarding ongoing LTIP cycles. 
The calculation methodology for rTSR performance is based on a point-to-point assessment, with a comparison of the one-month average share price before the start and the end of the overall three-year performance period for both the Adecco Group and the peers. Therefore, the final rTSR achievement remains open until the end of the performance period. Interim rTSR results provide an estimate of the vesting outcome by measuring the difference between the one-month average share price before the start of the overall three-year performance period and the end of the current performance year.
Final ROIC and CCR achievements are based on the average annual performance of these metrics over the three-year performance period. Therefore, annual ROIC and CCR outcomes are locked in at the end of each performance year. The final vesting percentages for ROIC and CCR components are only determined at the end of the overall three-year performance period once the final annual outcome is confirmed.
Below the interim performance against the stretch targets is reported for the ongoing LTIP cycles.
2020-2022 LTIP award rTSR was chosen as the key performance metric for the 2020-2022 LTIP performance cycle because it remains an appropriate performance metric to link the long-term remuneration of management to value creation for shareholders. At the end of 2021, rTSR for the Adecco Group is tracking below the median of its peer group. The final vesting level is determined at the end of the three-year performance period.

From 2021, in addition to rTSR, the LTIP contains two additional performance metrics: return on invested capital (ROIC) and cash conversion ratio (CCR), to align more effectively the long-term financial performance objectives of the EC with the Future@Work strategy. After the first year of the three-year LTIP performance cycle, rTSR for the Adecco Group is tracking below the median of its peer group. ROIC and CCR are tracking at target. The final vesting level is determined at the end of the three-year performance period.

As the EC is international in its nature, its members participate in the benefit plans available in the country of their employment contract. Benefits consist mainly of retirement and insurance plans that are designed to provide a reasonable level of protection for employees and their dependents in case of retirement, death or disability.
The EC members with a Swiss employment contract participate in the Adecco Group’s pension plans offered to all employees in Switzerland. In 2021, the CEO and the other EC members all had a Swiss employment contract. Pension contributions are based on the annual base salary, excluding variable cash remuneration.
EC members are also provided with certain additional benefits which could include a Company car allowance, car lease, housing allowance, relocation costs, education costs, representation allowance or health insurance. The monetary value of these other elements of remuneration is disclosed at fair value in the remuneration tables, where they are applicable.
4.7 Contractual agreements. 
The EC members have employment contracts of unlimited duration which are all subject to a notice period of up to 12 months. They are not contractually entitled to sign-on awards nor severance payments based on their individual contracts (but may be entitled to seniorityrelated payments due to foreign laws as applicable), or to Change of Control payments (for LTIP vesting see section 4.4.3). Finally, their contract may foresee non-competition provisions of up to one year post termination of their contract. As of 2021, the Group may compensate the EC member’s economic loss due to noncompetition provisions by paying monthly instalments that are 1/12 of the EC member’s annual base salary.

Remuneration and shareholding of members of the EC 5. Remuneration of members of the EC 5.1 EC membership changes in 2021. 
Ten EC members were in office on 31 December 2021, including one new EC member who joined the EC during the year. Corinne Ripoche, Enrique Sanchez and Ian Lee stepped down from their functions as EC members at the end of December 2020 and continued their employment with the Adecco Group. Ralf Weissbeck, Chief Information Officer (CIO), was appointed as an EC member in January 2021.
In determining the compensation for departing EC members, the Compensation Committee ensures that contractual entitlements as described in section 4.7 are respected and that all payments are in line with the incentive plan rules and the Swiss Ordinance against Excessive Compensation in Listed Companies.
5.2 Replacement awards. 
When an individual forfeits compensation at a former company as a result of joining the Adecco Group, the Board may offer replacement awards on a comparable basis to mirror the value of compensation forfeited. Restricted share units (RSUs) are awarded to replace share-based awards forfeited and due to vest within 12 months of their employment start date at the Adecco Group. In all other cases, PSUs are awarded to replace share-based awards forfeited. The Board aims to compensate with what is required to match the economic value of awards forfeited by the individual, taking into account relevant factors. These relevant factors include the replacement award vehicle (i.e. cash, RSUs or PSUs), whether the forfeited award is contingent on meeting performance conditions or not, the expected value of the forfeited award, the timing of forfeiture and the termination conditions.
One newly appointed EC member was granted a replacement award in the form of PSUs and RSUs to replace forfeited compensation at their former employer. Compensation due to vest in 2020 but forfeited upon the termination from the former company in 2020 has been replaced in RSUs and compensation due to vest from 2021 onwards has been replaced in PSUs. The first tranche of the RSUs awarded, representing 50% of RSUs granted, vested at grant in March 2021 and the remaining 50% vest in March 2022. They are not subject to a blocking period after vesting.
PSUs are subject to the same performance metric and performance period as the Adecco Group’s corresponding grants vesting in 2022 and 2023. They are subject to cliff vesting, financial performance metrics and a two-year blocking period following vesting. The level of awards is detailed in Illustration 12.
Should employment terminate prior to vesting, vesting of awards will be subject to the terms and conditions described in the LTIP plan rules.
Illustration 12: Replacement awards. 
Replacement awards Vesting period Blocking period Total grant value (CHF) 28,137 PSUs 2021-2023 Two-years 995,832 3,425 RSUs 2021-2022 213,608 Total 1,209,440 5.3 EC remuneration for the financial year 2021. 
In 2021, EC members’ total remuneration amounted to CHF 22.9 million (2020: CHF 18.1 million). This amount consisted of base salaries of CHF 7.0 million (2020: CHF 7.2 million), short-term incentives of CHF 5.9 million (2020: CHF 3.1 million), long-term incentives of CHF 7.2 million (2020: CHF 5.1 million), other remuneration of CHF 0.6 million (2020: CHF 0.8 million) and social contributions of CHF 2.2 million (2020: CHF 1.9 million). EC members’ total remuneration increased by 26.9% compared to 2020. Looking at the different components, the following elements can be noted:
The total amount paid as base salary in 2021 decreased by 3.1% compared to the amount of base salary paid in 2020. This is mainly due to the lower number of active EC members in 2021 compared to 2020.
In 2021, the STIP payout for the CEO was 98.8% of target (2020: 47.3%) and ranged from 78.0% to 119.4% for the other EC members (2020: 38% to 53%), giving an average of 101.9% for the entire EC including the CEO (2020: less than 50%).
Share awards granted in 2021 amount to CHF 7.2 million compared to CHF 5.1 million in 2020. This increase is driven by a higher value at grant per share in 2021 (CHF 49.68) compared to 2020 (CHF 26.85) and minor, one-off grants awarded to select members of the EC in 2021 for outstanding performance in 2020 (awarded as part of the 2021 LTIP grant).
For the CEO, his actual direct cash compensation was 99.4% of his target direct cash compensation (see Illustration 13).
For the financial year 2021, the total variable component (annual bonus and share awards at grant value) represented 57.4% of the total remuneration of the EC (2020: 45%) and 188.3% of the base salary (2020: 114%).
This is aligned with the pay-for-performance philosophy of the Adecco Group and reflects the alignment of remuneration plans to shareholders’ interests.
At the AGM of 16 April 2020, shareholders approved an MTAR of CHF 35 million for the financial year 2021. The total remuneration paid to the EC, including remuneration of former members (see Illustration 14), for this term was CHF 23.5 million and is therefore within the approved limits.
Payments made to former members in 2021 amount to CHF 0.6 million compared to CHF 0.5 million in 2020.
Remuneration paid to former EC members in 2021 is slightly higher than remuneration paid to former EC members in 2020. Remuneration paid to former EC members in 2021 comprises remuneration paid to one EC member who stepped down in 2020 while remuneration paid to former EC members in 2020 covered remuneration to two EC members for six months each in accordance with their respective termination agreements.

Valuation of the share awards granted on 31 March 2021 (2020: 16 March 2020): • The grant date values of the PSU awards are calculated based on the closing price of the Adecco Group AG share on the day of grant multiplied by the respective probability factors. These factors reflect the likelihood that the respective rTSR, ROIC and CCR (rTSR only in 2020) targets will be met at the end of the performance period. For 2021, the probability factor for rTSR, ROIC and CCR combined is 99.7% (2020: 101.4%). The probability factor for the rTSR component of the PSU awards has been determined using a Monte Carlo simulation, whereas for ROIC and CCR the estimation is based on the distribution of potential performance outcomes forecasted by the Adecco Group based on historical data and the business outlook at the time targets are set. A discount of 12% is applied which takes into consideration that PSU awards are not entitled to dividends during the vesting period, and an additional discount of 11% is applied to take into account the two-year post-vesting restriction. The per share value of PSU awards granted in 2021 amounts to CHF 49.68 (2020: CHF 26.85). 7 Replacement award granted on 31 March 2021 to one EC member comprised 3,425 RSUs and 28,137 PSUs. The PSUs are subject to the same performance metric and period as Adecco’s 2019 LTIP grant (22,590 PSUs) and 2020 LTIP grant (5,547 PSUs). • The grant date value of the RSU award is calculated based on the closing price of the Adecco Group AG share on the day of grant. A discount of 2% is applied to take into consideration that the RSU award is not entitled to dividends during the one-year vesting period. The per share value of the RSU awards granted in 2021 amounts to CHF 62.37. • For 22,590 PSUs linked to the 2019 LTIP performance metric, the probability factor on the day of grant is 55.4%. A discount of 4% is applied which takes into consideration that PSU awards are not entitled to dividends during the vesting period, and an additional discount of 11% is applied to take into account the two-year post-vesting restriction. The per share value of PSU awards granted in 2021 subject to the same performance metric and performance period as the 2019 LTIP grant is CHF 30.12. • For 5,547 PSUs linked to the 2020 LTIP performance metric, the probability factor on the day of grant is 109.1%. A discount of 8% is applied which takes into consideration that PSU awards are not entitled to dividends during the vesting period, and an additional discount of 11% is applied to take into account the two-year post-vesting restriction. The per share value of PSU awards granted in 2021 subject to the same performance metric and performance period as the 2020 LTIP grant is CHF 56.85.
102 Annual Report 2021


Outlook 2022 6. Outlook 2022. 
The EC remuneration system is reviewed by the Compensation Committee on a regular basis to ensure alignment with strategic business objectives, the external market and best practice in compensation design. Throughout 2021, the Compensation Committee carefully evaluated the effectiveness of the current variable incentive plans in helping drive the Company’s financial and non-financial goals for the Future@Work strategic cycle. A series of roadshows were organised in November 2021 to meet shareholders and engage them in constructive dialogue, and to respond to their interests concerning executive remuneration. In deciding on refinements to the existing variable programmes for 2022, feedback received from shareholders, proxy advisors and our external compensation advisors as well as the evolving environment in which the Company operates have been taken into account. The following table outlines key changes to the design of the variable incentive plans for 2022:
Variable incentive plan Outlook 2022. 
Annual STIP The STIP design will remain largely unchanged for 2022. The financial, strategic and functional KPIs will remain largely aligned with the KPIs set for 2021, established at the start of the Future@Work strategic cycle.
To reflect the Adecco Group’s new objective to successfully integrate AKKA, deliver 2022 cost savings and mitigate key risks (e.g. talent retention measures), a new KPI will be added to the 2022 STIP balanced scorecard for the CEO, the CFO, the CHRO, the CIO and the President of Akkodis, the new Global Business Unit formed by uniting AKKA and Modis on 24 February 2022.
The final 2022 STIP balanced scorecard for the CEO and other EC members will be shared in 2023 (refer to Illustration 6 for the 2021 STIP balanced scorecard).
LTIP The LTIP design will remain unchanged for 2022. The LTIP design for EC members will continue to include three equally-weighted financial performance metrics: relative total shareholder return (rTSR), return on invested capital (ROIC) and cash conversion ratio (CCR). These financial performance metrics continue to align to the strategic long-term financial performance objectives of the Adecco Group.
As noted above, and to better align with current market practice, the CEO is now required to hold a minimum of 60,000 (2020: 40,000, i.e. a 50% increase) Adecco Group AG shares. Other EC members must hold 15,000 (2020: 10,000) Adecco Group AG shares within five years from the date of the March 2022 annual grant. This new shareholding requirement is approximately equal to 250% (2021: 160%) of the annual base salary of the CEO and 150% (2021: 100%) of the annual base salary of other EC members on average. The increase in shareholding levels has been balanced with an adjustment to the LTIP plan duration from five years to four years by reducing the blocking period from two years to one year, on a go-forward basis only (apart from the CEO who remains at two years). This reduction of the blocking period from two years to one year for all other EC members and non-EC LTIP participants has been decided considering the significant turnover seen following the Covid-19 crisis, especially where the use of a blocking period is not common market practice. By reducing the blocking period for LTIP participants the LTIP is even more attractive and effective at retaining and attracting talent. The blocking period for the CEO will remain at two years but subject to a regular review.
The Compensation Committee considered that the increase in shareholding levels further strengthens long-term thinking and behaviour amongst the EC members. Should the level of shareholding not be met within five years, the sale of any shares held by the EC member (including those recently received via the LTIP) is prohibited until the holding requirement is fulfilled. If the shareholding guideline is not reached within five years, the Board may decide to either extend the blocking period of the shares already vested until the required level is met or require EC members to purchase shares from the market.

REMUNERATION REPORT 7. Remuneration of the Board of Directors 7.1 Remuneration system. 
The remuneration system for the Board of Directors is unchanged compared to 2020 and has remained consistent for seven years. To ensure independence in exercising their supervisory duties over executive management, the members of the Board receive fixed remuneration for their term of office without entitlement to variable remuneration. Two thirds of the Board fee is paid in cash and one third is paid in shares subject to a three-year blocking period. The blocking period supports the alignment of Board members’ interests with those of shareholders.
The remuneration in cash is paid out quarterly (for the Chair of the Board: monthly) and is subject to regular contributions to social security where applicable. The shares are transferred on a quarterly basis. Board members are not insured under the Company retirement plans.
When determining the individual Board members’ remuneration, their various functions and responsibilities within the Board and its Committees are taken into consideration. The remuneration levels for the term of office from AGM 2021 to AGM 2022 are summarised in Illustration 15.
Remuneration of the Board of Directors 7.2 Outlook for the term from AGM 2022 to AGM 2023. 
For the term from AGM 2022 to AGM 2023, it is anticipated that the remuneration structure for the Board will remain the same as for the term from AGM 2021 to AGM 2022.
7.3 Remuneration of the Board of Directors for 2021 and shareholdings as at 31 December 2021. 
For the amounts paid to the individual members of the Board in the period under review (1 January 2021 to 31 December 2021), refer to Illustration 16.
In 2021, the Board’s total remuneration amounted to CHF 4.71 million (2020: CHF 4.58 million). Of this total, CHF 2.91 million was paid out in cash (2020: CHF 2.82 million), CHF 1.48 million was awarded in restricted shares (2020: CHF 1.43 million) and social contributions amounted to CHF 0.32 million (2020: CHF 0.32 million). While the remuneration structure (annual Board fee and Committee fees) remained unchanged, the total Board remuneration increased slightly (excluding social contributions) compared to the last year. This is solely due to the composition of the Board in 2021 versus 2020 as there was no increase to fees for the Board compared to the prior year.
At the AGM of 16 April 2020, shareholders approved an MTAR of CHF 5.1 million for the Board for the term from AGM 2020 to AGM 2021. The remuneration paid to the Board for that term was CHF 4.71 million and is therefore within the approved limits.
At the AGM of 8 April 2021, shareholders approved an MTAR of CHF 5.1 million for the Board for the term from AGM 2021 until AGM 2022. The remuneration paid to the Board for this ongoing term is anticipated to be approximately CHF 4.9 million. The final amount will be disclosed in the Remuneration Report 2022.

The consolidated financial statements include Adecco Group AG, a Swiss corporation, its consolidated subsidiaries, as well as variable interest entities in which the Adecco Group is considered the primary beneficiary (collectively, the Company). The Company’s principal business is providing human resource services including Flexible Placement, Permanent Placement, Career Transition, Outsourcing, Consulting & Other Services, and Training, Up-skilling & Re-skilling services to businesses and organisations throughout Europe, North America, Asia Pacific, South America, and North Africa. At the end of 2021, the Company’s worldwide network consists of approximately 4,300 branches and approximately 33,000 full-time equivalent (FTE) employees in 59 countries and territories.
As part of the new strategic programme Future@Work, the Company realigned its business along three distinct Global Business Units (GBU): Adecco, LHH (Talent Solutions) and Modis. Effective 1 January 2021, the Company updated its primary segment reporting to align with the corresponding changes in Executive Committee responsibilities.
As a result of this change, the primary segment reporting transitioned to a brand-driven organisational model structured around solutions-based business groups comprising Adecco (further split by geography: France; Northern Europe; DACH; Southern Europe & EEMENA; Americas; and APAC), LHH (Talent Solutions) and Modis. The structure is complemented by secondary segment reporting of the Company’s service lines (comprising Flexible Placement; Permanent Placement; Career Transition; Outsourcing, Consulting & Other Services; and Training, Up-skilling & Re-skilling).
Basis of presentation The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with US generally accepted accounting principles (US GAAP) and the provisions of Swiss law.
Reporting currency. 
The reporting currency of the Company is the Euro, which reflects the significance of the Company’s Euro-denominated operations. Adecco Group AG’s share capital is denominated in Swiss Francs and the Company declares and pays dividends in Swiss Francs.
Foreign currency translation The Company’s operations are conducted in various countries around the world and the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are reported in the applicable foreign currencies (functional currencies). Financial information is translated from the applicable functional currency to the Euro, the reporting currency, for inclusion in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Income, expenses, and cash flows are translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the fiscal year or at transaction exchange rates, and assets and liabilities are translated at fiscal year-end exchange rates. Resulting translation adjustments are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss), net, in shareholders’ equity. Exchange gains and losses on intercompany balances that are considered permanently invested are also included in equity.
Hyperinflationary economies Local subsidiaries in hyperinflationary economies are required to use the Euro as their functional currency and remeasure the monetary assets and liabilities not denominated in Euro using the applicable rate in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 830, “Foreign Currency Matters” (ASC 830). All exchange gains and losses resulting from remeasurement are recognised in net income.
Principles of consolidation. 
The consolidated financial statements include 100% of the assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, income, loss, and cash flows of Adecco Group AG, its consolidated subsidiaries and entities for which the Company has been determined to be the primary beneficiary under ASC 810, “Consolidation” (ASC 810). As of 31 December 2021, the consolidated subsidiaries include all majority-owned subsidiaries of the Company. Noncontrolling interests for entities fully consolidated but not wholly owned by the Company are accounted for in accordance with ASC 810 and are reported as a component of equity. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.
The Company accounts for variable interest entities (VIEs) in accordance with ASC 810, which requires the consolidation of a VIE in which an entity is considered the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the enterprise that has both the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. An entity is required to perform a qualitative and a quantitative analysis to determine whether it has a controlling financial interest in a VIE.
Investments. 
The Company records investments in affiliates over which it is able to exercise significant influence using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting, investments are recorded at cost and are subsequently increased or reduced to reflect the Company’s share of income or losses of the investee. The proportionate share of earnings is presented within “Other income/(expenses), net”, unless the investee is considered integral to the Company’s operations, in which case the proportionate share of earnings is presented as a separate component of operating income on the face of the consolidated statements of operations. Profits on transactions with equity affiliates are eliminated to the extent of the Company’s ownership in the investee. Dividends from equity method investees are reflected as reductions of the carrying values of the applicable investments.
The cost method of accounting is applied for investments in entities which do not have readily determinable fair values and over which the Company is not able to exercise significant influence (generally investments in which the Company’s ownership is less than 20%).
116 Annual Report 2021


Annual Report 2021 121. 
Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make judgements, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to allowance for doubtful accounts, accruals and provisions, impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, contingencies, pension accruals, and income taxes. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other marketspecific assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Due to the continuing effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and related government response measures there is currently a higher degree of uncertainty in making the judgements, assumptions and estimates required in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Given the dynamic nature of these circumstances, more frequent and potentially more significant reassessments and adjustments to estimates in future periods may occur. The results of management’s estimates form the basis for making judgements about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from those estimates.
Recognition of revenues The Company generates revenues from sales of Flexible Placement services, Permanent Placement services, Career Transition services, Outsourcing, Consulting & Other Services and Training, Up-skilling & Re-skilling services. Refer to Note 2 for further details.
Marketing expenses Marketing expenses totalled EUR 104, EUR 88 and EUR 105 in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. These costs are included in selling, general, and administrative expenses (SG&A) and are generally expensed as incurred.
Government subsidies and grants. 
Government subsidies and grants are recognised when it is probable that the Company will comply with the respective qualifying conditions set forth by the grantor. Government subsidies and grants earned, which are intended to compensate for expenses incurred, are recorded net against the related expenses in the same period in which those expenses are incurred.
Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid instruments having an original maturity at the date of purchase of three months or less.
The Company’s policy is to invest excess funds primarily in investments with maturities of 12 months or less, and in money market and fixed income funds with sound credit ratings, limited market risk, and high liquidity.
Restricted cash balances generally consist of deposits made in connection with lease/rent agreements and other refundable deposits, legal claims, cash received from customers but owed to subcontractors, cash subsidies (mainly related to governmental financial supporting programmes) received from authorities but owed to third parties, and funds set aside in connection with outstanding options and warrants arising from acquisitions.
Trade accounts receivable. 
Trade accounts receivable are recorded at net realisable value after deducting an allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company makes judgements on an entity-by-entity basis as to its ability to collect outstanding receivables and provides an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a specific review of significant outstanding invoices. For those invoices not specifically reviewed, provisions are provided at differing percentages based on the age of the receivable. In determining these percentages, the Company analyses its historical collection experience and current economic trends. Where available and when cost effective, the Company utilises credit insurance. Accounts receivable balances are written-off when the Company determines that it is unlikely that future remittances will be received, or as permitted by local law.
Property, equipment, and leasehold improvements Property and equipment are carried at historical cost and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives (generally three to ten years for furniture, fixtures, and office equipment; three to five years for computer equipment and software; and 20 to 40 years for buildings). Leasehold improvements are stated at cost and are depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the improvement or the remaining lease term, which includes the expected lease renewal. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.

Capitalised software costs. 
The Company capitalises purchased software as well as internally developed software. Internal and external costs incurred to develop internal use software during the application development stage are capitalised. Application development stage costs generally include software configuration, coding, installation, and testing. Costs incurred for maintenance, testing minor upgrades, and minor enhancements are expensed as incurred. Capitalised software costs are included in property, equipment, and leasehold improvements, net. Capitalised costs are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life commencing once the software is ready for its intended use, generally three to five years.
Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired less liabilities assumed. We complete our final assessments of the fair value of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities and our final evaluations of uncertain tax positions and contingencies within one year of the acquisition date. In accordance with ASC 350, “Intangibles – Goodwill and Other” (ASC 350), goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortised. Rather, the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets is tested annually for impairment.
Goodwill is tested on a reporting unit level using a quantitative impairment test. Reporting units may be operating segments as a whole or an operation one level below an operating segment, referred to as a component. The carrying value of each reporting unit is compared to the reporting unit’s fair value as determined using a combination of comparable market multiples, additional market information, and discounted cash flow valuation models. If the fair value of the reporting unit is lower than the carrying value of the reporting unit, an impairment charge is recorded in operating income.
Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested by comparing the fair value of the asset to the carrying value of the asset. In the event that the carrying value exceeds the fair value, an impairment charge is recorded in operating income.
Definite-lived intangible assets In accordance with ASC 805, “Business Combinations” (ASC 805), purchased identifiable intangible assets are capitalised at fair value as of the acquisition date. Intangible assets with definite lives, primarily marketing-related (trade names), and customer relationships, are generally amortised on a straight-line basis over the estimated period in which benefits are received, which generally ranges from one to ten years.
Impairment of long-lived assets including definite-lived intangible assets The Company evaluates long-lived assets, including intangible assets with definite lives, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with ASC 360-10-35-15, “Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets”. The asset is regarded as not recoverable if the carrying amount exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows. The impairment loss is then calculated as the difference between the asset’s carrying value and its fair value, which is calculated using a discounted cash flow model.
Accounting for restructuring costs. 
In recording severance reserves for ongoing benefits, the Company accrues a liability when the following conditions have been met: the employees’ rights to receive compensation are attributable to employees’ services already rendered; the obligation relates to rights that vest or accumulate; payment of the compensation is probable; and the amount can be reasonably estimated. For one-time termination benefits which require employees to render services beyond a “minimum retention period”, liabilities associated with employee termination benefits are recorded as employees render services over the future service period. Otherwise, liabilities associated with employee one-time termination benefits are recorded at the point when management has taken a decision to terminate a specific group of employees, the employees have been notified of the decision, and the type and amount of benefits to be received by the employees is known. Liabilities for non-lease related contract termination and other exit costs are recorded at fair value when a contract is formally terminated in accordance with the contract term, or the Company ceases using the right conveyed by the contract.
Operating leases The Company enters into operating lease contracts mainly for real estate and motor vehicles resulting in Operating lease right-of-use assets, Current operating lease liabilities and Operating lease liabilities as presented in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Operating lease right-of-use assets represent the Company’s right to use underlying assets for the lease term. Current operating lease liabilities and Operating lease liabilities represent the Company’s current and long-term obligations arising from operating lease contracts.
Non-lease components are separated from lease components for real estate lease contracts, while there is no separation between lease and nonlease components for motor vehicle lease contracts. The Company considers consideration paid in relation to separated non-lease components to already reflect the market value of the leased property and accordingly no further allocation of the lease component consideration is undertaken. The remaining lease terms of operating leases vary from one year to 12 years; some contain options to extend the lease term or to terminate the lease with a notice period. The Company considers lease and non-lease components as well as extension options to lease terms in order to establish its Operating lease right-of-use assets and the corresponding current and long-term obligations. For most of the Company’s operating leases, an implicit rate is not readily determined. To determine the present value of future lease payments at the commencement date of an operating lease contract, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate. The Company applies the incremental borrowing rate using the portfolio approach to portfolios of similar assets. The incremental borrowing rate is estimated to approximate the external interest rate for the Company and is adjusted based on the economic environment where the leased asset portfolio is located.
 118 Annual Report 2021


Annual Report 2021 123. 
Operating lease right-of-use assets are measured at the commencement date of the operating lease contract at the value of the arising operating lease obligations. Operating lease right-of-use assets are further adjusted for any lease prepayments, lease incentives received, initial direct costs, and impairment charges incurred. Payments made by the Company to settle operating lease obligations are primarily fixed; however, certain operating lease contracts contain variable payments which are determined based on variable indicators such as the Consumer Price Index, fluctuating property tax rates in a real estate lease, or the mileage consumed in a motor vehicle lease. Variable payments are expensed as incurred and are not included in the Operating lease right-of-use assets or Operating lease obligations measurement. Payments made in lease arrangements where the lease term is 12 months or less and where an option to purchase the underlying asset does not exist are similarly expensed as incurred. Operating lease expenses are recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term and recorded in the consolidated statements of operations, in Direct costs of services, or Selling, general, and administrative expenses, depending on the nature of the expenses.
Income taxes. 
The Company accounts for income taxes and uncertainty in income taxes recognised in the Company’s financial statements in accordance with ASC 740, “Income Taxes” (ASC 740). ASC 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statements recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. ASC 740 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition.
Current liabilities and assets are recognised for the estimated payable or refundable taxes on the tax returns for the current year. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and includes the future tax benefit of existing net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates and laws expected to be in effect in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. A valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets in those cases when management does not believe that the realisation is more likely than not. While management believes that its judgements and estimates regarding deferred tax assets and liabilities are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience may materially affect the Company’s future financial results.
In addition, significant judgement is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of a global business, there are many transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Many of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of intercompany transactions and arrangements. Although management believes that its tax return positions are supportable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be materially different from amounts reflected in the income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material effect on the income tax provisions or benefits in the periods in which such determinations are made.
Earnings per share In accordance with ASC 260, “Earnings per Share” (ASC 260), basic earnings/(loss) per share is computed by dividing net income/(loss) attributable to Adecco Group shareholders by the number of weighted-average shares for the fiscal year. Diluted earnings/(loss) per share reflects the maximum potential dilution that could occur if dilutive securities, such as stock options, non-vested shares or convertible debt, were exercised or converted into common shares or resulted in the issuance of common shares that would participate in net income attributable to Adecco Group shareholders.
Financial instruments In accordance with ASC 815, “Derivatives and Hedging” (ASC 815), all derivative instruments are initially recognised at fair value as either Other current assets, Other assets, Other accrued expenses, or Other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets regardless of the purpose or intent for holding the derivative instruments. The derivatives are subsequently remeasured to fair value at the end of each reporting period. For derivative instruments designated and qualifying as fair value hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments as well as the changes in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognised within the same line item in earnings. Any cash flow impact on settlement of these contracts is classified within the consolidated statements of cash flows according to the nature of the hedged item. For derivative instruments designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the changes in the fair value of derivative instruments is initially recorded as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss), net, in shareholders’ equity and reclassified into earnings in the period during which the hedged transaction impacts earnings. The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the derivative instruments is immediately recognised in earnings. The cash flow impact on settlement of these contracts is classified according to the nature of the hedged item. For derivative instruments designated and qualifying as net investment hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments are recorded as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss), net, in shareholders’ equity to the extent they are considered effective. These gains or losses will remain in equity until the related net investment is sold or otherwise disposed of. The cash flow impact on settlement of these contracts is classified as cash flows from investing activities.
For derivative instruments that are not designated or that do not qualify as hedges under ASC 815, the changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments are recognised in Other income/(expenses), net, within the consolidated statements of operations. Any cash flow impact on settlement of these contracts is classified as cash flows from investing activities.

Fair value measurement. 
The Company accounts for assets and liabilities which are required to be recorded at fair value in accordance with ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements” (ASC 820). Fair value is defined by ASC 820 as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC 820 establishes a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritises the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy requires entities to maximise the use of observable inputs and minimise the use of unobservable inputs. The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows: • Level 1 – Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
• Level 2 – Quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities, or other inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.
• Level 3 – Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets and liabilities. This includes certain pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs.
The Company measures fair value using unadjusted quoted market prices. If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based upon internally developed models that use, whenever possible, current market-based parameters, such as interest rate curves and currency exchange rates. The Company also utilises independent third-party pricing services. When appropriate, valuations are adjusted to reflect credit considerations, generally based on available market evidence.
Investments in private equity, real estate and collective funds held within our pension plans are generally valued using the net asset value (NAV) per share as a practical expedient for fair value provided certain criteria are met. The NAVs are determined based on the fair values of the underlying investments in the funds. These assets are not classified in the fair value hierarchy but are separately disclosed.
New accounting guidance In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments”. The new guidance requires the use of a “current expected credit loss” model for most financial assets. Under the new model, an entity recognises as an allowance its estimate of expected credit losses, rather than the current methodology requiring delay of recognition of credit losses until it is probable a loss has been incurred. The new guidance is effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after 15 December 2022 including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company plans to adopt this guidance as of 1 January 2023 and is currently assessing the impact of this guidance on the consolidated financial statements.
In January 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-01, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Scope” amending ASU 2020-04, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic: 848): Facilitation of the Effects of the Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting” issued in March 2020. The guidance provides temporary optional expedients and exceptions to the US GAAP guidance on contract modifications and hedge accounting to facilitate the transition away from LIBOR and other rates that are to be discontinued. The Company adopted the new guidance at the time of its publication with no significant impact. Certain outstanding cross-currency swaps and interest rate swaps that are designated as cash flow hedges or fair value hedges will transition to new reference rates in 2022. In 2022, the Company expects to apply the optional expedient, which permits changes in (i) the contractual terms or (ii) in the interest rate used for discounting without dedesignating the hedging relationship.
In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, “Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers”. The update requires contract assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination to be recognised and measured at the date of acquisition in accordance with the principles for recognising revenues from contracts with customers. The new guidance is effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after 15 December 2023 including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently assessing whether to early adopt this guidance and the impact of this guidance on the consolidated financial statements.
In November 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-10 “Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance”. The update requires entities to disclose certain types of government assistance. Under the update, the Company is required to annually disclose (i) the type of the assistance received, including any significant terms and conditions, (ii) its related accounting policy, and (iii) the effect such transactions have on its financial statements. The update is effective either prospectively for all in-scope transactions at the date of adoption or retrospectively, for annual periods beginning after 15 December 2021. The Company will adopt this update prospectively as of 1 January 2022. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this guidance on the consolidated financial statements.
Presentation and reclassifications Certain reclassifications have been made to prior years’ amounts or balances in order to conform to the current year presentation.
Other disclosures required by Swiss law. 
The detailed disclosures regarding the executive remuneration that are required by Swiss law are included in the Remuneration Report.

Note 2 – Revenues. 
Recognition of revenues. 
Revenues are recognised as the Company satisfies its obligations under a contract with a customer, which is when control of the promised services is transferred to the customer and in an amount that reflects the expected consideration the Company is entitled to in exchange for those services. Revenues are recognised and reported net of any sales taxes.
The following table presents the Company’s revenues disaggregated by type of service provided: in EUR 2021 2020 2019. 
Flexible Placement 17,263 16,281 19,947. 
Permanent Placement 583 406 578. 
Career Transition 314 386 349. 
Outsourcing, Consulting & Other Services 2,471 2,247 2,283. 
Training, Up-skilling & Re-skilling 318 241 270. 
Total revenues 20,949 19,561 23,427. 
In Note 19, revenues are additionally disaggregated by segment and country.
Flexible Placement Revenues related to Flexible Placement services are generally negotiated and invoiced on an hourly basis. Associates record the hours they have worked and these hours, at the rate agreed with the customer, are then accumulated and billed according to the agreed terms. Flexible Placement contract durations can range from less than one month to multiple years but generally may be terminated earlier if appropriate notice is provided. Flexible Placement service revenues are recognised over time upon rendering the services and in line with the Company’s right to invoice the customer. The Company provides Flexible Placement services in the following operating segments: Adecco France; Adecco Northern Europe; Adecco DACH; Adecco Southern Europe & EEMENA; Adecco Americas; Adecco APAC; LHH (Talent Solutions); and Modis.
Permanent Placement Revenues related to Permanent Placement services are generally recognised at the point in time the candidate begins full-time employment, or once the fee is earned and the Company has no further obligations to the customer. Allowance provisions are established based on historical information for any non-fulfilment of Permanent Placement obligations and presented in Accounts payable and accrued expenses and recorded as a reduction of revenue. The Company provides Permanent Placement services in the following operating segments: Adecco France; Adecco Northern Europe; Adecco DACH; Adecco Southern Europe & EEMENA; Adecco Americas; Adecco APAC; LHH (Talent Solutions); and Modis.
Career Transition. 
Revenues related to Career Transition are negotiated with the client on a project basis and are generally recognised over time upon rendering the services, such as consulting services where revenue is billed and recognised on an hourly basis or workshops and coaching sessions with stated fees per service. The Company also offers multi-month career transition packages or similar services in which participants are offered a range of services for a fixed price. Fees invoiced prior to providing services are deferred and recorded in Accounts payable and accrued expenses until the services are rendered. These revenues are recognised based on historical usage of offered services by the participants over the duration of service period to best depict the transfer of services to the customer. Additionally, certain contracts may contain multiple performance obligations, in which case the Company allocates revenue to each performance obligation based on the standalone selling prices, generally determined based on the prices it would charge to other customers in similar circumstances. The Company provides Career Transition services in the following operating segments: Adecco Southern Europe & EEMENA; and LHH (Talent Solutions).
Outsourcing, Consulting & Other Services Revenues related to Outsourcing, Consulting & Other Services are generally recognised over time upon rendering the services. Customers are billed through the weekly or monthly billing cycle based on information reported on timesheets multiplied by the contractual billing rate. Revenue is accrued for services which have been rendered but remain unbilled as of the reporting date. Revenues related to other services include Managed Service Programmes (MSP) and Recruitment Process Outsourcing (RPO). Other services are generally recognised over time as the services are performed in the amount to which the Company has a right to invoice. Fees invoiced prior to providing services are deferred and recorded in Accounts payable and accrued expenses until the services are rendered. The Company provides Outsourcing, Consulting & Other Services in the following operating segments: Adecco France; Adecco Northern Europe; Adecco DACH; Adecco Southern Europe & EEMENA; Adecco Americas; Adecco APAC; LHH (Talent Solutions); and Modis.

Training, Up-skilling & Re-skilling Revenues related to Training, Up-skilling & Re-skilling services are generally recognised over time upon rendering the services depending on the nature of the service contract. These service contracts include consulting services in which the Company will bill the customer at an agreed-upon rate when the services are performed. The service contracts may also include workshops or group coaching sessions for the customer’s employees as well as other talent development-related offerings, such as skills assessments or resource toolkits. The Company will bill the customer at the stated price per service or price per participant upon rendering the services. Certain contracts may include customised project work in which the Company performs a combination of consulting services, assessments, and ongoing coaching sessions. These types of contracts may contain multiple performance obligations, in which case the Company allocates revenue to each performance obligation based on the standalone selling prices, generally determined based on the prices it would charge to other customers in similar circumstances. The Company provides Training, Up-skilling & Re-skilling in the following operating segments: Adecco France; Adecco Northern Europe; Adecco Southern Europe & EEMENA; Adecco Americas; Adecco APAC; LHH (Talent Solutions); and Modis.
Principal vs agent The Company determines whether it is a principal or an agent by evaluating if it obtains control of the specified services within an arrangement. For contracts with customers in which the Company is the principal, the Company reports gross revenues and gross direct costs. Under arrangements where the Company is an agent, as is generally the case in most MSP contracts, revenues are reported on a net basis.
Discounts, rebates, and other transaction price adjustments are estimated at contract inception and recognised as reductions to sales over the duration of the contract. The Company uses historical experience to estimate these types of variable consideration and records a liability as the related revenues are recognised. The Company does not expect significant changes to its estimates of variable consideration to occur.
The Company’s payment terms in its contracts vary by type and location of its customer and the services offered. The Company’s client contracts are generally short-term in nature with a term of one year or less. The Company provides services in the normal course of business on arm’s-length terms to entities that are affiliated with certain of its officers, Board members, and significant shareholders through investment or board directorship.
Upon rendering services to its customers, the Company generally recognises its unconditional rights to consideration as receivables presented as Trade accounts receivable, net. The period between when services are performed, the customer is billed, and when payment is due is not significant.
Practical expedients and exemptions The Company does not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected duration of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which the Company recognises revenue at the amount to which it has the right to invoice for services performed. Revenues from contracts which do not meet one of these two exemptions are not significant. Revenues from long-term flexible placement and outsourcing contracts will generally be recognised over the next one to three years based on the agreed-upon rates and levels of services performed.
Additionally, the Company recognises incremental costs of obtaining a contract as an expense when incurred if the amortisation period of the contract asset would be one year or less. �
Note 3 – Acquisitions. 
The Company made acquisitions in 2021, 2020 and 2019. The Company does not consider any of its 2021, 2020 and 2019 acquisition transactions to be material, individually or in the aggregate, to its consolidated balance sheets or statements of operations.
The aggregate impact of acquisitions in 2021 and 2020 is as follows: in EUR 2021 2020. 
Impact of acquisitions. 
Net tangible assets/(liabilities) acquired (12) (3)
Identified intangible assets 67 10. 
Goodwill 106 19. 
Deferred tax assets/(liabilities), net (14)
Total consideration 147 26. 
In September 2021, the Company acquired all outstanding shares of QAPA S.A. (QAPA), which is a provider of a fully digital workforce solution in France, for a consideration of EUR 95, net of EUR 8 cash acquired. Goodwill of EUR 43 and intangible assets of EUR 60 were recorded in connection with QAPA. QAPA was consolidated by the Company as of 29 September 2021, and the results of QAPA's operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements since 29 September 2021. The goodwill arising from the acquisition consists largely of acquired technical expertise and synergies from leveraging the wholly digital workforce solution with Adecco's extensive customer network and candidates database.

Note 6 – Goodwill and intangible assets. 
The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill below have been recast to reflect the reorganisation of the Company’s operating segments in 2021, as outlined in Note 1. Management has determined that this recasting of the carrying amount of goodwill has not resulted in any indication of an impairment loss. The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the years ended 31 December 2021 and 31 December 2020 are as follows: in EUR Adecco France.

As of 31 December 2021 and 31 December 2020, the gross goodwill amounted to EUR 4,038 and EUR 3,888, respectively.
As of 31 December 2021, accumulated impairment charges amounted to EUR 1,555 of which EUR 1,406 in Adecco DACH, EUR 22 in Adecco APAC, and EUR 57 in Adecco Northern Europe, EUR 21 in LHH (Talent Solutions) and EUR 49 in Modis, impacted by fluctuations in exchange rates.
As of 31 December 2020, accumulated impairment charges amounted to EUR 1,549 of which EUR 1,405 in Adecco DACH, EUR 21 in Adecco APAC, and EUR 54 in Adecco Northern Europe, EUR 21 in LHH (Talent Solutions) and EUR 48 in Modis impacted by fluctuations in exchange rates.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may be impaired. The Company performed its annual impairment test of goodwill in the fourth quarter of 2021, 2020 and 2019, noting no indication of impairment. In March 2020, the Company performed an interim goodwill impairment test based on management’s revised five-year projections for sales and earnings and consequently recognised an impairment in Adecco DACH of EUR 362. The revision of management’s five-year projections for sales and earnings was driven by the unprecedented degree of uncertainty related to Covid-19, compounding already challenging market dynamics in Germany.
In determining the fair value of the reporting units, the Company uses expected future revenue growth rates and profit margins, and for the long-term value a long-term growth rate of maximum 2.5%. For each reporting unit, projected cash flows are discounted to their net present values. Discount rates used during the Company’s goodwill impairment tests in 2021, 2020 and 2019 ranged from 6.4% to 11.6%.
The carrying amounts of other intangible assets as of 31 December 2021 and 31 December 2020 are as follows: 31.12.2021 31.12.2020 in EUR Gross.

The Company performed its annual impairment test of indefinite-lived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of 2021, 2020 and 2019. In 2021, the brand structure within the LHH (Talent Solutions) Global Business Unit was simplified to one global brand – LHH. As a result, an impairment 124 Annual Report 2021


Annual Report 2021 129 charge of EUR 31 for the Badenoch & Clark brand (an indefinite-lived intangible asset (trade name)) was recognised. In 2021 the Company determined that there was no other indication of impairment.
The Company’s November 2020 acquisition of Hired and the resulting strategic shift of existing digital business to the acquired technological platform triggered an impairment charge of EUR 9 in relation to certain existing definite-lived intangible assets (acquired technology, contracts and trade name) in the fourth quarter of 2020.
In 2019 an impairment of intangible assets (trade names) of EUR 20 was recognised as the Company continued to streamline its brand portfolio.
The estimated future amortisation expense related to definite-lived intangible assets is EUR 66 in 2022, EUR 31 in 2023, EUR 18 in 2024 and EUR 1 in 2025. The weighted-average amortisation period for customer base intangible assets is four years.
Note 7 – Restructuring. 
In 2020, the Company initiated several restructuring plans in response to the unprecedented economic impact created by the Covid-19 pandemic.

Restructuring expenses are recorded in SG&A and mainly represent headcount reductions and branch optimisation.

Other credit facilities Committed multicurrency revolving credit facility The Company maintains a committed 5-year multicurrency revolving credit facility with two 1-year extension options, with a maturity date of April 2023 and with an initial facility of EUR 600. In March 2020, the second 1-year extension option was exercised, and the maturity date of the credit facility was extended to April 2025. In October 2021, the Company up-sized the facility from EUR 600 to EUR 900. At the same time the facility was updated to accommodate the latest IBOR amendment language. All other details remain unchanged. The facility is used for general corporate purposes including refinancing of advances and outstanding letters of credit. The interest rate is based on EURIBOR for drawings denominated in Euro, plus a margin between 0.225% and 0.55% per annum, depending on certain net debt-to-EBITDA ratios. The applicable margin levels set out above will be subject to further variation in accordance with certain “ESG Score” provisions. In addition to the interest rate costs, a utilisation fee of 0.075%, 0.15%, or 0.30% applies for total utilisation of up to 33.33%, 66.67%, and above 66.67% of the facility amount, respectively. No utilisation fee shall be payable while the facility is unutilised. The letter of credit fee equals the applicable margin, and the commitment fee equals 35% of the applicable margin. As of 31 December 2021 and 31 December 2020, there were no outstanding borrowings under the credit facility.

Note 12 – Stock-based compensation. 
As of 31 December 2021, the Company had non-vested share awards outstanding relating to its common shares. Compensation expense of EUR 21, EUR 16 and EUR 12, was recognised in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, in connection with the non-vested share awards granted in 2021, 2020, and 2019. The total income tax benefit recognised related to stock compensation amounted to EUR 3 in 2021, EUR 2 in 2020 and EUR 2 in 2019.
Non-vested share award plans Performance share awards (PSU awards) were granted in March 2021, 2020, and 2019 to the members of the Executive Committee (EC) and to a further group of senior managers (only in 2021) under the Company’s LTIP. The awards contain an undertaking to deliver a number of Adecco Group AG shares to the participants of the plan after the end of the performance period (end of performance period for the 2021, 2020, and 2019 awards on 31 December 2023, 31 December 2022, and 31 December 2021, respectively). The requisite service period represents three calendar years starting on 1 January 2021, 1 January 2020, and 1 January 2019, respectively. The delivery of the shares will be made provided and to the extent that the predefined market and performance targets are met. Those awards that do not vest due to lack of fulfilment lapse immediately.
The PSU awards granted in 2021 introduced two financial performance metrics, return on invested capital (ROIC)1 and the cash conversion ratio (CCR)2 in addition to the relative change in the Company’s shareholder value including reinvested dividends (total shareholder return (TSR)), compared to that of a predefined group of peers the Company used for the 2019 and 2020 grants (TSR awards). Each of the three metrics are equally weighted to calculate the achievement percentage.
In addition, service condition awards (restricted share unit awards (RSU awards)) were granted in 2021, 2020, and 2019 to a further group of senior managers (approximately 284 individuals in total in each respective year) under the LTIP. The vesting of the RSU awards is not subject to performance targets, but to forfeiture provisions. Provided that the employment relationship continues: • RSU awards granted to non-French employees will vest in equal portions over a period of three years at the anniversary of the date of grant.
• RSU awards granted to French employees cliff-vest at the second anniversary of the date of grant and their requisite service period represents two calendar years starting on 1 January 2021 for 2021 awards, 1 January 2020 for 2020 awards, and 1 January 2019 for 2019 awards.
In 2021, a new EC member received replacement awards in the form of RSUs (RSU replacement awards) and TSR awards (TSR replacement awards) and twelve new employees received RSU replacement awards to compensate for outstanding deferred awards forfeited as a result of joining the Company. RSU replacement awards granted to the new EC member are subject to a 1-year tiered vesting period, with 50% of the awards vesting immediately after grant and the remaining 50% vesting after one year at the anniversary of the date of grant. TSR replacement awards granted to the new EC member are subject to a 2-year tiered vesting period, with 80% of the awards vesting after one year and the remaining 20% vesting after two years at the anniversary of the date of grant. RSU replacement awards granted to non-EC members vest in equal portions over a period of 3 years at the anniversary of the date of grant with the exception of two non-EC members with different vesting.
1 ROIC is defined as the rolling four quarter EBITA excluding one-offs divided by the rolling four quarter average of invested capital. Invested capital includes Intangible assets (gross), Property, equipment, and leasehold improvements, Operating lease right-of-use assets, Net working capital excluding cash (Trade accounts receivable and Other current assets, less Accounts payable and accrued expenses), Other assets (non-current), and Goodwill, adjusted for Goodwill impairments after 1 January 2021.
2 Cash conversion is calculated as free cash flow before interest and tax paid (FCFBIT) divided by EBITA excluding one-offs. FCF comprises cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures.

In 2020, special RSU awards (sRSU awards) were granted to a group of senior managers (281 individuals in total). The vesting of the sRSU awards is not subject to performance targets, but to forfeiture provisions. Provided that the employment relationship continues: • sRSU awards granted to non-French employees will vest in equal portions over a period of three years at the anniversary of the date of grant.
• sRSU awards granted to French employees are subject to a 3-year tiered vesting period, with 67% of the awards vesting after two years and the remaining 33% vesting after three years at the anniversary of the date of grant.
In 2020, a new EC member received replacement awards in the form of RSUs (RSU replacement awards) and TSR awards (TSR replacement awards) and nine new employees received RSU replacement awards to compensate for outstanding deferred awards forfeited as a result of joining the Company. RSU replacement awards granted to the new EC member are subject to a 3-year tiered vesting period, with 50% of the awards vesting after two years and the remaining 50% vesting after 3 years at the anniversary of the date of grant. TSR replacement awards granted to the new EC member are subject to a 1.5-year tiered vesting period, with 48% of the awards vesting after 0.5 years and the remaining 52% vesting after 1.5 years at the anniversary of the date of grant. RSU replacement awards granted to non-EC members vest in equal portions over a period of 3 years at the anniversary of the date of grant.
In 2019, a new EC member and two new employees received replacement awards in the form of RSUs (RSU replacement awards) to compensate for outstanding deferred awards forfeited as a result of joining the Company. RSU replacement awards granted to the new EC member are subject to a 3-year tiered vesting period, with 50% of the awards vesting after two years and the remaining 50% vesting after 3 years at the anniversary of the date of grant. RSU replacement awards granted to non-EC members vest in equal portions over a period of 3 years at the anniversary of the date of grant.
The plan foresees that participants who terminate their employment with the Company at their own will and those who receive notice of termination for cause before the end of the performance period (in the case of performance share awards) and before the end of the vesting period (in the case of RSU awards), will no longer be entitled to the vesting of the awards. In case of an involuntary termination without cause before the end of the performance period, a time-weighted pro-rata portion of the unvested performance share awards granted in 2021, 2020, and 2019 will vest at the regular vesting date, depending on the level of target achievement. In the case of an involuntary termination without cause before the end of the vesting period, a time-weighted pro-rata portion of the unvested RSU awards will vest at the regular vesting date. The Company bases its forfeiture rate estimations on historically observed rates as well as on employment trends of the plan participants.
PSU awards The fair value of the PSU awards was determined based on the grant date market price of the Adecco Group AG share, less a discount for not being entitled to any dividends over the vesting period, multiplied by the probability factors relative TSR, ROIC and CCR (each weighted one-third) estimated on the date of grant with an additional discount applied due to a 2-year post-vesting restriction on the sale of share awards. The probability factors of the ROIC and CCR are assessed via an analysis of historical and future ROIC and CCR figures. Refer to section “TSR awards” below for details relating to the relative TSR component.
Compensation expense of such performance condition share awards is recognised on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, based on estimated achievements. The expense impact of changes in the estimated attainment must be recognised as a cumulative catch up of prior service period.

TSR awards The fair value of the relative TSR awards was determined based on the grant date market price of the Adecco Group AG share, less a discount for not being entitled to any dividends over the vesting period, multiplied by the probability factor estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo simulation, with an additional discount applied due to a 2-year post-vesting restriction on the sale of share awards. The Monte Carlo simulation runs a very large number of share price simulations based on various parameters (share prices, volatilities, dividends, expected returns, etc.). The average result of these simulations provides the probability that the Company’s TSR targets will be achieved. The implied volatility was determined by reference to the implied volatilities of the Company’s peer group as provided by Standard & Poor’s financial research database CapitalIQ. The expected dividend yield is based on actual dividends paid.

An additional discount is applied to determine the fair value of the RSU awards granted to all participants due to a 2-year post-vesting restriction on the sale of share awards. The discount is not applied to determine the fair value of the RSU replacement awards and the sRSU awards as no post-vesting restriction applies. Compensation expense of such service condition share awards is recognised on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, taking into account estimated employee forfeitures.

Note 13 – Employee benefit plans. 
In accordance with local regulations and practices, the Company has various employee benefit plans, including defined contribution and both contributory and non-contributory defined benefit plans.
Defined contribution plans and other arrangements The Company recorded an expense of EUR 77 in 2021, EUR 73 in 2020 and EUR 85 in 2019 in connection with defined contribution plans, and an expense of EUR 82, EUR 66 and EUR 65 in connection with the Italian employee termination indemnity arrangement in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.
The Company sponsors several non-qualified defined contribution plans in the USA for certain employees. These plans are partly funded through Rabbi trusts, which are consolidated in the Company’s financial statements. As of 31 December 2021 and 31 December 2020, the assets held in the Rabbi trusts amounted to EUR 167 and EUR 142, respectively. The related pension liability totalled EUR 151 and EUR 132 as of 31 December 2021 and 31 December 2020, respectively.
Certain employees in Sweden are covered under the ITP multi-employer pension plan (employer identification number 55927) administered by a union. The data available from the administrator of the plan (Alecta) is not sufficient to determine the projected benefit obligation or the net assets attributable to the Company. Consequently, this plan is reported as a defined contribution plan. As of 31 December 2021 and 31 December 2020, Alecta managed approximately EUR 97,400 and EUR 84,500, respectively, of plan assets on behalf of 2.6 million private individuals and 35,000 companies. Total contributions made by all plan members to this plan in 2020 amounted to EUR 5,975. The information on total contributions made by all plan members in 2021 has not yet been published by Alecta. Contributions made to this plan by the Company amounted to EUR 1 in 2021, EUR 2 in 2020 and EUR 2 in 2019.
Defined benefit plans The Company sponsors defined benefit plans principally in Switzerland, India and the UK. These plans provide benefits primarily based on years of service and level of compensation, and are in accordance with local regulations and practices. The defined benefit obligations and related assets of all major plans are reappraised annually by independent actuaries. The measurement date in 2021 and 2020 for all defined benefit plans was 31 December. Plan assets are recorded at fair value, and consist primarily of equity securities, debt securities, and alternative investments. The projected benefit obligation (PBO) is the actuarial present value of benefits attributable to employee service rendered to date, including the effects of estimated future pay increases. The accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) is the actuarial present value of benefits attributable to employee service rendered to date, but excluding the effects of estimated future pay increases.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised as a component of Other comprehensive income/(loss), net, in the period when they arise. Those amounts are subsequently recognised as a component of net periodic benefit cost using the corridor method.
The components of net periodic benefit cost for the defined benefit plans are as follows:
Swiss plan Non-Swiss plans in EUR 2021 2020 2019 2021 2020 2019. 
Components of net periodic benefit cost.

The overall expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for the Company’s defined benefit plans is based on inflation rates, inflation-adjusted interest rates, and the risk premium of equity investments above risk-free rates of return. Long-term historical rates of return are adjusted when appropriate to reflect recent developments.
The assumptions used for the defined benefit plans reflect the different economic conditions in the various countries. The actuarial assumptions used to determine benefit obligations are as follows:

The investment policy and strategy for the assets held by the Company’s pension plans focus on using various asset classes in order to achieve a long-term return on a risk-adjusted basis. Factors included in the investment strategy are the achievement of consistent year-over-year results, effective and appropriate risk management, and effective cash flow management. The investment policy defines a strategic asset allocation and a tactical allocation through bands within which the actual asset allocation is allowed to fluctuate. The strategic asset allocation has been defined through asset-liability studies that are undertaken at regular intervals by independent pension fund advisors or by institutional asset managers. Actual invested positions change over time based on short- and long-term investment opportunities. Equity securities include publicly traded stock of companies located inside and outside Switzerland. Debt securities include corporate bonds from companies from various industries as well as government bonds. Alternative investments include interest rate risk management funds (liability-driven investments) and foreign exchange forwards used to hedge the foreign exchange risk of alternative investments. Real estate funds primarily consist of investments made through a single real estate fund with daily pricing and liquidity.

Note 14 – Financial instruments. 
Risk and use of derivative instruments. 
The Company conducts business in various countries and funds its subsidiaries in various currencies and is therefore exposed to the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In order to mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations, the Company assesses its exposure to currency risk and hedges certain risks through the use of derivative instruments.
As the Company is exposed to interest rate risk through its financial investments and borrowings, the Company manages this risk using derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps. Using inputs such as management guidance, macro environment and financial market conditions as well as underlying exposure duration, the Company endeavours to optimise its fixed/floating rate mix profile and optimally manage interest expense. The Company has entered into interest rate swaps to hedge or offset the fixed interest rates on the hedged item, matching the amount and timing of the hedged item and subsequently allowing it to adapt the profile of its outstanding debt.
The main objective of holding derivative instruments is to minimise the volatility of earnings arising from these exposures in the absence of natural hedges. The responsibility for assessing exposures as well as entering into and managing derivative instruments is centralised in the Company’s treasury department. The activities of the treasury department are covered by corporate policies and procedures approved by the Board of Directors, which prohibit the use of derivative instruments for trading and speculative purposes. Group management approves the hedging strategy and monitors the underlying market risks.
Fair value of derivative financial instruments The following table shows the notional amount and the fair value of derivative financial instruments as of 31 December 2021 and 31 December 2020:

In addition, the Company recorded a gain of EUR 3 in 2021, EUR 3 in 2020 and EUR 1 in 2019, in Interest expense related to the amortisation of terminated hedges.
Furthermore, the net swap settlements that accrue each period are also reported in Interest expense. No significant gains or losses were recorded in 2021, 2020, or 2019, due to ineffectiveness in fair value hedge relationships. No significant gains or losses were excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness of the fair value hedges in 2021, 2020, or 2019.

Cash flow hedges Cross-currency interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges are used to offset foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on long-term debt instruments. The Company further uses foreign currency contracts designated as cash flow hedges to mitigate exposure to foreign currency exchange rate volatility arising from intercompany cash flow within the next 12 months denominated in other currencies than Swiss Francs. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges are used to lock in interest rates prior to the issuance of debt.
For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the changes in the fair value of derivative instruments is reclassified into earnings in the same period as the hedged transaction impacts earnings.

Foreign currency contracts and cross-currency interest rate swaps are used to hedge the net exposure of subsidiary funding advanced in the local operations’ functional currency. Contracts are entered into in accordance with the Company’s approved treasury policies and procedures and represent economic hedges. Gains and losses on these contracts are recognised in earnings and are included in Other income/(expenses), net, in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

Annual Report 2021 147. 
Credit risk concentration Financial instruments that potentially expose the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash investments, short-term investments, trade accounts receivable and derivative financial instruments. The Company places its cash and short-term investments in major financial institutions throughout the world, which management assesses to be of high credit quality, in order to limit the exposure of each investment.
Credit risk, with respect to trade accounts receivable, is dispersed due to the international nature of the business, the large number of customers, and the diversity of industries serviced. The Company’s receivables are well diversified and management performs credit evaluations of its customers and, where available and cost-effective, utilises credit insurance.
To minimise counterparty exposure on derivative instruments, the Company enters into derivative contracts with large multinational banks and limits the level of exposure on short-term investments with each counterparty.

In 2021, the Company recognised an unrealised gain of less than EUR 1 on equity securities still held at the reporting date. No equity securities were sold in 2021.
The Company uses the following methods and assumptions in estimating the fair values of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis: • Money market funds and equity securities: The fair value of money market funds and equity securities is estimated using quoted market prices.
• Derivative assets and liabilities: The fair values of interest rate swaps and foreign currency contracts are calculated using the present value of future cash flows based on observable market inputs. FX options are valued based on a Black-Scholes model, using observable market inputs. The Company adds an adjustment for non-performance risk in the recognised measure of fair value of derivative instruments. The non-performance adjustment reflects the Credit Default Swap (CDS) applied to the exposure of each transaction. The Company uses the counterparty CDS spread in the case of an asset position and its own CDS spread in the case of a liability position. As of 31 December 2021 and 31 December 2020, the total impact of non-performance risk and liquidity risk was an adjustment of less than EUR 1.

Note 17 – Income taxes. 
Adecco Group AG is incorporated in Switzerland and the Company operates in various countries with differing tax laws and rates. A substantial portion of the Company’s operations are outside Switzerland. Since the Company operates worldwide, the weighted-average effective tax rate will vary from year to year depending on the earnings mix by country. The weighted-average tax rate is calculated by aggregating pre-tax income or loss in each country in which the Company operates multiplied by the country’s statutory income tax rate. Income before income taxes in Switzerland totalled EUR 443, EUR 267, and EUR 301, in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Foreign source income/(expense) before income taxes amounted to EUR 310, EUR (199), and EUR 775 in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.
The provision for income taxes consists of the following: in EUR 2021 2020 2019.

In 2021, 2020, and 2019, the reconciling item “items taxed at other than weighted-average tax rate” includes the effects of certain state and local taxes as well as the French business tax. In accordance with French legislation, a portion of the business tax is computed based on added value and consequently, under US GAAP, this component is reported as income tax. Furthermore, in 2021, 2020, and 2019, the reconciling item “items taxed at other than weighted-average tax rate” includes positive impacts related to prior year movements in tax contingencies of EUR 3, EUR 15, and EUR 6, respectively.
In 2021, 2020, and 2019, the reconciling item “non-deductible expenses and other permanent items” includes permanent items related to intercompany provisions, foreign exchange, and other write-offs that are deductible for tax purposes, but have no impact on the consolidated financial statements.
In 2021, the positive impact of the reconciling item “net change in valuation allowance” is mainly related to a EUR 37 decrease from changes in temporary differences in Switzerland and a EUR 23 decrease in valuation allowance on prior year and current year losses in Germany, and the Netherlands. This was partially offset by a EUR 3 increase in valuation allowance on capital losses in the USA.
In 2020, the negative impact of the reconciling item “net change in valuation allowance” is mainly related to a EUR 17 increase from changes in temporary differences in Switzerland and a EUR 35 increase in valuation allowance on prior year and current year losses in Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden. This was partially offset by a EUR 7 decrease in valuation allowance on temporary differences and prior year losses in Australia.

In 2019, the negative impact of the reconciling item “net change in valuation allowance” is mainly related to a EUR 210 increase due to changes in temporary differences in Switzerland.
In 2021, 2020, and 2019, the reconciling item “intangible assets tax basis in excess of book basis” represents negative impact of EUR 18 and positive impact of EUR 17 and EUR 216, respectively, due to the recognition of intangible assets in Switzerland.
In 2019, the positive impact of the reconciling item “other, net” includes a positive EUR 25 impact due to changes in deferred taxes primarily due to the sale of Soliant Health Inc., and a positive EUR 4 impact due to tax rate changes on deferred taxes.
As of 31 December 2021 and 31 December 2020, a deferred tax liability of EUR 20 and EUR 18, respectively, has been provided for non-Swiss withholding taxes and additional Swiss taxes due upon the future dividend payment of cumulative undistributed earnings which are not considered permanently reinvested. Furthermore, in 2021 and 2020, the Company has not provided for income and withholding taxes on certain non-Swiss subsidiaries’ undistributed earnings as such amounts are considered permanently reinvested. As of 31 December 2021 and 31 December 2020, such earnings amounted to approximately EUR 719 and EUR 697, respectively. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of taxes that would be payable upon remittance of these earnings.

Management’s assessment of the realisation of deferred tax assets is made on a country-by-country basis. The assessment is based upon the weight of all available evidence, including factors such as the recent earnings history and expected future taxable income. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to a level which, more likely than not, will be realised.
Valuation allowance on deferred tax assets of foreign and domestic operations decreased by EUR 51 to EUR 315. Included in the change of the valuation allowance is a net decrease of EUR 34 due to changes in temporary differences primarily in Switzerland, a net decrease of EUR 22 for current and prior years’ losses mainly in Germany and the Netherlands, a decrease of EUR 7 due to divestitures, offset by a net increase of EUR 12 related to changes in enacted tax rates and foreign currency fluctuations.

In certain jurisdictions, the Company may have more than one tax payer. The table above reflects the statutes of limitations of years open to examination for the major tax payers in each major tax jurisdiction.
Based on the outcome of examinations, or as a result of the expiration of the statute of limitations for specific jurisdictions, it is reasonably possible that the related unrecognised tax benefits for tax positions taken regarding previously filed tax returns could materially change in the next 12 months from those recorded as liabilities for uncertain tax positions in the financial statements. An estimate of the range of the possible changes cannot be made until issues are further developed or examinations close.
Significant estimates are required in determining income tax expense and benefits. Various internal and external factors may have favourable or unfavourable effects on the future effective tax rate. These factors include, but are not limited to, changes in tax laws, regulations and/or rates, changing interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations, results of tax audits, and changes in the overall level of pre-tax earnings.

Note 19 – Segment reporting. 
As part of the new strategic programme Future@Work, the Company realigned its business along three distinct Global Business Units (GBU): Adecco, LHH (Talent Solutions) and Modis. Effective 1 January 2021, the Company updated its primary segment reporting to align with the corresponding changes in Executive Committee responsibilities.
As a result of this change, the primary segment reporting transitioned to a brand-driven organisational model structured around solutions-based business groups comprising Adecco (further split by geography: France; Northern Europe; DACH; Southern Europe & EEMENA; Americas; and APAC), LHH (Talent Solutions) and Modis. The structure is complemented by secondary segment reporting of the Company’s service lines (comprising Flexible Placement; Permanent Placement; Career Transition; Outsourcing, Consulting & Other Services; and Training, Up-skilling & Reskilling). Prior year information has been restated to conform with the current year presentation.
The Company evaluates the performance of its segments based on operating income before amortisation of intangible assets, which is defined as the amount of income before amortisation of intangible assets, interest expense, other income/(expenses), net, and provision for income taxes. Corporate items consist of certain expenses which are separately managed at corporate level. The Company has not disclosed the segment assets because management does not currently review segment assets by Global Business Unit. The accounting principles used for the segment reporting are those used by the Company.
Revenues derived from Flexible Placement represented 82% in 2021, 83% in 2020 and 85% in 2019 of the Company’s revenues. The remaining portion was derived from Permanent Placement, Career Transition, Outsourcing, Consulting & Other services, and Training, Up-skilling & Re-skilling.

Note 20 – Commitments and contingencies. 
As of 31 December 2021, the Company has future purchase and service contractual obligations of approximately EUR 1,177, of which EUR 917 relates to commitments in connection with the acquisition of AKKA Technologies in 2022 (as outlined in Note 22). The remaining balance is primarily related to IT development and maintenance agreements, marketing sponsorship agreements, equipment purchase agreements, and other supplier commitments. Future payments under these arrangements translated using 31 December 2021 exchange rates are as follows: in EUR 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 Thereafter Total. 
Purchase and service contractual obligations 1,123 29 15 5 3 2 1,177. 
Guarantees and standby letters of credit The Company has entered into certain guarantee contracts and standby letters of credit that total EUR 680. The guarantees primarily relate to government requirements for operating a temporary staffing business in certain countries and are generally renewed annually. The standby letters of credit mainly relate to workers’ compensation. If the Company is not able to obtain and maintain letters of credit and/or guarantees from third parties, then the Company would be required to collateralise its obligations with cash. Due to the nature of these arrangements and historical experience, the Company does not expect to be required to collateralise its obligations with cash.
Contingencies In the ordinary course of business, the Company is involved in various legal actions and claims, including those related to social security charges, other payroll-related charges, and various employment-related matters. Although the outcome of the legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company believes it has adequately reserved for such matters.

Note 21 – Enterprise risk management. 
The Company’s Board of Directors, who are ultimately responsible for the risk management of the Company, has delegated its execution to Group management whilst maintaining oversight.
The enterprise risk management process is embedded into the Company’s strategic and organisational context. The process is focused on managing risks as well as identifying opportunities. The Company’s risk management process covers the significant risks for the Company including financial, operational and strategic risks. All segments perform the risk management process on a regular basis and report their results to Group management. The Company’s risk management activities consist of risk identification, risk analysis, risk mitigation and risk monitoring.
Group management has provided an extensive risk catalogue, defining risk categories which can have a significant impact on the Company’s results. These were updated to reflect the learnings and impact of Covid-19 as well as the upcoming acquisition of AKKA Technologies (as outlined in Note 22). Those key recurring risk categories are, amongst others, geopolitical, social and economic uncertainty, client attraction and retention, associate attraction and retention, employee attraction and retention, information technology, changes in regulatory/legal and political environment, compliance with laws and regulations, disruptive technologies, data protection and cyber security, and environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors. All risk categories are considered in the assessment performed by all segments within the Company.
The risk assessment includes the following steps: identification of risks that could impact the financial results or strategic achievements, assessment of the likelihood of the risk occurrence, assessment of the effectiveness of existing internal controls, and development of action plans needed to mitigate the risk to an acceptable level.
The risk assessment is aligned with the Company’s organisational structure. The segments report to Group management a comprehensive risk assessment, including mitigating actions. At Group management level, the individual segment results are reviewed and discussed with segment management before being consolidated.
The financial reporting risk includes the failure to comply with external reporting requirements due to failure of internal controls and/or lack of knowledge of financial reporting requirements relating to accounting and reporting. The Company has implemented a Group Policy environment as well as an Internal Control System in order to mitigate the risk of failure to comply with financial reporting requirements. The Company’s Internal Control System is designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company’s management and Board of Directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of its published consolidated financial statements.
The financial market risk primarily relates to foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates and is further discussed in Note 14. These exposures are actively managed by the Company in accordance with written policies approved by the Board of Directors. The Company’s objective is to minimise, where deemed appropriate, fluctuations in earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. It is the Company’s policy to use a variety of derivative financial instruments to hedge these exposures in the absence of natural hedges.
The Company concluded that the risk management process has worked properly throughout 2021.
Note 22 – Subsequent events. 
The Company has evaluated subsequent events through 9 March 2022, the date the consolidated financial statements were available to be issued.
On 24 February 2022, the Company announced it had acquired 59.91 percent of the shares issued by AKKA Technologies for EUR 917 (EUR 844 in cash plus 1,626,772 new ordinary shares in Adecco Group AG (EUR 73) or a purchase price of EUR 49 per share). This acquisition brought the Company’s total holding of AKKA Technologies to 64.72 percent. As of 31 December 2021, the Company owned 2.91 percent of the shares issued by AKKA Technologies with a market value of EUR 44 (included within Other Assets) and the remaining 1.90 percent of the shares issued by AKKA Technologies with a market value of EUR 29 were purchased between 1 January 2022 and 14 February 2022. At the same time, the Company also announced it will launch a Mandatory Tender Offer for the remaining AKKA Technologies securities for a purchase price of EUR 49 per share. Modis, the Company’s high-tech services Global Business Unit, will be combined with AKKA, a leader in engineering R&D services, to become a leading engineering and digital solutions business in the Smart Industry market. Akkodis has been announced as the future global brand for the combined business, leveraging the existing value of both brands and providing a clear, distinct brand proposition to customers and colleagues that will amplify future business development. AKKA Technologies will be consolidated by the Company as of 24 February 2022. The initial accounting for the business combination is incomplete at the time the financial statements are issued.
On 23 February 2022, in connection with the AKKA Technologies purchase price agreement Adecco Group AG issued 1,626,772 new shares for the value of CHF 76 (EUR 73) from authorised capital.
No other significant events occurred subsequent to the balance sheet date, but prior to 9 March 2022, that would have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
152 Annual Report 2021


Statutory auditor’s report on the audit of the consolidated financial statements to the General Meeting of Adecco Group AG, Zürich. 
Annual Report 2021 157. 
Opinion. 
We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Adecco Group AG (the Company), which comprise the consolidated balance sheets as of 31 December 2021 and 2020, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended 31 December 2021 and the related notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements (pages 110 to 152) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of 31 December 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended 31 December 2021, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and comply with Swiss law.

Basis for opinion. 
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America (US GAAS) and in accordance with Swiss law and Swiss Auditing Standards. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to be independent of the Company and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements relating to our audits. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

Key audit matters. 
Key audit matters are those matters that were communicated with those charged with governance and, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2021. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Revenue recognition and recoverability of trade accounts receivable. 
Area of focus The Company applies judgement regarding the recognition of complex service contracts and in determining whether a sales arrangement needs to be recognized on a gross or on a net basis (principal versus agent considerations). Judgement is also applied when accruing revenue (unbilled revenues). Trade accounts receivable represent 34% of the Group’s total assets and 107% of the Group’s total shareholders’ equity as of December 2021. The Company applies judgement to its ability to collect outstanding receivables and unbilled revenues on an entity-by-entity basis.
We determined the risk of improper revenue recognition with respect to new or complex service contracts and/or transactions, completeness and existence of time sheets, manipulation of customer billings, recoverability of accounts receivable, creditworthiness of the counterparty and unbilled revenues is a key audit matter. Refer to Note 2 and Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for the Company’s disclosures on revenue and trade accounts receivable respectively.
Our audit response. 
We assessed the Company’s internal controls over its significant revenue and trade accounts receivable processes, also considering the applicable accounting policy for revenue recognition. We selected samples of service contracts and revenue transactions to assess their occurrence, completeness and measurement. We performed procedures concerning the existence and valuation of trade accounts receivable, including debtor circularization. To assess the net realizable value of trade accounts receivable, we evaluated specific individual circumstances of a debtor, the aging of unbilled revenues and receivables, historical collection data and current economic trends.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. 
Statutory auditor’s report on the audit of the consolidated financial statements to the General Meeting of Adecco Group AG, Zürich (continued) 158 2021 Annual Report. 
Recoverability of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. 
Area of focus Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets represented 22% of the Group’s total assets and 68% of the Group’s total shareholders’ equity as of December 2021. As stated in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets is tested at least annually for impairment.
Effective 1 January 2021, the Company has revised its primary segment reporting to align with the changes in Executive Committee responsibilities. The reporting units have transitioned to a brand-driven organizational model structured around solutions-based Business Groups comprising Adecco, Modis, and Talent Solutions.
Furthermore, the Company performed its annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of 2021 and determined that there was no other impairment.
Key assumptions concerning the impairment test are disclosed in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements. In determining the fair value of reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets, the Company must apply judgment in estimating — amongst other factors — future revenues and profit margins, long-term value and longterm growth, and discount rates taking into consideration the economic environment due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Due to the significance of the carrying values for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets and the judgment involved in performing the impairment test, this matter was considered significant to our audit.
Our audit response. 
We assessed the Company’s internal controls over its annual impairment test and key assumptions applied. We evaluated Management’s interpretation of reporting units. We involved EY valuation specialists to assist in examining the Company’s valuation model and analyzing the underlying key assumptions, including long-term growth and discount rates.
Further we assessed future revenues and margins, the historical accuracy of the Company’s estimates and its ability to produce accurate long-term forecasts also considering the unprecedented economic environment. We evaluated the sensitivity in the valuation resulting from changes to the key assumptions applied and compared certain key assumptions to corroborating external information such as economic outlooks.

Responsibility of the Board of Directors for the consolidated financial statements The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the provisions of Swiss law, and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of consolidated financial statements that are free of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Board of Directors is required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for one year after the date that the consolidated financial statements are available to be issued.
154 Annual Report 2021


Annual Report 2021 159. 
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements. 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with US GAAS, Swiss Law, and Swiss Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user based on the consolidated financial statements.
In performing an audit in accordance with US GAAS, Swiss Law, and Swiss Auditing Standards, we: • Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.
• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.
• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed.
• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
• Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time.
We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal control-related matters that we identified during the audit.

Other information in the annual report The Board of Directors is responsible for the other information in the annual report. The other information comprises all information included in the annual report, but does not include the consolidated financial statements, the stand-alone financial statements, the remuneration report and our auditor’s reports thereon.
Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information, and we do not express an opinion or any form of assurance thereon.
In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and consider whether a material inconsistency exists between the other information and the consolidated financial statements, or the other information otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work performed, we conclude that an uncorrected material misstatement of the other information exists, we are required to describe it in our report.

Report on other legal and regulatory requirements. 
In accordance with article 728a para. 1 item 3 CO and the Swiss Auditing Standard 890, we confirm that an internal control system exists, which has been designed for the preparation of consolidated financial statements according to the instructions of the Board of Directors.
We recommend that the consolidated financial statements submitted to you be approved.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. 
Report of the Statutory Auditor on the Financial Statements to the General Meeting of Adecco Group AG, Zürich 168 2021 Annual Report. 
As statutory auditor, we have audited the financial statements of Adecco Group AG, which comprise the balance sheet, statements of operations and notes (pages 156 to 167), for the year ended 31 December 2021.

Board of Directors’ responsibility. 
The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the requirements of Swiss law and the company’s articles of incorporation. This responsibility includes designing, implementing and maintaining an internal control system relevant to the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. The Board of Directors is further responsible for selecting and applying appropriate accounting policies and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.

Auditor’s responsibility. 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with Swiss law and Swiss Auditing Standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers the internal control system relevant to the entity’s preparation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control system. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
Opinion In our opinion, the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2021 comply with Swiss law and the company’s articles of incorporation.
Report on key audit matters based on the circular 1/2015 of the Federal Audit Oversight Authority Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.
We have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the Auditor’s responsibility section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements. The results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the financial statements.

Annual Report 2021 169. 
Recoverability assessment of investments in subsidiaries. 
Area of focus. 
Adecco Group AG evaluates its investments in subsidiaries for recoverability annually and records an impairment loss when the carrying amount of such assets exceeds the recoverable amount.
In determining the recoverable amount of the investments, the Company must apply judgement in estimating, among other factors, future revenues and margins, multiples, long-term growth and discount rates, while taking into consideration the economic environment due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
Due to the significance of the carrying values for investments in subsidiaries and the judgement involved in performing the recoverability assessment, this matter was considered significant to our audit.
Our audit response. 
We evaluated the Company’s controls over its annual recoverability assessment including controls around key assumptions applied. We involved valuation specialists to assist in examining the Company’s use of certain key assumptions, including long-term growth rate and discount rates.
We evaluated the methodology applied and the reasonableness of the underlying assumptions and judgements by comparing certain key assumptions to corroborating external information such as economic outlooks.
We tested the calculations by checking the mathematical accuracy of the recoverability assessment model.
Our audit procedures did not lead to any reservations concerning the recoverability of investments in subsidiaries.

Report on other legal requirements We confirm that we meet the legal requirements on licensing according to the Auditor Oversight Act (AOA) and independence (article 728 CO and article 11 AOA) and that there are no circumstances incompatible with our independence.
In accordance with article 728a para. 1 item 3 CO and Swiss Auditing Standard 890, we confirm that an internal control system exists, which has been designed for the preparation of financial statements according to the instructions of the Board of Directors.
We further confirm that the proposed appropriation of available earnings complies with Swiss law and the company’s articles of incorporation. We recommend that the financial statements submitted to you be approved.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. 
Non-US GAAP information and financial measures. 
Non-US GAAP information and financial measures 174 2021 Annual Report. 
Non-US GAAP information and financial measures The Company uses non-US GAAP financial measures for management purposes. The principal non-US GAAP financial measures discussed herein are constant currency, organic growth, EBITA, EBITA excluding one-offs, conversion ratio, free cash flow, cash conversion, net debt, net debt to EBITDA excluding one-offs, and dividend payout ratio, which are used in addition to, and in conjunction, with results presented in accordance with US GAAP. The aforementioned non-US GAAP financial measures should not be relied upon to the exclusion of US GAAP financial measures, but rather reflect additional measures of comparability and means of viewing aspects of the Company’s operations that, when viewed together with the US GAAP results, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting the Company’s business. Because non-US GAAP financial measures are not standardised, it may not be possible to compare the Company’s measures with other companies’ non-US GAAP financial measures having the same or a similar name. Management encourages investors to review the Company’s financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. Bill rate An average hourly billing rate for temporary staffing services indicating current price levels. Pay rate An average hourly payroll rate including social charges for temporary staffing services, indicating current costs. Constant currency Constant currency comparisons are calculated by multiplying the prior year functional currency amount by the current year foreign currency exchange rate. Management believes that constant currency comparisons are important supplemental information because these comparisons exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which are outside the Company’s control, and focus on the underlying growth and performance. Organic growth Organic growth figures exclude the impact of currency, acquisitions, and divestitures. Management believes that organic growth comparisons are important supplemental information because these comparisons exclude the impact of changes resulting from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, acquisitions, and divestitures. EBITA EBITA refers to operating income before amortisation and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets. Management believes that EBITA is important supplemental information because it focuses on the underlying growth and performance of the Company’s business. EBITA excluding one-offs EBITA excluding one-offs refers to EBITA adjusted for items impacting comparability. Management believes that EBITA excluding one-offs is important supplemental information because it excludes the effect of items that are not expected to recur in future periods, and therefore shows more clearly the underlying performance of the Company’s business. EBITDA EBITDA refers to operating income before amortisation and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets and depreciation. Management believes that EBITDA is important supplemental information because it focuses on the underlying growth and performance of the Company’s business excluding non-cash charges.
EBITDA excluding one-offs EBITDA excluding one-offs refers to EBITDA adjusted for items impacting comparability. Management believes that EBITDA excluding one-offs is important supplemental information because it excludes the effect of items that are not expected to recur in future periods, and therefore shows more clearly the underlying performance of the Company’s business excluding non-recurring charges. Conversion ratio EBITA as a percentage of gross profit. Management believes that the conversion ratio is important supplemental information because this ratio displays the efficiency with which gross profit is converted to EBITA. The Company uses this metric to manage productivity and profitability. Free cash flow (FCF) FCF comprises cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures. Management believes that FCF is important supplemental information because it represents the cash generated by the Company after the investments in assets necessary to support existing business activities and to pursue internal growth opportunities. Cash conversion Cash conversion is calculated as free cash flow before interest and tax paid (FCFBIT) divided by EBITA excluding one-offs. Management believes that cash conversion is important supplemental information because this represents how much underlying operating profit is converted into cash flows of the Company before the impact of interest and taxes paid. Days sales outstanding (DSO) Accounts receivable turnover. Management believes that DSO is important supplemental information as it represents the average time taken to collect accounts receivable. Net debt Net debt comprises short-term and long-term debt less cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. Management believes that net debt is important supplemental information because this is one metric the Company uses to monitor outstanding debt obligations. Net debt to EBITDA excluding one-offs Management believes that net debt to EBITDA excluding one-offs is important supplemental information because it is one metric the Company uses to monitor its ability to meet outstanding debt obligations. Dividend payout ratio Dividend payout ratio refers to the percentage of adjusted net earnings per share paid to shareholders in dividends. Management believes that dividend payout ratio is important supplemental information because it represents the percentage of the Company’s annual profits being paid out to shareholders in the form of an ordinary dividend. Invested capital Invested capital includes Intangible assets (gross), Property, equipment, and leasehold improvements, Operating lease right-of-use assets, Net working capital excluding cash (Trade accounts receivable and Other current assets, less Accounts payable and accrued expenses), Other assets (non-current), and Goodwill, adjusted for Goodwill impairments after 1 January 2021. Management believes that invested capital is important supplemental information because it defines what capital the Company considers in its calculation of ROIC. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) ROIC is defined as the rolling four quarter EBITA excluding one-offs divided by the rolling four quarter average of invested capital. Management believes that ROIC is important supplemental information because it is one of the metrics the Company uses to assess the value created from its investments.

History. 
History. 

Annual Report 2021 175. 
The evolution of the Adecco Group is characterised by productive acquisitions, organic growth, industry innovation, and global expansion, creating a story spanning over 60 years. Today, the Group is a global leader in talent services.
1957 Adia SA is founded in Lausanne, Switzerland, by Henri-Ferdinand Lavanchy. The firm grows rapidly in its home country before expanding abroad.
1964. 
Philippe Foriel-Destezet founds Ecco in Lyon. By the early 1980s, Ecco is the largest supplier of temporary personnel in France.
1961–1980 In the 1960s, Adia opens offices in various European countries and then in 1972 takes a first step overseas, with a branch in Menlo Park, California. In 1974, Lavanchy recruits Martin O. Pestalozzi and a phase of expansion by acquisitions begins. In the next 12 years, Adia buys over 85 companies, tripling in size and gaining footholds in more than a dozen countries. These include France (1975) and the UK (1977), where it buys the market leader: Alfred Marks Bureau Ltd.
Early 1980s Adia continues to expand overseas, including Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Hong Kong, and Canada. Meanwhile, Ecco is focusing on its home market. By the mid-1980s, it is the market leader in France and a decade later world no. 2. The growth of both companies is part of a wider trend: temporary staffing becomes the world’s third-fastest-growing industry in the 1980s.
Late 1980s. 
Revenues topping USD 1 billion in 1986 make Adia the European leader. Its success is partly down to a focus on quality and high-value services. The 1990s see a growing trend towards specialised skills, e.g. accounting and word-processing, including in-house training programmes.
1990s Further acquisitions from the late 1980s further strengthen the Company’s presence in highly skilled, specialised fields. Also, moves are made into socially related programmes for mature workers in the USA, promoting the benefits of temporary work for retirees and the value for companies of tapping into their experience, skills and dedication. In 1991, recognising the importance of the industry’s role in job creation and its growth potential, Klaus J. Jacobs invests in Adia on the way to becoming its majority shareholder.
1996 Adia and Ecco merge to form the Adecco Group. Two of the world’s top three personnel services firms, with complementary geographical profiles, merge to form a strong global leader with annualised revenues of over EUR 5.4 billion. Operations are combined to form a global network of 2,500 branches. The new company has an exceptional range and quality of services. The core staffing business places around 250,000 people in work each day.
1997–2000 The 1997 acquisition of TAD Resources International strengthens the Adecco Group’s technical and IT staffing business in the USA. In 2000, the Adecco Group acquires the IT and general staffing business of the Olsten Corporation to become the no. 1 staffing services business in the USA and worldwide leader in the IT sector. The merged companies’ revenues reach over EUR 11.6 billion, reflecting organic growth and successful acquisitions. Partnerships with Monster.com and Jobs.com mark the Adecco Group’s intent to be at the forefront of harnessing the web in the recruitment process.
2002 To keep at the forefront of the trend towards increasing demand for professional and expert services, the Adecco Group consolidates its business under three operating divisions: Adecco Staffing; Ajilon Staffing/Managed Services; and Career Services/e-Business. Legislative change in Germany creates a more favourable environment for the growth of temporary staffing, reflecting greater acceptance of the industry’s positive role in generating employment and economic growth.
2004. 
The acquisition of PeopleOne Consulting in India signals the Adecco Group’s commitment to play a leading role in the industry’s development in the emerging markets. As a result of the delay in the audit of the 2003 financial statements in early 2004, the Adecco Group strengthens its financial reporting and governance structure.
2005–2006 In 2005, Klaus J. Jacobs assumes the Chair and CEO roles, initiating a strategy review. The Adecco Group’s focus on professional staffing services intensifies. To create a strong platform for growth, the Group’s existing operations are realigned into global business lines defined by specific occupational fields, complementing the established office and industrial offering with professional staffing lines.
Acquisitions of Altedia and HumanGroup strengthen the Adecco Group’s involvement in professional segments in Europe. In 2006, the acquisition of DIS AG in Germany gives the Adecco Group leadership in the German professional staffing industry. Dieter Scheiff is appointed Chief Executive Officer. The Adecco Group adopts a dual strategy focused on professional and general staffing.
2007 Jürgen Dormann is appointed Chair of the Board. As planned, Klaus J. Jacobs hands back his mandate. The Adecco Group acquires Tuja Group, an industry leader in Germany, one of the world’s fastestgrowing temporary staffing markets.

179 2021 Annual Report. 
At the Adecco Group, we have a long-standing commitment to reporting on our progress, demonstrating how we contribute towards creating more prosperous, fulfilled societies and a more sustainable relationship with our planet.
We have published a standalone Sustainability Report since 2008 and have included relevant elements in the Annual Report ever since. This builds on the recognition that companies that hold themselves accountable to their stakeholders and increase transparency will be more viable – and valuable – in the long term. To reflect our integrated approach to sustainability and holistic understanding of stakeholder value creation, since the 2019 Annual Report we have folded the Sustainability Report completely into the Annual Report.
To help our stakeholders find the information relevant to them, we have prepared this content index, providing references to the following recognised frameworks and standards: • The Sustainability Reporting Standards 2020 of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) – an independent organisation that helps businesses worldwide communicate their impact on critical sustainability issues.
• The Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics framework (SCM) – sponsored by the World Economic Forum’s International Business Council, this framework provides a core set of metrics and disclosures intended to align mainstream reporting on performance against ESG indicators with the aim of bringing greater comparability and consistency to ESG reporting.
• The recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) – created by the Financial Stability Board with the intention to enable financial markets to have access to clear, comprehensive, high-quality information on the impacts of climate change.
• The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board framework for the professional & commercial services industry (SASB) – a guide that identifies the subset of ESG issues most material to financial performance in each industry.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. 
Personal impressions. The future of work and 2021. 
For many of us, 2021 was characterised by new and sometimes challenging ways of working.
We had to adapt to the stop-start disruption of Covid-19 lockdowns, followed by periods of release and fewer restrictions – only to have to lockdown again as a new variant appeared. Some people could not work remotely, some wished they didn’t have to. At one and the same time, the Adecco Group embarked on the first year of its Future@Work strategy and transformation.
To capture this Zeitgeist, we asked our global creative team for their interpretation of 2021 and the Future@Work theme.
Our Online Art Gallery www.adeccogroup.com/investors/annual-report/art-gallery/
Jacob Keeler English, 1970 Global Creative Team – Marketing ‘Enter, Return’ Photoshop collage. 
We can’t look into the future without seeing ourselves. We all enter a path into the unknown and along the way we experience things and meet others. The future of work will be driven by social trends and advancements in tech, but let’s hope not to the detriment of the environment. Let’s not forget to dream!
Cover. 
Our artists and designers rose to our challenge and delivered a range of images and designs that are personal to them, their experience of 2021 and of their take on Future@Work.
How we experience the world of work is different for us all. We are grateful our colleagues have the talent to create their visualisation of this demanding artistic brief.
We’d also like to thank them all for generously sharing their striking and thought-provoking images – which were all created as they continued to deliver graphics and design projects for the Group, during their normal busy schedules.
Vojtěch Antonín Kamas Czech, 1990 Global Creative Team – Marketing ‘My workplace, my choice’ Blender 3.1, Cycles render and colour correction in Photoshop. 
I built this 3D scene with a fresh spin on the Adecco Group logo, rendering my vision of a green future and freedom of workplace.

Simon Culdaut French, 1984 Global Creative Team – Marketing ‘The Way’ Photoshop. 
Lots of things will change in the future; we cannot have total control on the external factors… So a team must focus and create their own happiness and make working together a happy experience. Whatever will happen in the future, work experience will still be defined by the people you are working with, and the way you interact with them.
p.24. 
Atanas Milanov Bulgarian, 1992 Global Creative Team – Marketing ‘TAG Prisma’ Skeuomorphs, unity. 
Showcasing the colours of the future through a prism inspired by the Adecco Group’s graphic symbol silhouette.
p.12. 
Jonathan de la Mora Mexican, 1983 Global Creative Team – Marketing ‘The Creation-19’ Photomontage “The creation-19” is a piece that marks the beginning of a new post-pandemic reality, where digital automation will be given life and integrate into our lives and influence the way we work.
p.5. 
Alejandro Gabino Mexican, 1990 Global Creative Team – Marketing ‘Sharing the Future’ Photomontage. 
One of the biggest things to explode during this pandemic has been the rise of the “Shared Economy”. It has aligned itself to be the future of how we purchase things but also it has been beneficial as an example of the future at work. My work represents three main attributes of this multi-dollar concept, from the companies who participate to what the future holds.

Ulises Urdapilleta Mexican, 1985 Global Creative Team – Marketing ‘Facing the Future’ Traditional cutout collage. 
Everyone is covered up; through the last two years, we have seen how humanity adapts to the digital world, but at the same time, I have seen how we have lost a small amount of what makes us human. This artwork conveys our diversity, multiculturalism and the passage through time reshaped uniquely, as we face the future at work.
p.50. 
Nuria Martinez Spanish, 1995 Global Creative Team – Marketing ‘Virtual Root’ Vector illustration combined with image. 
This represents the connection between the digital and natural world, and how humans can link both worlds and balance them.
p.41. 
Alexandre Espinosa British/Mexican, 1984 Global Creative Team – Marketing ‘Today & Tomorrow’ Photomontage. 
These last two years have accelerated our digital interaction, thus paving the way to a whole new World. This piece explores a colourful intake into a future where innovation is a must.
p.38. 
Nathan Tolley American, 1976 Global Creative Team – Marketing ‘The Labor of Cost’ Vector illustration, Illustrator. 
Looking past the near future, what does work look like?
A fearful symmetry of consumable cogs feeding the machine, or a hyper-connected exchange of thoughts and ideas to brighten the path ahead. Is it a vertigo of expendable talent and tightening profit margins, or a synchronous dance of collaborative progress and growth? p.33.

Barbora Tomečková Czech, 1993 Global Creative Team – Marketing ‘The Nomad Age’ Vector pixel art created using grids. 
Pixel art shadowing remote/nomad work. Pixel art is used to outline the digital age. The beach setting is an exaggeration that stands for remote work and work-life balance.
p.61. 
Caroline Wren Welsh, 1971 Global Creative Team – Marketing ‘Get Ready (Monochrome)’ Kinetic type. 
Kinetic type to evoke how things (in the future of work) are changing quickly and not always as predicted and so cannot be pinned down as crisp and exact.
p.108. 
Elizabeth García Mexican, 1984 Global Creative Team – Marketing ‘The Living Sphere’ 3D render with photomontage. 
We are entering a new reality where the home office will become the social backbone within a company. My piece seeks to raise awareness of how we need interaction as social beings to collaborate and create. While the concept of working from home has brought positive changes, the reality of selfisolation hubs could become the norm in a not-too-distant future. So, let’s adapt our new way of working with consciousness.
p.64. 
Alejandra Otero Mexican, 1988 Global Creative Team – Marketing ‘Progressive Landscapes’ Ink & Digital illustration. 
With the pandemic, we have experienced advantages and disadvantages of working from home. The future caught up with us, and companies are now uniquely positioned to create the right ecosystem to bring people back together in a blink. This artwork expresses having a healthier environment for the labour system’s essential pillar: the workers.

We’ve been living in an extraordinary age. Let’s use all the advantage we got. Creativity has no borders. Just... Carefully. Jiří Horák Czech, 1991 Global Creative Team – Marketing ‘Digital Nomads’ Photoshop collage. 
As millions of people around the world were stuck at home during the pandemic, this situation brought an amazing opportunity - the luckier ones could just grab a laptop and go anywhere. Suddenly people who thought they could never leave their offices can now work from their dream destinations as true digital nomads.
Lorena Pineda Mexican, 1988 Global Creative Team - Marketing ‘Falling Into the Future’ Digital illustration & montage. 
The pandemic accelerated the way society works and communicates, and through that change, we have witnessed a number of mental health issues. My work brings to light the pitfalls of an unbalanced lifestyle and how it can cut you in half.
