Alphabet discloses Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) information across a number of reports, blogs and websites. The ESG index below maps our most recent public disclosures available as of April 2022, to the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on ClimateRelated Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework. We are on a continuous journey to advance our ESG initiatives and reporting, and will continue to evaluate and enhance our ESG disclosures as we make progress.

SASB Index. 
Our Index references SASB’s industry standards for Internet Media & Services (“IM”), our identified primary industry, and includes select metrics from industry standards Software & IT Services (“SI”) and Hardware (“HW”) to better align with our business. In certain instances, we have not reported the specific metrics suggested by SASB, and instead point to disclosures describing how we evaluate and manage these matters within our business.
