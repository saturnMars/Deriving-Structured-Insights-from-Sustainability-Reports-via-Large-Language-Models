Responsible Corporate Economic and Risk management Contents banking governance financial review and compliance 2021 consolidated directors’ report. 
This report was approved unanimously by our board of directors on 24 February 2022. 
Our approach to this document. 
We changed the layout of our consolidated directors’ report in 2018 by including the contents previously provided in these documents which we ceased to prepare separately: – Annual report – Consolidated directors’ report – Annual corporate governance report (CNMV format document) – Report of the board committees – Sustainability report – Annual report on our directors’ remuneration (CNMV format document)
Auditors’ reviews. 
As required by law, contents of our 2021 consolidated directors’ report has been subjected to three types of reviews by our independent statutory auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers Auditores, S.L., summarized as follows: – PricewaterhouseCoopers Auditores, S.L. has verified that the information in this report is consistent with our consolidated financial statements, and that its contents comply with the applicable regulations. For more details, see ‘Other information: Consolidated management report section of the 'Auditor’s report' within 'Auditor's report and consolidated annual accounts'.
Non-IFRS and alternative performance measures. 
This report contains, in addition to financial information prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and derived from our consolidated financial statements, alternative performance measures (APMs) as defined in the Guidelines on Alternative Performance Measures issued by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) on 5 October 2015 and other non-IFRS measures. These financial measures that qualify as APMs and nonIFRS measures have been calculated with information from Santander Group; however, those financial measures are not defined or detailed in the applicable financial reporting framework nor have been audited or reviewed by our auditors. We use these APMs and non-IFRS measures when planning, monitoring and evaluating our performance. We consider these APMs and non-IFRS measures to be useful metrics for our management and investors to compare operating performance between accounting periods.
The consolidated directors’ report also includes all information required by Spanish Act 11/2018 on non-financial information and diversity. It can be found in the 'Responsible banking' chapter, which constitutes the consolidated non-financial information statement.
This report's format presents information more clearly, avoiding repetition and raising the level of disclosure.
– PricewaterhouseCoopers Auditores, S.L. has issued a verification report, with limited assurance, on the non-financial and diversity information required by Spanish Act 11/2018 included in this report. To read that report, see the 'Independent verification report' in the 'Responsible banking' chapter.
– PricewaterhouseCoopers Auditores, S.L. has issued an independent reasonable assurance report on the design and effectiveness of Banco Santander's internal control over financial reporting, found in section 8.6 of the 'Corporate governance' chapter.
Nonetheless, these APMs and non-IFRS measures should be considered supplemental information to, and are not meant to substitute IFRS measures. Furthermore, companies in our industry and others may calculate or use APMs and non-IFRS measures differently, thus making them less useful for comparison purposes.
For more details on APMs and non-IFRS measures, see section 8 of the 'Economic and financial review'.

Forward-looking statements. 
Banco Santander advises that this annual report contains “forwardlooking statements” as per the meaning of the US Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements may be identified by words like expect, project, anticipate, should, intend, probability, risk, target, goal, objective, estimate, future and similar expressions. Found throughout this report, they include (but are not limited to) statements on our future business development, economic performance and shareholder remuneration policy. However, a number of risks, uncertainties and other important factors may cause actual developments and results to differ materially from our expectations.
The following important factors, in addition to others discussed elsewhere in this annual report, could affect our future results and could cause materially different outcomes from those anticipated in forward-looking statements: – general economic or industry conditions of areas where we have significant operations or investments (such as a worse economic environment; higher volatility in capital markets; inflation or deflation; changes in demographics, consumer spending, investment or saving habits; and the effects of the covid-19 pandemic on the global economy); – exposure to various market risks (particularly interest rate risk, foreign exchange rate risk, equity price risk and risks associated with the replacement of benchmark indices); – potential losses from early repayments on our loan and investment portfolio, declines in value of collateral securing our loan portfolio, and counterparty risk;
Past performance is not indicative of future results. 
Statements about historical performance or accretion must not be construed to indicate that future performance, share price or earnings (including earnings per share) in any future period will necessarily match or exceed those of any prior period. Nothing in this annual report should be taken as a profit forecast.
XHTML electronic format and XBRL tags. 
This annual report has been prepared in eXtensible HyperText Markup Language (XHTML) format, and the consolidated financial statements it includes have been tagged with eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL), in accordance with Directive 2004/109/ EC and Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815.
No offer. 
Neither this annual report nor any of the information contained herein constitutes an offer to sell, or the solicitation of an offer to buy, any securities.
– political stability in Spain, the United Kingdom, other European countries, Latin America and the US; – changes in legislation, regulations, taxes, including regulatory capital and liquidity requirements, especially in view of the UK exit of the European Union and increased regulation in response to financial crisis; – our ability to integrate successfully our acquisitions and related challenges that result from the inherent diversion of management’s focus and resources from other strategic opportunities and operational matters; and – changes in our access to liquidity and funding on acceptable terms, in particular if resulting from credit spread shifts or downgrades in credit ratings for the entire group or significant subsidiaries.
Numerous factors could affect our future results and could cause those results deviating from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. Other unknown or unpredictable factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements.
Our forward-looking statements speak only as at date of approval of this annual report and are informed by the knowledge, information and views available as at the date of this report. Banco Santander is not required to update or revise any forward-looking statements, regardless of new information, future events or otherwise.
To view the XBRL tags, you must open this document using an appropriate viewer. You can find this document with an XBRL viewer on Banco Santander's corporate website.

Materiality assessment: Identifying the issues that matter. 
GRI 102-47, 103-1. 
Our in-depth materiality review included direct stakeholder input (internal and external interviews and surveys on the bank’s ESG priorities), in line with best practice. Following the proposed Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and leading ESG reporting standards, we applied the principle of double materiality: (1) financial materiality (how ESG issues impact financial performance); and (2) environmental and social materiality (how ESG action impacts society and the environment).
Analysis inputs. 
Basics for 2021 materiality assessment → Phase 1 Based on the external landscape, key trends and our own operations, we drew up a preliminary list of 15 ESG topics and placed them into three categories: E, S and G.
→ Phase 2 We ran workshops, surveys and one-to-one interviews to set priorities; and gathered feedback from customers, employees, senior managers, investors and NGOs.
→ Phase 3 We gave topics a score and weighted them to produce a ranking in order of importance to Banco Santander.

Risk Pro: our risk culture. 
SASB FN-CF-230a.2, FN-CF-230a.3. 
The Group's risk culture is called Risk Pro (known as “I AM RISK” in the UK and the US). It’s a core element of both our corporate culture, The Santander Way, and our purpose to help people and businesses prosper. Risk Pro makes risk management “Everyone’s business” (the initiative’s motto). It's the responsibility not just of the Risk and Compliance and conduct functions but of all employees as well. The risks Santander employees must manage everyday can relate to finance, operations, conduct, compliance, cyber security, reputational, fraud, financial crime and climate. It's everyone’s responsibility to stay alert and know how to recognize, control and report them. Our performance review system, MyContribution, assigns Santander employees a common risk objective, which is 10% of their review.
Promoting and enhancing our risk culture Our risk culture is embedded in all stages of the employee cycle (hiring and onboarding, career development, daily tasks, reward and recognition). Constant communication, leading by example, support from senior management and speaking up are key to assimilating Risk Pro within the Group.
In 2021, all subsidiaries made progress with implementing the Target Operating Model for risk culture. Created in 2020, it draws on best practices to strengthen our risk culture. In November, we celebrated Risk Pro Month at the Corporate Centre; we also had our first global Risk Pro Week with the participation of the top management and our main geographies and global businesses to raise employees’ awareness of the importance of risk management in their day-to-day.
We also ran training activities to develop the required skills of our employees on strong risk culture behaviours. The Group launched Dojo, a new learning platform that will significantly boost employees’ understanding about risks.
To better assess the strength of our risk culture across the Group, we also revised questions on the risk profile assessment (RPA) and the Global Engagement survey as well as the indicators on the Risk Pro dashboard to enhance them.
Aside from our globally distributed e-magazine, Risk and C&C e-zine, we set up a Risk Pro community on Santander Now and opened many risk-themed channels (such as Supplier risk management and Credit Planet) to boost awareness of the importance of risk management.

Active listening. 
GRI 102-17. 
Speaking up and truly listening are integral to our corporate culture. Our ethical channel, Canal Abierto, is the main tool in our active listening strategy for all our stakeholders. It is available in our core geographies and enables us to learn about potential financial and accounting mistakes, or violations of our corporate behaviours, internal regulation or the law, which our employees, customers, shareholders and member of the community can report to us anonymously and confidentially. It’s accessible online or by phone, in several languages and available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
In addition to Canal Abierto, the Group practices active listening through its customer assistance and complaints channels, employee and supplier surveys and other tools. Active listening is effective in our cultural transformation, where ethics, honesty and responsibility should always characterize everything we do.

Conduct and ethical behaviour. 
General code of conduct. 
The General code of conduct (GCC) sets out the ethical principles and values all Santander employees must demonstrate. They include equal opportunity, diversity and non-discrimination, respect for people and collective rights, work-life balance, and social and environmental responsibility. The Compliance and conduct function is in charge of administering the code and promoting a culture of ethics and compliance within the organization. The Internal audit function regularly reviews compliance with the GCC's rules and procedures. Furthermore, it acts independently to verify that the code and its locally-adapted versions are appropriate and effective.
Training Every year, all our employees undertake mandatory training on the GCC.
In 2021, we launched a new course called “Your conduct matters”. Employees can brush up on the conduct rules they must follow in their day-to-day and learn why their conduct matters in helping the Group avoid criminal liability; managing conflicts of interest; and receiving courtesies from third parties.
We also have “Corporate defense”, a programme to prevent criminal risks to the Group. Every year, each Compliance unit conducts a risk assessment on whether the actions employees take on the Group’s behalf are unethical or infringe internal or external regulation and become a liability to the Group. It considers inherent risks and the unit’s control environment with recommendations or action plans for specific areas for improvement.
We also launched a programme in our core units about competition. It is based on international standards and best practices recommended by competition authorities.
Key initiatives To strengthen and promote our ethics and compliance culture, we ran these initiatives: • #yourconductmatters: Employee awareness campaigns via email, Intranet and other means to boost understanding of the General code of conduct and its implementing regulation.
• Answering employees’ queries on ethics and rules in the GCC.
• Analysing and managing conflicts of interest between employees or directors and the Group, and giving recommendations to avoid them.
• Handling complaints received through our ethical channel, Canal Abierto, enhancing processes based on lessons learned.
• Setting common principles and guidelines on receiving courtesies or invitations from third parties, including the obligation to register them. No courtesy should be worth more than 150 euros.
Procurement management policy Santander's Procurement management policy sets out the principles and lines of action employees who procure goods and services and negotiate with suppliers must follow. It requires, at all times, transparent, objective and balanced decision-making, avoidance of conflicts of interest; and protection of confidential information.

Responsible Corporate Economic and Risk management Contents banking governance financial review and compliance. 
Code of Conduct in Securities Markets Santander’s Code of Conduct in Securities Markets (CCMV) is our main policy on market abuse risk management and control. It sets out the standards board members, directors and employees must abide by when handling sensitive information or trading in securities markets on their own behalf. It outlines the necessary controls and transparency to safeguard the interests of the Group’s investors as well as market integrity.
The last updated version that the board of directors approved in June 2020 includes the minimum market abuse risk standards our units trading in securities markets must consider.
Our core units have tools to help detect potential market abuse and ensure the consistent management of those risks across the Group.
According to CCMV guidelines, those subject to it receive regular training on market abuse. Furthermore, once a year they verify their understanding of key obligations and the penalties that Santander and its employees could face if they fail to fulfil them.
Financial Crime Compliance (FCC)
GRI 103-1, 103-2, 103-3 and 205-2 SASB FN-AC-510a.1, FN-CB-510a.1, FN-IB-510a.1. 
FCC on vulnerable customers The new Financial Crime Compliance Customer Lifecycle Due Diligence Procedure, approved in late 2020 and transposed across the Group in 2021, includes a section on vulnerable customers. The procedure reinforces the Group's commitment to "reducing the stigma associated with the provision of financial services to vulnerable customers" and provides a compliance framework for Santander business units to follow in meeting this commitment while mitigating financial crime risk responsibly.
FCC on anti-bribery and corruption In 2021, the board of directors approved a more extensive FCC Corporate Framework. Its scope of financial crime risk includes bribery and corruption. It sets out essential details of the Group’s anti-bribery and corruption (“ABC”) programme, including required processes and controls to manage bribery and corruption risk with third parties, sponsorships, charitable and political donations, joint ventures and principal investments, travel, gifts and courtesies, marketing, employment, and work experience.
FCC on training As part of the Group’s strategic FCC transformation plan, we redesigned the required computer-based introductory training module. It features case studies on compliance challenges regarding product innovation and international sanctions; lessons on environmental crime, human trafficking and child exploitation online, drug trafficking, and terrorist financing.
Also, as part of the more extensive FCC Corporate Framework, we launched an upskilling initiative for the corporate FCC function, with several in-depth, face-to-face (virtual) training sessions with external and internal experts in bribery and corruption, tax evasion, complex ownership structures and payments infrastructure and other areas.
Our courses have a self-assessment to ensure understanding of key financial crime risks and policy requirements. In 2021, 164,547 employees were trained.

Environmental and social risk management. 
GRI 102-11, 413-2, FS10 and FS11. 
We embed environmental and social standards in risk management to support sustainable and inclusive growth, uphold human rights, preserve the environment and aid the transition to a low-carbon economy.
Our Environmental, social and climate change risk management policy sets out the standards for investing in, and providing financial products and services to, companies and customers who engage in sensitive activities in the oil and gas, power generation, mining and metals, and soft commodities industries (especially retail customers involved in farming and ranching in the Amazon). We review customers in credit risk, insurance, advisory, equity and asset management transactions (especially in the corporate and investment banking (SCIB) segment).
We analyse customers subject to the policy with a detailed questionnaire that their assigned banker completes before a team of analysts conducts an overall assessment of their environmental and social (E&S) risks (which we update every year). We also analyse oneoff, project-related transactions in accordance with the Equator Principles and such international regulations as the IFC Performance Standards. Following our environmental and social due diligence of projects, we set out corrective measures based on their risk rating.
We apply our Environmental, social and climate change risk management policy in conjunction with our Human rights policy. In addition, the Social and environmental risks and Compliance departments carry out extra due diligence on cases with red flags. In 2021, we ran extra due diligence on customers in an industry and region with human rights concerns (namely forced labour).
The findings, which provide further input for decision-making, are submitted to risk approval committees.
In 2021, we began to consider social and environmental components in our credit quality analyses of customers in the SCIB segment.
We created a multidisciplinary team to help enhance the identification, remediation and mitigation of social and environmental risks (including human rights), analyse customer engagement throughout their relationship with us, spot deficiencies and implement action plans.
Moreover, the Group follows the precautionary principle, analysing and managing key environmental risks throughout the value chain as well as considering the direct impact on the assets where we operate and the indirect impact stemming from our activity.
For more details on environmental and social risk management and climate risks, see 'Risk management and compliance' chapter of this report.
Our environmental, social and climate change risk management, human rights and sustainability policies are available on our corporate website www.santander.com.
Equator Principles We have applied the Equator Principles to all project-related transactions (especially project finance) since 2009 and promote them through the Equator Principles Association working groups to make sure every project we’re involved in meets the expected sustainability standards.
In 2021, we analysed 63 projects that fall within the scope of the Equator Principles (see table with the categorization of projects according to the Equator Principles in the 'Key metrics' section of this chapter).
Tackling environmental crime The principle of nature conservation extends to all the Group's units. The Financial crime compliance function understands the importance of recognizing that “behind every environmental crime there is a financial network”, not only because of the large sources of revenue that organized crime draw from these activities, but because crimes like illegal deforestation have a significant impact on carbon sequestration. Industries we consider "restricted" due to exposure to environmental crime risk include (but are not limited to) logging, pulp and paper mills, palm plantations, commercial fishing, trapping and transport of live animals and waste management. Given their "restricted" status, Santander entities that provide services to companies in those industries must respond to their elevated financial crime risk by implementing enhanced controls. Furthermore, our customer screening tools include specific terms on environmental crimes to help us flag issues and conduct assessments, and our global and in-person senior management training also includes environmental crime case studies and trends.
We engage in several public-private partnerships as part of our commitment to detect, disrupt and deter environmental crime. In 2021, our Financial crime compliance function was the chair of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime's (UNODC) Private Sector Dialogue on Disruption of Financial Crimes Related to Forestry Crimes, which brought together financial institutions, authorities, investigative law enforcement units and supranational governmental bodies to discuss intelligence sharing, typologies and policy strategies on disrupting the financial crime networks behind illegal deforestation. The inter-governmental Financial Action Task Force (the FATF – the “global money laundering and terrorist financing watchdog”) also asked the function to represent the private sector in an awareness-raising, global webcast on environmental crime. Santander also remains an active member of the United for Wildlife’s Financial Taskforce against illegal wildlife trade.

Santander and the Brazilian Amazon. 
GRI 304-3. 
Santander is committed to protecting the Amazon rainforest, while helping promote sustainable development and practices.
Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon has been taking place over several decades: logging, mining, property speculation, lack of clear land titles and large infrastructure projects in the region have all played a role.
Given the growing concerns about climate change and biodiversity conservation; our global policy on environmental, social and climate change risk management; and our commitment to the Equator Principles, we take additional care when lending to Brazilian clients with operations in the Amazon: ◦ All loan requests by farmers and ranchers to Santander Brasil are checked for embargoes issued by the government because of illegal deforestation. In the first quarter of 2022, we will have the capability to check, on a daily basis, whether there was deforestation on the.

GRI 412-2. 
Santander commits to respecting and upholding the human rights of our employees, customers, partners and communities when doing business. As a financial institution, we operate according to our internal framework on human rights as well as the international standards we are subject to.
Our board-approved Human rights policy, based on the highest international standards (especially the 2011 United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights), sets out our responsibilities in terms of commitment, due diligence, access to remedy and claim. Our Human rights policy is consistent with our General code of conduct, Consumer protection policy, Corporate culture policy and Environmental, social and climate change risk management policy. It sets out Santander’s standards and commitments to uphold and defend these human rights: • Zero tolerance towards employee, customer and supplier discrimination, forced labour and child exploitation.
• Freedom of association, collective bargaining, health and satisfactory employment conditions.
• Support to communities in collaboration with government agencies, civil associations and other organizations to ensure a clean, healthy environment and help stamp out corruption.

◦ Clients’ practices in Brazil are reviewed regularly. We conduct annual ESG reviews of more than 2,000 customers, including beef processors, soy traders and logging companies.
◦ Looking ahead, we expect beef processing clients in the Amazon to have a fully traceable supply chain that is deforestation-free by 2025, including indirect suppliers of cattle, as a prerequisite for granting credit.

Principles of action in tax matters. 
GRI 103-1, 103-2, 103-3, 207-1, 207-2, 207-3. 
Santander pays its fair share of taxes in the jurisdictions where we operate. Our board-approved tax strategy (available online) sets out the principles that apply to the entire organization.
All the group’s entities must comply with its tax risk management and control system in accordance with the internal control model.
Since 2010, we've abided by the Code of Good Tax Practices in Spain and by the Code of Practice on Taxation for Banks in the United Kingdom. Furthermore, we've participated in cooperative compliance initiatives led by various tax authorities. Since 2015, we've voluntarily submitted the annual Tax Transparency Report to Spain's Tax Authority.
Core principles of Santander’s tax strategy → Satisfy our tax obligations based on a reasonable interpretation of tax laws, grounded on their spirit and intention.
→ Respect the rules on transfer pricing and pay taxes in each jurisdiction in accordance with our functions, assumed risks and profits.
→ Not give customers tax advice or planning strategies when marketing and selling financial products and services.
→ Communicate Santander's total tax contribution clearly, distinguishing between taxes borne by the Group and by third parties for each jurisdiction.
→ Not create or acquire entities registered in offshore jurisdictions without board of directors' approval; and adequately monitor and gradually reduce the group's operations in such territories. A → Maintain a good working relationship with tax authorities based on the principles of transparency and mutual trust to avoid disputes and minimize litigation.

Tax contribution To contribute to the communities in our geographies, we pay all taxes borne directly by the Group (taxes paid by the Group B) and collect others' taxes originating from our business operations (taxes from third parties C).
In 2021, our tax contribution totalled EUR 16,178 million, including EUR 7,617 million in taxes directly paid by the Group.
For every 100 euros in total income, EUR 34 are taxed, including: • EUR 16 in taxes paid directly by Santander.
• EUR 18 in taxes collected from third parties;
The taxes recorded in our annual income statement mainly stem from corporation tax accrued during the accounting period (EUR 4,894 million in 2021, which represents an effective rate of 33.6%, or, deducting the extraordinary results, EUR 5,076 million, which represents an effective rate of 33.3% D). They also include nonrecoverable VAT, employers' social security contributions and other charges, including those that are exclusively levied on banks and financial transactions (such as in Spain, the UK, Poland, Portugal, Brazil and Argentina). These taxes are recorded as they are generated, irrespective of when payment is made.
The taxes Santander pays directly (see table below) are included in the cash flow statement. The tax rate when comparing the corporate income tax paid (EUR 4,012 million) with the Group’s pretax profit is 27.6%. Additionally, total taxes paid directly by the Group amounts to 52% of the profit before tax.
The taxes we accrue and the amounts we pay do not usually match because the laws in some countries dictate a different payment date than when income was generated or an operation was taxed.
We pay taxes in the jurisdictions where we earn a profit. Thus, the profits obtained, and the taxes accrued and paid, correspond to the countries where we operate.
For more details on the country by country report requested on GRI 207-4, see ‘Key Metrics’ in this chapter.

It protects whistleblowers by expressly prohibiting reprisals or any negative consequence against them. Every unit in the Group administers its own ethical channel in its local language according to the common standards of the corporate Canal Abierto.
Minimum standards include: • subsidiary CEOs’ endorsement of the ethical channel; • employees’ awareness of the importance of using the channel; • reporting to the Group about management, action and improvement plans; • guarantee of easy platform access and anonymity (if desired); • use of external platforms to receive reports according to best practice; • mechanisms in place to manage conflicts of interest in internal investigations of reported cases; and • internal audits of the channel.
These standards are included in our Canal Abierto policy, which we approved in 2020 and implemented in our core markets in 2021.

Canal Abierto is mainly set up to receive reports from employees; however, it’s open in some subsidiaries to third parties (e.g. suppliers, customers, investors and other interest groups), who cannot use it to submit complaints or queries.
All incidents reported through Canal Abierto are handled appropriately, even if they are found to be unsubstantiated. Canal Abierto and its common standards help create an environment where employees can feel free to speak up and report what is not up to par so appropriate action can be taken to handle it. Thus, the implementation of Canal Abierto standards and the many actions taken correlate with the better Speak Up results from the Global engagement survey.
In 2021, we received 4,338 reports on the Group’s channels. Of the 3,628 that had been well founded to merit investigation, 1,196 led to disciplinary action and 312 resulted in dismissal. The average processing time was 42 days.

Relations with political parties. 
Santander is committed to principles of transparency, honesty and impartiality in its interactions with political parties and other entities with public and social purposes that are also political in nature.
Since 2016, our board executive committee-approved policy on financing political parties (available on our corporate website) has applied to all our subsidiaries worldwide. It prohibits making monetary or in-kind election donations and contributions. In commercial relationships, Santander prohibits full or partial debt forgiveness for political parties and their affiliates. Even though they can negotiate the terms of debt, the interest rate can never be below market rate. Furthermore, the policy applies to political parties’ electoral candidates to the extent local laws provide.
Santander did not make any donations or contributions to political parties in 2021.

In line with the diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) strategy we defined in 2020, we continue to cultivate a workplace where our people can be themselves and reflect the diverse society we live in.
Our structure enables us to manage diversity properly, ensure compliance with policies on this matter and promote these initiatives: • Global executive DE&I working group, which brings together senior positions from all our geographies regularly to review results, propose initiatives and drive internal change.
• Global DE&I team, which draws up global initiatives, coordinates the teams involved and acts as liaison for the subsidiaries and businesses.
• Local DE&I teams in each subsidiary and business, which are responsible for implementing strategic plans and initiatives locally as well as sharing best practice.
Through them, we followed these strategic pillars in 2021: • Involving our leaders: Their commitment to openness, inclusion and diversity will help strengthen a diverse and inclusive culture. In 2021, our directors received DE&I global mandatory training and 31% connected to webinars that delved deeper into those topics.
• Raising awareness: Promoting diversity through global standards and actions, such as flexiworking, parental leave, training, employee networks and celebrating international days.
• Promoting equality: Special focus on increasing the number of women in senior positions and on development programmes.

Gender equality Santander fosters equal opportunity between men and women. While women make up 54% of our workforce, their presence in senior positions is less. We're taking action to have more women at all levels of senior positions.
In 2021 we instituted global minimum parental leave of 14 weeks for one parent and 4 weeks for the other.
We're also taking measures to fight sexual harassment, which our code of conduct addresses explicitly, and have an equality plan in Spain with rules to prevent sexual harassment and gender-based disparities.
Equal pay. 
GRI 102-35. 
In 2021, we adapted our global equal pay policies to make them neutral and eliminate gender-based disparities. We also amended our policies on remuneration, performance management and succession planning.
Our strategy attaches importance to equal pay between men and women, which we measure in terms of pay gap and equal pay for equal work.
Women members on our board Women in senior positions A Equal pay gap. 
Our target: Our target: Our target: 40-60% 30% 0% in 2021 in 2025 in 2025. 
Our progress: Our progress: Our progress: 40% 26.3% 1%
A. Senior positions are 1% of total headcount.
Grupo Santander features in the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index and is its highest-scoring bank. 
Gender pay gap: 32.3%
What it measures: The gender pay gap measures differences in compensation between women and men in an organization, business, industry or the broader economy, irrespective of the type of work. At Santander, fewer women hold senior and business management roles than men (something we are focused on addressing), while more women work in retail banking and support roles.
We calculate the gender pay gap as the difference in the median remuneration paid to male and female employees, expressed as a percentage of the male remuneration. Our remuneration schemes factor in base salary and variable pay, but not corporate benefits/in-kind compensation or local allowances.
Our progress: Santander addresses the gender pay gap with a methodology based on best practices and common guidelines for the Group and local units. We maintain rigorous standards for promotions, recruitment, succession planning, implicit bias training and talent pipelines to strengthen diversity, with communications from executives as well as mentoring, networking and other actions aimed at achieving greater balance in the organization. Local units have action plans in place based on their own characteristics and conditions.
The gender pay gap was slightly wider than last year (31.7% in 2020) because of the greater pay difference between new hires and leavers' owing to the general under-representation of women in STEM A fields and to our higher ratio of women to men selected to fill non-executive and support roles.
A. STEM: Science, Technology, Engineer and Mathematics.
Equal pay gap: 1%
What it measures: The equal pay gap gauges the difference "equal pay for equal work" for women and men in the same job at the same level. Our comparison does not consider certain factors, such as tenure, years of service, previous experience and background.
Our progress: Santander set up fair pay programmes to reduce the equal pay gap (our target is 0% in 2025). They include systematic reviews tied to remuneration cycles (merit-based promotions and bonuses), work reorganization and career development plans to recruit, engage and retain diverse talent.
Our equal pay gap, which stood at 1.5% in 2020, declined this year as a result of our strong commitment and wide-ranging action plans across the organization.
We continued to make progress in standardizing the criteria of our approach in all geographies and increasing the headcount of the segment we analysed. We will continue conducting robust reviews and analyses of pay data to detect, understand and act on any gaps.

People with disabilities. 
GRI FS14. 
Our diversity, equality and inclusion strategy sets two objectives for the inclusion of people with disabilities: • To meet (or exceed) the legal quota for employees with disabilities, raising their 2019 headcount by 1% in countries without a legal quota by 2025 A.
• To comply with local accessibility laws and make sure all new digital products meet the Web Accessibility Initiative’s (WAI) WCAG 2.0 Level AA standards.
Santander has networks for employees with disabilities in Argentina, Mexico, Spain, the UK, the US and our Corporate Centre. In 2021, on top of local celebrations in our geographies, we held a global event to mark International Day of Persons with Disabilities, with employees from Argentina, Brazil, Spain, Portugal and the UK. 954 people connected to our global event.
A.This objective exempts countries where it is not legal to collect disability data.
2021 Initiatives. 
In 2021, despite the organizational changes that the Group has implemented in some geographies, the number of employees with disabilities remained at 1.9%.
Fundación Universia is a core partner in Santander's efforts to include people with disabilities. We work closely to make Banco Santander a more diverse and inclusive bank.
We also collaborate through volunteering in other programs of guidance for people with disabilities: Speaking without frontiers, InMentoring Programme, Digital Mentoring, Families helping families, adapted bicycles.
For more details on our D&I initiatives, see the Diversity and Inclusion report in our corporate website.
For more details on Fundación Universia see 'Supporting higher education' or 'Support to higher education and other local initiatives' in this chapter or go to www.fundacionuniversia.net.
In Brazil, #Diversiprática helps university students with disabilities and the Black community through a foundation course for the CPA10 and CPA20 financial market certificates. We also launched an engagement plan that includes a welcome toolkit for employees with disabilities and their managers, as well as mentoring and training programmes.
In Argentina, the Inclúyeme (“Include me”) programme promotes the employability of people with disabilities and assists companies in implementing social and labor inclusion strategies. Moreover, we hold 10 financial education talks for 200 people. We began using the Háblalo (“Talk about it”) app at our branches to remove communication barriers, and undertook basic sign language training.
Santander España devised an onboarding plan for people with disabilities at its branches and other plans for technology-based roles. It helped 30 people with disabilities join us in 2021.
Santander Portugal renewed its partnership with Associação Salvador. Its "Destination: Employment" project promotes the employability of people with disabilities through guidance and empowerment of candidates, raising awareness among companies and identifying job opportunities. Five people were hired through the project.
The Bank also collaborates with the Portuguese Asperger's Syndrome Association (APSA) to promote the social and professional integration of people with Asperger's syndrome, hiring two people from it.

Employee wellbeing. 
GRI 102-35, 403-2, 403-3, 403-5, 403-6,403-9. 
In 2021, we appointed a global head of health and well-being to help draw up a strategy and implement it across our footprint. We also have local teams with around 60-70 members with their own organizational structure and resources that coordinate all our wellbeing initiatives.
We drafted our Global health and well-being policy, which will be available to the public in 2022. To ensure enforcement of the policy and to fulfil our strategic priorities, we began working on a global guide that will set standards on mental and emotional health, digital balance and other priority areas to be implemented by subsidiaries.
Covid-19 As part of our Covid-19 response, we continued to enforce these prevention measures to make sure our employees stayed healthy: • Masks, gloves and protective screens handed out to office and branch employees. We imposed strict personal hygiene policies and rearranged work spaces to accommodate social distancing.
• Remote working, especially for our most vulnerable employees in accordance with domestic and international authorities’ recommendations. We offer equipment (e.g. office chairs, computer monitors and keyboards) and training (on ergonomics and stress) to make remote working more comfortable.
• Employee testing (153,000 in Spain alone) as part of our monitoring and back-to-the-office procedures.
• Information and training on Covid-19 prevention. Our corporate Intranet and all subsidiary and divisional platforms have a section for Covid-19 updates.
• Corporate monitoring plan in all our geographies in accordance with local authorities’ guidelines, including employee health screening through apps, tests and questionnaires. Progress with the plan was reported to global and local executive and management committees.
92% of employees believe everyone in their work environment is taking responsibility to comply with Covd-19 measures and procedures A. 
A. 2021 Global Engagement Survey. 
Since the outbreak of the pandemic, we’ve worked on several public and private initiatives (providing funding, resources and expertise) as a leader in the response to Covid-19. The public vaccination centre we opened at Santander Group City in July, August and September to benefit the Region of Madrid administered 57,575 vaccines with utmost care (NPS=97). The bank and its partners provided all human and material resources to the centre.
Occupational health. 
GRI 103-1, 103-2, 103-3. 
On top of the measures we took to protect our employees, our collective bargaining and other industry and bank agreements include provisions on employee health and occupational risk prevention, such as check ups and testing on a regular basis or following prolonged absence.
We also work with employees’ legal representatives regularly to revise our occupational risk prevention plans, which we implement through: • regular workplace assessments of health and safety risks and preventative measures to eliminate or control them; • considering prevention measures when designing, procuring or acquiring offices, furniture, equipment, products and IT equipment; • work safety procedures, which the occupational risks prevention team perform alongside other units to spot potential risks to employees’ health and to implement prevention measures.
• information and continuous learning for employees; • embedding occupational risk prevention in all operations that may impact on employees' health and safety.
We have certifications on the security, quality and sustainability of our work environments based on national standards (e.g. Gold-level LEED O+M certification for our corporate offices in the US and ISO 14001 certification in Brazil). In 2021, we started the process to obtain ISO 45001 certification for our corporate centre, the Santander Group City.

BeHealthy. 
We’re committed to being one of the world's healthiest companies. Our employees receive health and wellness benefits. We also raise awareness through our global BeHealthy programme, which celebrated its fifth year in 2021.
Its four pillars are: know your numbers; eat well; move; and be balanced. Every year, we set health and well-being objectives and priorities with an activities calendar and global strategies for our subsidiaries to implement.
In April, we held BeHealthy Week, with daily, in-person and virtual events that covered the programme’s four pillars. The #SantanderBeHealthy campaign, launched by Executive Chair Ana Botín, top executives and our ambassador, Rafa Nadal, generated two million impressions on over 25 corporate accounts and through hundreds of employees.
Health was a key component of Santander Week in September, where all our subsidiaries ran initiatives to remind employees of the importance of health and well-being according to our four BeHealthy programme pillars.
We celebrated Global Mental Health Week in October, with all our subsidiaries and divisions taking part. 1,600 employees joined an online event with Yale University professor Laurie Santos, creator of the online course “The Science of Happiness”.
All Group employees can access health-related platforms (like "Gympass" to use gyms) and apps for nutrition, mental health, physical health, exercise, meditation and other services free of charge or at bargain rates.

Speak up - Active listening. 
GRI 406-1 SASB FN-AC-510a.2, FN-CB-510a.2, FN-IB-510a.2. 
We listen to our employees and encourage them to speak up. We act on their feedback, data and experiences and develop plans that will effect change. The many internal listening actions we take involve global and local employee surveys; performance reviews; exit interviews; incident monitoring; and our ethical channel, Canal Abierto.
Our active listening programme covered several topics in 2021, such as financial crime and Covid-19. Furthermore, 86% of our employees took a global engagement survey (GES) about the corporate purpose, the employee net promoter score (eNPS), Covid-19, streamlining processes and cooperation. We received poor marks on streamlining processes, cooperation and ways of working.
Still, it showed employees are committed to our purpose of helping people and businesses prosper; they feel Santander responded effectively to economic and business challenges in the pandemic with the right measures to ensure safety; and they recognize the strength of our risk culture and the flexibility Santander offers them to work remotely.
In 2021, we revised our global engagement survey and decided to conduct it every quarter.

Volunteering The corporate volunteering standard in our Corporate culture policy entitles employees to spend a certain number of working hours each month or year volunteering. We also promote several initiatives to enable employees to participate in, and contribute to, social programmes and initiatives that the Group already supports.
We hold two important group-wide volunteering events for employees each year: Santander Week, observed in all our countries at the same time, and International Volunteering Day. Locally, the Group’s subsidiaries organize multiple volunteering programmes as part of their community investment commitments.
In 2021, many of our collaborations continued to focus on alleviating the effects of the pandemic on the most vulnerable. We continued to run our usual volunteer programmes, always under the strictest sanitary measures. When we couldn't run them face-to-face, we delivered them virtually.
+28,000 +46,000 employees hours volunteered participating in community activities. 
For more details on our social contribution to communities, see the 'Support to higher education and other local initiatives' section in this report.
Volunteering initiatives.

Ensuring we have the right talent and skills. 
Managing our talent lifecycle is critical to our business strategy. To understand future skills gaps and needs, we implemented the Strategic Workforce Planning (SWP) tool to help us to re-train and develop employees on a near constant basis.
We also launched Dojo, our continuous learning ecosystem available to all employees, and reached almost 100% in our roll-out of Workday.
Talent attraction. 
GRI 103-1, 103-2, 103-3, 401-1 and 404-1. 
In 2021, Santander filled 35,000 vacancies worldwide (45% with women). We prioritized the career development of our people, filling over 70% of vacancies with internal candidates.
We digitalized and automated hiring processes through the “Selection” module on Workday in all our geographies (except at our US subsidiary, which will implement it from 2022). Having a single system enabled us to standardize hiring, share best practices and ensure a greater candidate experience. It also meant we could list vacancies in all the countries where we operate on our Global Job Posting portal, a new search engine that makes it easier to see the positions available in each country. We promote geographic and incompany relocations as a key means of cultivating talent.
Attracting tech and digital professionals Our recruitment teams prioritized the attraction of talented tech and digital professionals to help with the transformation of our businesses. In 2021, the Group filled over 8,500 STEM vacancies after running brand awareness campaigns on social media and in forums.
We ran the “Be Tech” programme with our IT and Communications divisions to position Santander as an attractive employer for STEM candidates. Among its stand-out initiatives were: • “Be Tech Up”, where 50 junior employees in digital roles became brand ambassadors through social media to promote the Group’s technology projects. The contents they posted helped us gain thousands of followers on such networks as LinkedIn.
• “Women in Tech”, which focused on attracting women to technology-based roles. The inaugural Women in Tech summit had over 1,000 participants.

Career development Continuous learning drives our transformation. We encourage employees to take charge of their career development. We provide them with the means to draw up their own personal development plan based on their ambitions. We strive and review all our diversity parameters to promote optimum diversity on our talent programmes.
Our main career development programmes in 2021 were: • Talent reviews to assess employees’ potential and support the professional growth of the most promising ones. For Europe, we carried out our "European Talent Review".
• Succession planning: Our strategic approach enables us to identify potential successors to key roles and provide them with career development opportunities, ensuring our future sustainability and success.
• Top Talent, to promote the development of over 130 managers with high potential. Participants assessed their skills and potential as leaders to come up with a career development plan. We’re working on development plans for every Promontorio successor (over 230 talented people with high potential).
• Young Leaders 2, with185 talented young employees from all our geographies and a diversity rating of 52%. It aims to create a strong talent pool, teach skills needed for the future and promote diversity and inclusion. It will last nine months and take place in the Young Leaders Smart City, a virtual, immersive space where they’ll come up against several challenges.
• Elevate, is the new global learning ecosystem the Group launched in 2021 for all Faro and Solaruco executives. It is a hybrid executive education experience with first-rate activities led by renowned international experts to promote continuous learning and cooperation towards a common culture that will strengthen Santander’s leadership.
• In addition, other local programs such as Open Mentoring at the Corporate Centre, Light your skills at Santander Consumer Finance Germany and Futuro in Poland were implemented.
Corporate mobility Driven diverse experiences are the best way to shore up skills and form diverse teams and multicultural leaders, so we promote geographical and functional re-location across our footprint. Though the pandemic affected international mobility in 2021, we sought to offer viable alternatives.
Our mobility initiatives were: • Global Job Posting offers employees the chance to apply for jobs in other countries, companies and divisions of Santander.
• Global career strategy. We’re working on a global career strategy to enhance our internal talent development, harness our worldwide presence and meet our businesses’ challenges successfully.
• Mundo Santander has been one of Santander's flagship talent programmes since 2008. It supports the development of over 2,000 employees who have taken part in strategic assignments in other countries for 3 to 6 months. It promotes the sharing of best practice and the broadening of participants’ global outlook. In 2021, we redesigned Mundo Santander so participants could work on international projects virtually. Though the programme will remain virtual in 2022, participants will be able to undertake a project in another country should public health conditions allow.
• We also launched an awareness campaign to promote employees’ international mobility, with videos of real examples told by the people involved.

Learning and development. 
GRI 103-1, 103-2, 103-3, 404-2. 
We value continuous learning so our employees can adapt to an ever-changing environment and help accelerate our transformation.
Our global learning and development policy sets the standards for designing, reviewing, launching, overseeing and enhancing training and development programmes to: • support our business and cultural transformation in accordance with Santander’s governance standards; and, • foster innovation, knowledge sharing and transfer, and the skills employees need to perform their duties successfully as part of global talent management.
The three pillars of our employee upskilling and reskilling are strategic workforce planning (SWP), our current skill model and the strategic global business and countries needs. We review them every year to recognize common, high-impact skills and design learning solutions for our employees.
We promote our learning solutions on our digital ecosystem, Dojo, through study plans and “roadmaps” for learning. Dojo facilitates informal, interactive and structured ways of learning, combining many formats, settings and tools so every employee can choose what, when, how and how much to learn. It's designed to produce “lifelong learners”.
Furthermore, each subsidiary’s Learning and Development team pinpoints specific learning needs relating to its geography and designs training courses consistent with Dojo’s standards.
After launching in 2020, Dojo had reached 63,700 employees in our main geographies by the end of 2021. It has four academies: Agile, Engineering Excellence, Cloud and Commercial (launched in 2021). It also offers 22 certifications, 26 channels and 24 learning programs launched in 2021covering topics such agile, data, leadership, customer experience, cloud and digital transformation. Today, Dojo covers 252 skills with more than 72,560 learning activities.

Global training. 
Main initiatives: → The Risk Pro Banking School promotes a strong, uniform risk culture. It runs the Advanced Executive Risk Programme, Key risks and Risk pro Insights workshops and specialized courses.
→ The Global Internal Audit School offers practical solutions designed to adapt to business and regulatory changes.
→ The Technology and Operations School continued to enhance its three key areas — Technology, Operations and Cyber security — (updated to key position programmes) and made its core contents available to the entire Group on Dojo (Agile Academies, Engineering Excellence and Cloud, Channels and Badges).
→ Mandatory global online training ensures we deliver a high level of service, and helps us comply with financial regulation and avoid penalties from external regulators. It’s available across our footprint and part of performance and incentive plans. The topics that courses cover relate to the Group’s external and internal regulation and strategy. In 2021, Risk Pro: Everyone’s Business, Cyber Heroes and courses on the General code of conduct, corporate defence, conduct risk in the marketing of products and services, financial crime and market abuse were prominent. To complement mandatory global training, each subsidiary has required courses about local law and regulation.
→ In Responsible banking, we are working on three training modules we set with global businesses and subsidiaries: • The first is multidisciplinary and common for all employees. We launched a global, mandatory module to familiarize them with sustainability and its relevance to the Group.
• The second is for all functions involved in our sustainability agenda and consists of an introduction to sustainability/ESG, ESG Talks (to be broadcast live across our footprint), internal certification and special programmes for each business and function.
• The third includes the appropriate certifications for each business according to its needs (e.g. CFA, EFPA, GARP and others).
Some subsidiaries and global businesses provided additional training on climate change, sustainability, sustainable finance, sustainable investment, diversity and inclusion.
In 2021, we also trained our employees on diversity and inclusion, health and safety, customer and supplier relations, the environment and anti-corruption.

Performance review and remuneration. 
GRI 404-3. 
Our comprehensive remuneration framework combines fixed and variable schemes based on employees and the company's achievements. Short and long-term variable remuneration reflects what we have accomplished (group-wide quantitative and qualitative targets, as well as individual and team targets) and how (e.g. behaviour, leadership, sustainability, commitment, growth and risk management). We also have pension plans, banking products and services, life insurance, medical insurance and other corporate benefits our employees can choose.
Fixed remuneration schemes reflect local market conditions. To set pay, we strictly abide by the practices, regulations and collective agreements in force in each country and region.
Our remuneration policy for all Group employees forbids differential treatment that is not based on a review of performance and corporate behaviours. It also promotes equal pay between men and women.
To comply with EU regulations on remuneration, we identified 1,018 employees subject to a deferred variable pay policy because their decisions can have a material impact on Banco Santander’s capital. 300 employees fewer vs 2020, mainly due to the entry into force of the new CRD V regulation. The policy defers a significant amount of their variable pay (40%-60% depending on their responsibilities) for three to seven years in accordance with internal and local regulations. 50% is delivered in shares and subject to potential reduction ("malus") or recovery ("clawback").
Key initiatives in 2021 → The inclusion of share options as part of variable pay (which was previously paid in shares) and the update of multi-annual target metrics will be put to a vote at the next AGM in 2022. The proposal includes keeping the relative total shareholder return and adding the return on tangible equity and metrics linked to responsible banking commitments.
→ Under the succession policy, senior managers must make sure the successor pool is strong and diverse (especially in terms of gender diversity).
→ Progress in monitoring the gender pay gap calculation and analysis methodology.
→ The remuneration policy added the principle that remuneration must be free of gender-based bias and help eliminate disparities that could result.

MyContribution. 
MyContribution is our common performance management model. Performance management is key to enriching our culture and ensuring colleagues perform to the best of their abilities in keeping with their career goals. Our model applies to all employees in 2021.
MyContribution has three components: • What: 50% is based on employees' individual goals set in line with group-wide strategy.
• How: 40% is based on how employees deliver on objectives and foster the values of Simple, Personal and Fair, the eight corporate behaviours and the four leadership commitments, which combine to form The Santander Way.
• Risk: 10% is based on how employees manage risk in their day-to-day role.
MyContribution is updated regularly. It now highlights our risk culture with a separate category created in 2020 to assess it.

Corporate benefits. 
GRI 401-2. 
We offer several benefits to our employees in all geographies. Each subsidiary has programmes that adapt to local circumstances. Benefits range from free services for employees and their families to discounts on products and services.
We focus on well-being to help employees stay in sound physical and mental shape, to support their families and to adapt health cover to new circumstances and needs. In Spain, our Santander Contigo programme provides assistance with daily tasks, legal and computer support, and other services. In other geographies, services and financial aid for childcare and support for elderly relatives in their charge are also substantial.
For more details on our initiatives promoting employees' wellbeing, see "Employee wellbeing" in this section.

Work-life balance and job efficiency. 
The way we work We continue to promote our employees' work-life balance through flexible working, health and well-being programmes and office safety measures.
FlexiWorking At Santander we promote flexiworking and we believe our diverse organization must adapt to the needs and characteristics of its teams.
We redesigned our global flexiworking framework to address where, when and how much we work: • 'Where': Possibility of home/remote working.
• 'When': Intensive day, flexible start/end and break times and alternative shifts.
• 'How much': Part-time working, special leave, flexible holidays, job sharing and other measures.
We have empowered our managers with the decision regarding the best flexible working model for their teams. In this way, each area and business unit has implemented new ways of working based on the characteristics and needs of the team and its performance expectations. Since the pandemic is not over, we must remain cautious and flexible.
In 2020, our return to the office depended on the severity of the pandemic developments and local regulations. In 2021, most of our branch teams have now returned, although in many cases we still operate under a hybrid working model. To support our employees who work remotely, we provide material such as office chairs to improve their conditions, as well as training on ergonomics and stress.
We continued to implement tools to drive digitization and collaboration, which helped our employees perform well and manage remote working effectively as well as to maintain their right to disconnect, preventing them from sending emails or holding meetings outside working hours.
Listening to employees, understanding the situation and attending to their needs is essential to identify and facilitate managers to adopt measures that can achieve a balance between work and professional life, while guaranteeing productivity, corporate culture and our attractiveness as an employer.
Agile methodologies We’re implementing agile methodologies and organizational structures in our Technology and Support functions in several countries.
In 2021, we continued to transform and bring more teams from our subsidiaries and global functions into the Agile environment (our subsidiaries in Spain, Mexico and Argentina were key to boosting implementation) for better customer focus, more collaboration between IT and the businesses, faster decision-making and different ways of working that will heighten employees’ sense of accountability for the end product.
82% of employees say Santander is providing the appropriate flexibility they need to be effective and productive. A 86% of our employees believed Santander’s response to the pandemic's challenges was effective . A.

Social dialogue and restructuring. 
In 2021, we continued to guarantee freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining. Our Human rights policy considers forming or joining unions and other representative bodies a basic right of workers in accordance with Article 10 of our General code of conduct. We also ensured respect for freedom of association, trade union activity, collective bargaining and protections for employees’ representatives under the laws of each country where we operate. We continued to promote and comply with the International Labour Organization’s Fundamental Conventions. We also remained in constant dialogue with employees’ legal representatives through bilateral and special committee meetings where all parties discussed reporting, queries and negotiations about work conditions and employee benefits.
Meetings we held in 2021: • Occupational health and safety committees • Equality plan follow-up committee • Santander Employees pension plan control committee • Training committee • Other meetings: 2021 engagement survey results; Banco Santander mass redundancy agreement follow-up committee (five meetings as well as regular information exchange); meetings with subsidiaries’ business committees ◦ Bilateral meetings with trade union representatives. 
Agreements entered into: • Capitalization of pension supplements for Banco Popular beneficiaries + extension • Capitalization of pension supplements for Banco Santander beneficiaries (from October 2020) • Increase in employer contributions to the Santander Employees pension plan • Integration of working conditions for Santander España Technology & Operations staff • Integration of working conditions for Santander Consumer Finance staff • Implementation of the Grupo Santander Consumer collective bargaining agreement and 2022 salary review • Santander Global Operations equality plan • 24th Collective bargaining agreement for the banking industry (members of the industry negotiation committee)
We considered the risk of failing to uphold employees’ rights low as our labour relations had proved effective in every country.
Restructuring In recent years, amid staff reductions in Spain, Portugal, Poland, the UK and other core geographies, we have consistently applied internal and external flexibility measures to support employees' transition to new employment while maintaining dialogue with their trade unions and legal representatives. In Europe, we also abide by the principles of the Joint declaration on workforce restructuring that our management representatives signed in 2016 with the European Works Council.
We take these steps to ensure the best possible outcome: → We prioritize voluntary employment termination.
→ We hold informal meetings with workers’ legal representatives to find alternatives that will reduce the impact of losing jobs and to uphold their rights before formal proceedings commence.
→ We consider particularly vulnerable employees’ personal circumstances (e.g. disabilities, severely ill children, victims of gender-based violence, etc.).
→ We help employees with outplacement either in Santander or in other companies through internal and external flexibility measures.
→ We pay severance above the amount required by law, in keeping with agreements with trade unions.

Responsible Corporate Economic and Risk management Contents banking governance financial review and compliance. 
Restructuring processes we carried out:
In 2021, we began to reduce our workforce on organizational, production-based and economic grounds. Following informal discussions with workers’ legal representatives to explain our reasons, we entered into formal negotiations that ended with an agreement with most trade unions (82.99%) All of the measures agreed with the European Works Council to align workforce restructuring with socially responsible practices were in the restructuring agreement. The alternative measures we proposed included geographic and in-company relocations to lower the number of potential lay-offs.
Our workforce reduction gave priority to voluntary employment termination and was considerate of workers’ vulnerable circumstances. We reduced the number of terminated contracts substantially (from the initial 5,072 to 3,572) and outplaced 1,500 workers in the Group. In addition to relocating employees geographically, 70% of the lay-offs involved early retirement agreements with either guaranteed temporary pay until full retirement or compensation packages above the amount provided by law, with social security contributions up to 63 years old in order not to interrupt the contribution period of employees over 50 years of age who met length-of-service requirements.
We also hired a specialized relocation agency free of charge to help affected employees (and their relatives) who wanted to find a new job, through advice and training, entrepreneurship initiatives, job searches and other activities.
There have been no class action or law suits filed by trade unions to contest the redundancy programme nor any rulings against Santander.
Within a common movement to most banks in Europe, addressing the change in banking consumers' habits and based on an intense process of digital transformation, Santander Portugal has been reducing the number of branches and digitalizing processes, with the correspondent reduction of its workforce in 2021. Our preferred approach was to reach individual settlements according to Portuguese law. Therefore, the process was conducted in constant contact with trade unions and the legal representative unit and the settlement offers included increased severance benefits, health plans, outplacement programs and early retirement proposals.
We hired an independent legal adviser to review negotiations and contact with the employees. In addition, we also created the Nova Etapa programme to support people in the transition to new personal and professional ventures.
This set of measures made it possible to reach agreements with around 96% of the workers covered by the workforce reduction. Having exhausted all individual agreement negotiations, the collective dismissal process was concluded involving 49 employees, which represent only around 4% of the overall workforce reduction undergone by the Bank.

Transforming customer experience. 
In 2021, we continued to promote our customer experience (CX) strategy to give the best service.
We created local, regional and global initiatives, which our executive committees monitor closely. Supported by our multicultural and multidisciplinary team, we prioritize customer experience enhancement initiatives with the greatest impact on customer satisfaction and potential to scale up. The CX team focused on four areas in 2021: 1. Strategy: To unify our vision, we came up with common CX guidelines to enhance customers' journeys and touchpoints, and keep them at the centre of our efforts. We also created a Customer Experience Observatory to monitor trends and learn from successful cases in the banking and other industries.
2. CX plans: We helped our subsidiaries devise and execute local plans to improve customer experience. In 2021, we launched initiatives in several geographies. Applying behavioural economics, we ran a range of use cases for new product design, procedures, communications and pricing strategy.
3. Culture: We strive to foster a productive environment for our customers that strengthens our “Customer obsession” culture across our footprint. In 2021, we created global and local CX training courses and certifications for our employees.
4. Community: Working as one team helps us serve our customers better. In 2021, we continued to streamline our global CX community to bring about synergies and share best practices, knowledge and tools across the Group.
Our Consumer protection function shares best practices across the Group through CuVo (Customer Voice), a monthly global working group formed of all our customer-facing areas. In 2021, we ran these initiatives: • In Spain, we improved the terms and conditions of the ONE account and launched the “Porque Tú, Porque Te” campaign as part of our quest to be number one for our customers.
• In Europe we have been working on a new unique app that will be launched for all 4 countries: One Europe App. So far it has been launched in Spain and Portugal, and the plan is to launch it in Poland and the UK in 2022.
• In Chile, we separated infrastructure to make sure any issue on a digital channel did not cross over to another. We also enhanced our banking app to give a better digital experience.
• In Argentina, we focused on better customer service through workshops and e-learning courses to promote our “Customer obsession” culture.
• In Uruguay, we migrated all our customers to Supernet, reducing waiting times and incident numbers.
• In Brazil, we launched Dial My App, which connects our remote customer service lines to our app, giving customers who call our contact centre a fully digital experience.

Product governance and consumer protection. 
Product, service and consumer protection framework Being responsible means offering our customers products and services that are Simple, Personal and Fair (SPF). Our daily operations must be brilliant, and do more than what the law requires, to give our customers an exceptional experience.
Our Product, service and consumer protection framework sets out the principles that promote a strong SPF relationship with customers and establishes the basics for managing and mitigating conduct risk in design, sales, post-sales and services.
Consumer protection policy and principles The Compliance and conduct function abides by our Consumer protection policy, which sets out the highest ethical standards we expect our teams to uphold towards customers.
We report on our consumer protection principles in all our geographies to make sure we embed them in our day-to-day. We use our customers’ voice and business indicators to spot unsatisfactory customer service, fee-related issues, incidents at ATMs and other areas for improvement, and to come up with plans to address them. We’re working on adding artificial intelligence to our reporting for greater insight into how we can better protect our customers.
In order to identify risks that stem from new regulations or problems with products and services, we conduct thematic reviews for the entire Group, assess them and make decisions on how to improve and mitigate the risks identified. In 2021, our review focused on such responsible business practices as pricing techniques and fair value for our customers. We also carried out a more detailed price comparison of Santander Asset Management España's investment funds and pensions against industry figures; we plan to extend that study to our other geographies in 2022.
Consumer protection principles. 
We followed up on the thematic reviews from 2020 on responsible business practices in account packages, revolving cards and overdrafts. We checked that 26 local plans on transparency, disclosure to customers, sales, fees and credit conditions were consistent with best practice. They will be implemented in 2022.
We ran product governance and customer protection awareness campaigns and workshops in line with our strategic priorities.

Sales processes. 
Salesforce cultural transformation Our product and service disclosures throughout the entire customer cycle are transparent and comprehensive. We apply robust quality and conduct control standards to marketing and sales material, brochures and contracts according to Santander’s internal regulation.
That's why all our employees undertake a mandatory, annual course on the management of conduct risks in sales and consumer protection. We run special training programmes for our sales teams to arm them with the knowledge and skills that will enable them to sell our products and services properly.
Those programmes and our sales methods ensure we offer products and services that will meet each customer’s needs and preferences. That way, we avoid inappropriate practices like product and service bundles that don’t add value for customers.
Remuneration schemes (where customer satisfaction and quality bear significant weight) are key to transforming our sales practices and promoting sustainable business. In 2021, at least 40% of our salesforce’s variable pay was linked to customer satisfaction and quality measures, an area where we enhanced best practices through continuous monitoring.
We worked on a global project to give branches a conduct and quality rating. While it will impact on employees’ pay, they’ll have access to metrics for better awareness and management of conduct-related risks.
We broadened the scope of our remuneration reviews and monitoring for teams in charge of loans and credit origination, and collections and recoveries to embed conduct and quality in their culture and objectives.
Vulnerable customers. 
GRI FS14. 
In 2021, we worked on an instruction manual about our vulnerable customer and special case management model, and set a roadmap for its roll-out among subsidiaries. This will ensure a consistent, Group-wide approach to identifying and managing vulnerable customers in such high-impact procedures as collections and fraud management. We offered monthly training courses, ran an awareness campaign at the Corporate Centre and shared the manual across our footprint.
Our subsidiaries also made progress with the roll-out of vulnerable customer management:
We used big data to identify potentially vulnerable customers and provide them with a personalized, priority service through our contact centre. This service, which has served 500,000 customers, is rated with an NPS 2.5 times higher than the standard service.
We developed a methodology based on advanced data analytics and algorithms for our collections teams to spot potentially vulnerable retail customers. We took a 1,478 sample of the customers we identified as vulnerable and proactively offered tailor-made solutions to the 293 we had found to be "extremely vulnerable”. We also waived account fees for a further 100,000 vulnerable customers.
Openbank also identified 387 vulnerable customers and registered them in the CRM system to offer personalized services.
We continued to roll out our new customer support function. It keeps a record of vulnerable customers’ support needs so our employees are aware of their situation. During the year, close to 30,000 new notes were added to our systems.
Post-sales management. 
Conduct in collections and recoveries In 2021, we implemented metrics to monitor conduct risks in all our geographies as part of our Recoveries excellence plan. They helped enhance control over the ethical standards we established last year and over customer contact, disclosures and transparency, data protection, vulnerable customers and training for employees who work in these teams.
They consist of: • quality control for calls to make sure scripts and standards are followed; • number of customer complaints about the managed portfolio and in relation to the thresholds established in view of historical data and the current situation; and • the percentage of employees who have completed mandatory training.
Each month, we saw positive metric results, with no areas of concern and a significant decline in complaints within set thresholds. Though results showed good quality control of calls, we have revised scripts and are working with the subsidiaries to enhance them and make sure conduct guidelines are appropriate and holistic.

Complaints management. 
GRI 102-34. 
Handling customer issues and complaints proactively and effectively is a vital component of customer experience and highly valuable to the business.
Our complaints management and root-cause analyses are consistent with the Group’s Simple, Personal and Fair strategy and set standards for all geographies to properly handle complaints and offer the best service. We use our findings to enhance our products and services and have an early warning system to identify risks.
In 2021, we continued to focus on resolving complaints at the first point of contact with customers and on opening digital channels like Gent& in Brazil and the complaints section of our app in Chile and Mexico for quicker, alternative access to feedback mechanisms.
We also came up with a root-cause analysis methodology that uses artificial intelligence. It helps us apply customer voice algorithms and get the most out of the structured and unstructured data on our systems. We’re testing our initial findings in Brazil and Mexico.
We heightened the monitoring and reporting of customer issues in areas that are considered critical due to the knock-on effects of the pandemic. Having implemented conduct standards during recovery in 2020, we continued to monitor pandemic-related complaints each month. While we saw improvement in most countries, Santander México (the subsidiary with the highest volume of cases) dropped from 40 complaints per 10,000 customers in Q1 2021 to 12 in Q4.
We also track management of fraud-related complaints in all geographies according to special taxonomies. Our local units’ customer-centric management includes a “trust payment” of the stolen amount in most fraud cases while they are under investigation. They are informed that it’s a temporary refund that Santander will not claim back if the investigation finds in the customer’s favour. Cases are falling significantly in Mexico (where fraud accounts for 70% of complaints), thanks to a new task force and the measures we're taking.

In 2021, we give training and advice to our payment operators, information technology (IT) technicians, developers, executives and board members, with an updated mandatory training course on cyber security.
Our campaigns to spread awareness on digital channels help our customers and society stay safe online. In 2021, we launched a new cyber security campaign through our corporate sponsorship of Rafael Nadal to reinforce messages of confidence in online banking and good online habits. We continue to spread awareness through special websites, social media campaigns, targeted announcements and online workshops.
We’re working with public- and private-sector organizations to promote knowledge sharing and cooperation on cyber security. In 2021, Santander showed leadership and went beyond basic information exchange in the fight against cyber crime: • We headed the Ransomware Threat Cell working group as part of the World Economic Forum's (WEF) public-private Partnership Against Cybercrime initiative;

Third-party certification policy. 
Responsible behaviour principles for suppliers Being responsible also ó involves our suppliers. 
Risk control. 
Whistleblowing channels. 
Our third-party certification policy provides a common methodology for subsidiaries to select, approve and evaluate their suppliers. Its responsible conduct principles set out standards for all Groupcertified suppliers in regard to usual service issues (like price and service quality) as well as diversity, inclusion, human rights and sustainability.
Santander has three supplier control and audit processes to uphold the policy and our corporate values.
In 2021, we reaffirmed our commitment to responsible purchasing and set two initiatives in motion to assess our suppliers’ compliance with environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards.
• ESG standards in procurement: We surveyed the top 200 high-risk suppliers in our geographies (in particular, Spain, Portugal, the UK, Poland, the US, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina and Chile) to spot ESG risks. The survey had 18 questions that addressed such topics as carbon footprint, gender inclusivity, disability, flexible work schemes, minimum wage and good corporate governance practices. It covered 74% of selected providers, as the rest did not provide answers. Of those, we recognized a high number carried potential ESG risks (49%). Thus, we created remediation plans that must be implemented to attain a level of risk the Group can tolerate.
The main weaknesses we found in the supply chain are the lack of environmental policy, certification (such as the ISO 14001) and greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction targets; in good governance, they were each organization’s lack of proof of remuneration policies and missing content in their codes of conduct.
As a result, in 2022 we will introduce ESG standards into critical supplier hiring. We expect to expand the initiative to our Top 1,000 high-risk suppliers.
• ESG supplier standards: We use questionnaires from business tenders to compile additional information on the corporate governance and the social and environmental impact of our suppliers in service categories involving intensive labour (such as travel and energy).
We support the local economy. Santander has 6,976 certified suppliers (-19% from 2020) A and 26.9% of all new suppliers in 2021 were certified with the inclusion of environmental and social criteria.
Through Aquanima B, we delivered 8,401 contracts (-5% compared to 2020) to 4,808 suppliers (+5% compared to 2020). 93.7% are based in the same location where we procure services and account for 95.8% of our total purchasing (-0.7 pp from 2020).
We plan to roll out our ethical channels for suppliers in our core markets to our other geographies next year.
In 2021, we tailored our response to suppliers (especially those most vulnerable) to meet their most urgent needs.
To ensure our suppliers’ income remained steady during the crisis, we continued to pay them for basic services, extended credit lines to provide them with liquidity, paid invoices early and shortened payment periods (among other measures). In particular, Santander España and Corporate Centre reduced payment periods from 11.2 days in 2020 to 9.7 days in 2021, delivering on the Group's commitment to supporting its suppliers.
We prepared and closely monitored several recommendations based on best practice to make sure measures will be applied consistently across the Group.
Risk control → In 2021, we set up our supplier risk management platform in our core markets. B Designed to rationalize and combine supplier management and critical reporting, it enables us to consolidate certification information for all suppliers.
→ Last year, we expanded our supplier risk assessment team. It reviews our essential suppliers’ cyber security, business continuity, physical security, facilities and data protection. In 2022, we will add new topics for evaluation (e.g. ESG, ABC, etc.).
→ We list our core suppliers of goods and services by region according to the risks previously mentioned.
→ We closely monitor and report regularly on our suppliers to senior management and banking regulators (e.g. ECB, PRA and OCC). In 2021, indicators for supplier risk and our ability to identify and mitigate them improved considerably.
A. In 2021, we lowered total volume after revising and consolidating suppliers. B. Except for Poland, which has its own system.

Our approach. 
In February 2021, the Group's board of directors approved the ambition to be net-zero in carbon emissions by 2050. This applies to the Group’s operations (which have been carbon neutral since 2020) and emissions from our lending, advisory and investment services.
We're working to align our climate relevant portfolios with the Paris Agreement goals and set decarbonization targets for the climatematerial sectors in our portfolio. We are committed to: i. Ending financial services to power generation customers by 2030 if over 10% of their revenues depend on coal; ii. Cutting our exposure to thermal coal mining to zero by 2030.
iii. Reducing the emissions intensity of our power generation portfolio from 0.23tCO2e/MWh in 2019 to 0.18tCO2e/MWh by 2025 and to 0.11tCO2e/MWh by 2030. 
In April 2021, we became a founding member of the Net Zero Banking Alliance (under the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative, NZBA), committing to: i. transition operational and attributable greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from lending and investment portfolios towards pathways to net-zero by mid-century; ii. set intermediate targets for priority GHG-emitting sectors for 2030 (or sooner); and iii. prioritize client engagement with products and services that facilitate the necessary transition in the real economy.
We are working on our decarbonization action plans, defining and implementing the risk and business levers needed to deliver on our portfolio net zero targets.
Santander's climate change project is one of our strategic projects. Progress is reviewed every quarter at the Responsible Banking Forum and at least twice a year by the Responsible Banking, Sustainability and Culture Committee. Also, at a senior management level, the strategy committee and the management meeting, chaired by the CEO, also conduct a progress check several times a year.
Santander Asset Management (SAM) joined the global Net Zero Asset Managers initiative (NZAMi) in March 2021 as part of its commitment to fighting climate change. To deliver on this commitment, SAM set an interim target to halve net emissions for 50% of its AUM in scope 3 by 2030. It is also participating in investors’ climate initiatives as a tool for driving change, delivering on its engagement plan, defining a sectoral strategy to reduce pollution, shifting portfolio construction gradually towards net zero, developing climate investment solutions and maintaining leadership in climate stewardship and advocacy in its core markets.
Disclosing our approach is key to helping markets and other stakeholders assess how we embed climate in our processes and policies and report on our climate-related performance. We use the Task force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) as reference. Our Climate finance report 2020-June 2021 included information about, and expanded on, TCFD.
See our latest update on the TCFD's four-pillar framework (Strategy, Governance, Risk management and Metrics & Targets) below.
More details on our Climate Report 2020-June 2021 available on our corporate website. 
See more details of the SAM strategy at "Our net zero strategy" in the Sustainable Investment section.
Our strategy At Santander, we want to play our part in supporting our customers and the global economy to be net zero by 2050.
We are offering our customers decarbonization solutions to help them fulfil their climate goals. We are aligning our portfolios with the Paris Agreement Goals and keeping our operations carbon-neutral. Integrating climate within our risk management is key to delivering our plan.
We have a four-pronged climate strategy and public commitments to: 1) align our portfolio with the Paris Agreement Goals and set sector- portfolio alignment targets in line with the NZBA and with NZAMi: to ensure projected carbon emissions will help limit warming to a 1.5ºC rise above pre-industrial levels.
2) help customers transition to a low-carbon economy, with the commitment to raise EUR 120bn in green finance between 2019 and 2025 and EUR 220bn by 2030; offer our customers guidance, advice and specific business solutions; and enable them to invest in a wide-ranging ESG proposition according to their sustainability preferences.
3) reduce our impact on the environment by remaining carbon neutral and sourcing all our electricity from renewable energy by 2025.
4) embed climate in risk management; understand and manage the sources of climate change risks in our portfolios.
Santander Asset Management operates in 10 countries and aims to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions with its assets under management by 2050, and it was the first asset manager in Spain and Latam (excluding Brazil) to join the NZAMi. This is consistent with Santander’s push for leadership in sustainability and the Group commitment to be net zero in carbon emissions by 2050.
3 Assets in scope are assets with a defined Net Zero methodology, which currently amount to 54% of total AUM. For c.50% of those, SAM has carbon metrics available today. This objective might be reviewed upwards depending on data availability.

Responsible Corporate Economic and Risk management Contents banking governance financial review and compliance 2021 highlights → To help deliver on our green finance target, we raised or facilitated EUR 32.3bn (EUR 65.7bn since 2019) and harnessed climate finance opportunities through several initiatives. (For more details see "Supporting our customers in the green transition" section.) ◦ The volume of greenfield renewable energy projects we have financed or advised represents enough installed capacity to power 9.2 million homes in a year and avoids 251 million tons of CO2 emissions A during the useful life of those projects.
◦ As well as our existing Green Book products, we developed the sustainable finance classification system (SFCS), which enables us to identify lending towards economic activities that contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation and to track these volumes consistently across the Group.
◦ We issued our third EUR 1 billion green bond to finance and refinance renewable wind and solar power.
→ We're expanding our range of ESG products in Wealth Management. As of December 2021, we had over €27bn AuM, €11bn in Santander Asset Management and €16bn from third party funds in Private Banking.
→ We reduced and offset CO2 emissions from our own operations, after becoming carbon neutral in 2020. Furthermore, 75% of our electricity comes from renewable energy sources. (For more details, see 'Environmental Footprint').
→ Climate change risks and opportunities assessments are part of our financial planning (three-year time horizons) and strategic processes (five years). In 2021, our financial planning considered our decarbonization targets as well as the green finance target and the volume of AuMs under sustainable funds. This enabled us to measure three-year projections as a key component to support the delivery of our commitments.
→ Santander's employee pension funds manager recognize the magnitude of the challenges that climate and energy transition pose to governments, companies and civil society. The pension funds manager are also aware of their impact on the ability to comply with their fiduciary duty to provide long-term riskadjusted returns to their members. They initiated the necessary actions to consider employee pension plans' alignment to net zero, showing their full support for Santander's vision and its commitment to sustainability and climate change.
→ We continue to fight deforestation and its damage to climate and biodiversity (especially in the Amazon). Protecting the Amazon rainforest is critical to tackle climate change (for more details, see our webpage on "Santander and the Brazilian Amazon") → We consider biodiversity a material topic (see our materiality assessment). Further progress in the sector is needed. Santander participated in the Taskforce for Nature related Financial Disclosures and a proof of concept soy pilot coordinated by Global Canopy and UNEP FI.
→ Santander UK was a founding member of the UK National Parks ‘Net Zero with Nature’ project. It seeks to attract funding to scale up peatland and woodland restoration across the UK. The project will generate verified high quality carbon credits and biodiversity units.
A. Emissions to be avoided over the lifetime of projects, which we have financed or advised on in 2021. Emission factors from the International Energy Agency (source updated in 2021 with 2019 data) have been used. The estimated share attributed to Santander is 66.7 million tonnes of CO2.

• The responsible banking, sustainability and culture committee (RBSCC) reviews and challenges climate change strategy and other environmental considerations. It’s an advisory body that assists the board with overseeing the climate change-related components of the responsible banking strategy. It contributes to more informed board decisions and enhanced strategic focus based on the related risks and opportunities.
In 2021, the RBSCC held four meetings, including three on climate change (at least two meetings covering climate are required). The committee discussed climate change project updates; climaterelated financial risks and opportunities; roadmaps to fulfil TCFD and ECB expectations; discussions to approve the net zero ambition and fulfilment of the bank’s net zero commitments; Santander’s sustainable finance proposition to help our customers’ transition to a low-carbon economy; plans for business lines; and progress on our carbon footprint and green finance commitments.
• To streamline our governance, we created the Responsible banking forum (RB Forum). It executes the responsible banking agenda across the Group, drives decision-making on responsible banking issues and ensures the execution of any mandates from the RBSCC, other board committees and the board of directors. It also ensures alignment on key issues, as well as the review and escalation of reports to the RBSCC.
The RB Forum meets at least six times per year. It reviews climate change and net zero strategy before discussion at the RBSCC. In 2021, the RB Forum met four times and addressed such climaterelated topics as net zero strategy, sustainable finance and carbon offsetting.

Risk management. 
GRI 102-15, 102-29, 102-30, 201-2 ▪ We continue to make progress with embedding climate and environmental risks in our key risk management processes. In 2021, we developed a quantitative metric for our risk appetite statement.
▪ We made significant progress with the credit granting process and with developing a more restrictive risk policy on sensitive sectors and activities that could damage our reputation. All SCIB corporate customers (groups) now have a climate assessment as part of the internal credit ratings.
▪ In 2021, we adapted our risk appetite to include specific limits regarding our exposure to coal customers. This will ensure the fulfilment of the decarbonization targets for coal-mining and coalrelated power generation customers as well as aiding climate risk management. (see 'Metrics and targets') ▪ In early 2022, the new version of the Environmental, social and climate change risk management policy was approved with new restrictions that will help us decarbonize our portfolios and reduce climate-related risk, including new criteria which prohibits financing and advising on new oil upstream clients, except for transactions for the specific financing of renewable energy, and direct financing of oil upstream greenfield projects.
▪ We launched initiatives to meet regulatory requirements, such as the CBES in the UK and the SSM stress tests for 2022. Furthermore, senior managers were more involved in overseeing risks associated with climate change.
▪ Santander’s Economic research department analyses the impact of climate change based on the published scenarios from the Network for Greening the Financial System, the 2021 Biennial Exploratory Scenario and other external sources.
▪ We introduced a climate change rationale into Santander’s baseline scenario to assess macroeconomic impacts on our portfolios. We also developed alternative scenarios to measure the impact other climate assumptions have on economic variables. Our climate scenarios model impacts on different economic sectors.
▪ We align climate scenario development with supervisory expectations as reflected in the ECB guide on climate-related and environmental risks published in November 2020.
▪ We conduct regular materiality assessments to identify the most climate material portfolios. They cover more than 80% of our balance sheet and include assessments of residual value, strategic, market and liquidity risks.
▪ Our Risk taxonomy and heat maps, based on TCFD and UNEP FI programmes, form the basis of a qualitative classification of portfolios and their potential exposure to climate risks. The internal climate change risk taxonomy recognizes sectors that are directly exposed to physical and transition climate risks.
▪ We use materiality assessment findings as inputs to monitor, measure and report on financial impacts and to develop new metrics for risk management, credit policies and business strategy.
▪ We are developing internal tools and models to assess climaterelated risks and impacts in our portfolios: ▪ KLIMA tool: To manage climate-related risks at corporate and unit level, considering transition and physical risks, taxonomy and heatmaps for different sectors and geographies. It is a key element to manage climate-related risk in the short, medium and long term following climate scenarios.
▪ Advanced models: Santander performs internal climate scenario analysis and stress tests using a platform acquired from an external vendor, which follows a UNEP FI methodology supplemented with external information and scenario expansion. The platform is complemented by the materiality assessment exercises and heatmaps related to physical and transition risk.

Metrics and targets. 
Santander aims to achieve net zero carbon emissions within its own operations and customers’ financed emissions by 2050, focusing initially on the most material sectors to climate risk like power generation, and oil and gas. We’ve been publishing the PACTA analysis of our power generation portfolio since 2019.
In April, Santander became a founding member of the Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA). We committed to set and disclose decarbonization targets for the most GHG intensive sectors. In 2022, we will engage with NZBA working groups to help set specific guidance and further develop NZBA guidelines.
We disclose performance data on scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions (see 'Environmental footprint'), along with other climate relevant metrics (e.g. energy consumption). We also report on our renewables and carbon neutrality targets.
We have been carbon neutral in our own operations since 2020 by reducing and offsetting own emissions and increasing the use of renewable energy.
Regarding our scope 3 emissions (category 15 related to financing), we began to disclose the financed emissions from our customers in 2021, following the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF, which we became a member of in September 2021) standard. This means we can assess the GHG emissions linked to our portfolios and devise alignment strategies. We are setting alignment strategies and practical decarbonization targets using emissions data from our customers, which need to be accurate enough to monitor real progress. We are working on improving these data through external databases and model developments using information from our customers.
As we set and publish future decarbonization targets, we will disclose financed emissions progressively starting with the most concerning sectors, in line with the roadmap described below.
Beyond portfolio alignment, we are also working to obtain financed emissions for our balance sheet, albeit with lower-quality emissionsrelated data to support also different disclosure requirements.
Below we provide information about our third PACTA exercise and more details about decarbonization targets as part of our TCFD disclosures.
Portfolio Alignment Santander publicly supports the Paris Agreement on climate change. We joined the UN Collective Commitment to Climate Action (CCCA) when it was launched in September 2019. We announced our ambition to be net zero in carbon emissions by 2050 in our 2020 Annual Report. We were founding members of the NZBA in April 2021 to help us progress in our net zero ambition.
The most carbon-intensive sectors for Santander, as identified in the climate materiality assessment, are power generation, oil and gas, transport and mining and metals. We analysed how our customers in those sectors are positioned in terms of current and expected emissions from their activities to align with the Net Zero pathway towards 2050.
Progress on the Collective Commitment to Climate Action To fulfil UNEP FI Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) commitments, we need to set and publish sector-specific, scenario- based targets to align our portfolio with the Paris Agreement goals.
We follow NZBA guidelines and recommendations and consider our climate materiality assessment to prioritize the most carbon intensive sectors where data and methodologies are available.
Our methodology relies on financial information from our customers (total equity, total debt, total assets, company valuation, etc.), as well as emissions and production data. Where no public emissions data exist, we estimate emissions based on a proxy (average emissions by industry, country, etc.). Once we have an idea of our customers' total emissions, we can apply our attribution factor in line with the PCAF approach to determine the emissions Santander financed.
Roadmap for delivery on Net Zero The ambition for many sectors to have net zero emissions by 2050 depends on several exogenous factors. Data and methodologies need to be more widely available and reliable before we can accurately measure emissions and set decarbonization targets.
For the most concerning sectors identified in the materiality assessment (power, oil and gas, mining and metals, and transport), we’ve been measuring the GHG emissions from our customers’ activities and Santander's share of emissions, per PCAF guidelines. Those sectors are considered to have more GHG emissions directly or indirectly linked to their activities and value chains as well as the most potential to reduce emissions and help achieve the Paris Agreement goals.
We plan to set decarbonization targets based on emissions metrics for: oil and gas, mining and metals (coal-related) and aviation within our transport portfolio by September 2022 or earlier in line with our NZBA commitment. Those decarbonization targets must be compatible with helping our customers transition to a greener economy.
Subject to the availability of data and methodology, we will set decarbonization targets for mortgages, commercial real estate, auto manufacturing, auto lending, cement, agriculture and some subsectors before the end of March 2024.

A. Corporate Economy: The aggregate/combined production of all assets in the Asset Resolution's database, which captures approximately 70% of total world CO2 emissions (CO2 is the largest greenhouse gas (GHG) contributor to human induced climate change). Considering the inclusion of other GHG (such as nitrous oxide and methane – relevant in agriculture), the database captures approximately 60% of total GHG emissions. Based on data from the 2018 World Energy Outlook from the International Energy Agency.
Power generation We're committed to aligning our power generation portfolio with 

 

 

 

 the Paris Agreement by 2030.
We're ending financial services to power generation clients by 2030 if over 10% of their revenue depends on thermal coal.
Power generation is responsible for a significant part of the anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions causing global temperatures to rise. The power sector relies on technological alternatives that produce varying levels of emissions: coal, oil and gas-fired power plants produce significantly high emissions as opposed to renewable energy sources (wind and solar). Therefore, the technology mix of our power generation clients – and of our portfolio – is significant.
As of June 2021, our SCIB power generation portfolio total exposure including corporates and project finance was around EUR 34.7 billion. Our project finance portfolio in renewables accounted for EUR 11 billion.
As explained above, the technology mix of our power generation corporate clients is key to track our progress on reducing emissions. We conducted a PACTA exercise, as we had done last year, to calculate the technology mix of our SCIB corporate clients in the power generation sector (as shown in the graph above). The percentage of production capacity of renewables financed by Santander grew 2.92 percentage points and coal fell 2.46 points. Gas technology increased 3.36 points, offsetting the -4.09 p.p. reduction in coal and hydro technology, which was mainly due to intense droughts in Brazil.
We estimated the current and future emissions of our power generation portfolio and proposed the first GHG decarbonization targets for 2025 and 2030.
In setting our targets, we considered the expected trajectory of our portfolio and how it compares with the latest recognized scenario to achieve net zero emissions by 2050: “International Energy Agency (IEA) – Net Zero Emissions”. We based the pathway on the SDA and the convergence ambition approach. The SDA assumes global convergence of key sector’ emissions intensity by 2050.
Based on 2019 portfolio data, the emissions intensity of our power generation portfolio stands at 0.23 tCO2e/MWh. Our commitment is to reduce it to 0.18 tCO2e/MWh by 2025, and to 0.11 tCO2e/ MWh by 2030, in line with the Paris Agreement.
Gas will play a relevant role in the transition of power generation in many countries, enabling them to avoid using more polluting production alternatives (such as coal-fired power plants) while deploying renewables capacities in line with their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). That's why we're drawing up internal guidance for acceptable gas power generation projects to work with, aimed at reducing the GHG of our portfolios. Our approach aims to support a fair transition in those countries and including the general energy market situation of that country; energy mix pathway (based on NDCs); to lower average emissions of the energy-mix in the geography so it replaces production assets with higher emission levels; the use of advanced, low-emissions technology; and, in developed economies, preparedness to transition in the future (Hydrogen readiness; carbon capture modules; etc).

Responsible Corporate Economic and Risk management Contents banking governance financial review and compliance. 
Coal In February 2021, in our 2020 Annual Report we committed to cutting our worldwide exposure to thermal coal mining to zero by 2030.
To meet the coal targets, in 2021 we did the following: • Customer engagement: In 2021 we engaged with our customers impacted by the two coal decarbonization targets to analyse and assess their coal exit-plans. There are only 7 coal-mining customers (representing €4bn in risk exposure) and only 18 power generation customers with more than 10% revenues coming from thermal coal (representing €3bn in risk exposure, with an average weighted revenue from coal of 34.8%). In our engagement we are offering them help to transition and decarbonize. The majority of the customers we engaged with have transition plans and are receiving our support to close, transform or divest the coal mines or coal-fired power plants.
• Risk Appetite: We set new limits to monitor and manage our exposure to customers impacted by our coal commitments. These limits will ensure we meet the two coal decarbonization targets by 2030, although the exposure to these customers may not have a linear decreasing trend as we work with them to help them decarbonize.
• Environmental, social and climate change risk policy: We outlined new criteria regarding thermal coal to ensure the decarbonization of our portfolios (for more details, see the 'Risk management' section).
• Long-term incentives: We added the power generation portfolio decarbonization target (% of emissions intensity reduction for power generation) to the remuneration scheme for Santander's most senior executives (for more details, see the 'Remuneration' section).
Oil and gas The oil and gas sector represents a significant amount of the GHG emissions produced worldwide, and needs a clear transition pathway to decarbonize. Many economic activities (power generation, transport, manufacturing, etc.) are still heavily dependent on oil and gas.
The risk limits for SCIB oil and gas customers have been adjusted to consider their climate change transition plans. As a result, a tiering has been established and risk management limits have been modified accordingly, while a strict monitoring of transition plans' execution is being implemented. Further actions and levers are being explored within the current work to set alignment targets for this sector.
In early 2022, we updated the ESCC risk policy to include new restrictions that will help us decarbonize our oil and gas portfolio, which prohibits financing and advising on new oil upstream clients, except for transactions for the specific financing of renewable energy, and direct financing of oil upstream greenfield projects.
Mortgages and Real estate This sector is material to Santander's exposure. Residential and commercial buildings generate a significant amount of GHG emissions, given their overall energy consumption in this sector adds up to a significant amount of GHG emissions. Accounting for the emissions associated to the collaterals and assets that Santander finances requires extensive data collection (energy efficiency labels, property surface area in sqm, etc.).
To fulfil our net zero ambition within this sector, we're progressing with the most material portfolios to assess the emissions baseline with enough data quality to set decarbonization pathways, strategies and effective commercial plans. We're working on our mortgage portfolios in the UK and Spain, which respectively comprise over 63% and 16% of the Group's mortgage exposure.
To measure the energy efficiency of mortgage collaterals, we have been working on gathering energy performance certifications (EPC): EPCs are not comparable across geographies 4, as it is a measurement scale defined locally, and depends among other things on local policy and weather conditions. Therefore, each letter label corresponds to different levels of emissions per surface area per geography or EPC standard. In many geographies there is a significant lack of EPCs, and EPC data should be estimated with real data and supplemented with estimation models.
The first breakdown of the energy efficiency labels (EPCs) of UK mortgage collaterals, according to the UK's local EPC scale, is ("A" being the best performance, and "G" the worst): "B" for 13%,"C" for 23%, "D" for 42%, "E" for 17%, "F" for 4%, "G" for 1%.
At Santander España, the estimations of the portfolio EPC distribution, according to the Spain's EPCs local scale, is: "A" for 1% ,"B" for 2%,"C" for 4%, "D" for 14%, "E" for 63%, "F" for 8%, "G" for 8%.
Both in the UK and Spain the breakdown of EPCs in our mortgage portfolio are broadly aligned with each geography EPCs' profile.
Transport The automotive sector is material to the bank's exposure and emissions. SCF's Consumer business division is working on assessing the carbon footprint of our auto-loan portfolios. In H2'21, SCF UK began measuring 'green assets' financed within the portfolio and created a CO2 emissions financed dashboard that identifies the green assets financed. We're helping auto-manufacturers invest in new technologies to produce more efficient vehicles and reduce the average grCO2/km of the ones they produce. We'll also set an alignment target as part of our NZBA commitment and will be analysed along with auto lending as the two are related. (Please see the agreement signed with Ferrari below)
Aviation is also a relevant sub-sector that accounts for a significant amount of emissions within the transport sector. We're assessing transition plans and carbon footprint to set decarbonization targets by September 2022.
4 According to PCAF databases, as an example, the "D" EPC rating in England has an estimated emissions intensity of 0.03045 tCO2/m2, while the "E" EPC rating in Spain has an estimated emissions intensity of 0.023739 tCO2/m2.

Metals Metals manufacturing, which produces a significant amount of GHG emissions should be decarbonize replacing some of the current technologies used for combustion and electricity.
We have been assessing our steel and iron portfolio to understand its level of emissions and decarbonization plans. It is on the right track towards net zero. As indicated in our target roadmap published in our Climate finance report, we will be publishing our target for that sector no later than September 2022.
Though we have few customers and a very little exposure to aluminium. We'll keep working with our customers in that subsector to help them decarbonize their operations.
Agriculture Agriculture is a key sector on the path to net zero; however, it is also one of the most challenging in terms of data and alignment methodologies. We participate alongside other major banks in the Banking for Impact on Climate in Agriculture (B4ICA) initiative coordinated by WBCSD in partnership with UNEP FI and PCAF.
NZBA and GFANZ engagement and the collective commitment to climate action. 
We remain engaged with the UNEP FI on climate. Since 2018, we have participated in TCFD recommendations pilots I & II, making headway with an internal methodology to assess climate changerelated impacts on our credit risk exposures. As part of the Collective Commitment to Climate Action and the Net Zero Banking Alliance, we participate in working groups aimed at strengthening the initiative and further developing other initiatives.
We're also in the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), which is the umbrella organization for the finance industry from the 2021 COP in Glasgow and beyond. Our Group Executive Chair is a member of the Principals Group that sets the strategic direction for GFANZ.

As one of the world’s largest banks we have a responsibility and an opportunity to support the green transition and encourage more people and businesses to go green. Enhancing our sustainable finance proposition across all our divisions and regions is critical to meet our climate ambition. To help us achieve this, we developed in 2021 the Sustainable Finance Classification System (SFCS), an internal guide that enables us to recognize sustainable finance activities and measure them consistently throughout the Group.
Corporate and Investment Banking Building on our strong track record of renewable energy finance and advisory services, SCIB aims to introduce ESG and sustainability into all sectors and products in response to increasing demand from corporates and investors and in pursuit of Santander's own commitments. Our ambition is to become the leading financial platform for energy transition-enabling technologies by supporting our clients in achieving their sustainability objectives and transitioning towards more responsible, social and environmentally sustainable business models.
In 2021, SCIB appointed a Global Head of ESG. The team is focused on three main areas: • ESG solutions, covering ESG analytics, sustainable capital markets/ financing and ESG product development • Corporate Finance • ESG Factories, to partner with the Group’s businesses to develop specific solutions for other segments.
Financing renewable energies For the last 10 years, we've been leading the banking industry in renewable energy finance. We are among the top 3 banks in terms of number of deals and the top 5 in deal value globally.
The greenfield renewable energy projects that we have financed or advised in 2021 have a total installed capacity of 13,604 MW, and prevent the emission of 251 million tons of CO2 A. We also helped expand, improve and maintain renewable energy brownfield projects that have a total installed capacity of 1,776 MW (more details in the graphs below).
Our renewable energy greenfield and brownfield portfolio totalled more than EUR 12.9 billion by the end of the year. Spread over 326 transactions, it accounts for approximately half of our project finance portfolio.

Sustainable finance classification system (SFCS)
Sustainable finance is key to meeting our ambition to be net zero by 2050. That’s why we developed our Sustainable finance classification system (SFCS), an internal guide that outlines harmonized criteria to consider an asset green, social or sustainable in all the Group’s units and businesses. The SFCS, reviewed by Sustainalytics, draws on such international industry guidelines, standards and principles as the EU Taxonomy, ICMA, LMA Principles, UNEP FI framework and Climate Bond Standards.
It also ensures a consistent approach to sustainable finance across Santander that will enable us to track activities, support product development, mitigate the risk of greenwashing and reinforce our transparency and commitment to promote and increase our green, social and sustainability-linked activity.

Information about Article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation. 
In 2020, the European Parliament adopted the Taxonomy Regulation. It identifies activities deemed sustainable. It states that companies subject to the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD), including financial corporations, must disclose how operations align with the Taxonomy. The primary indicator of alignment is the green asset ratio (GAR), which companies must publish from 2024. It shows the extent to which financed activities meet the Taxonomy’s technical standards. 7 It’s the ratio of an entity’s Taxonomy aligned assets to balance sheet assets (excluding exposure to sovereigns, central banks and the trading portfolio).
The ratio numerator comprises exposure to these four portfolios: 1.Financial corporations.
2.Non-financial corporations.
3.Households.
4.Local governments.
From 2022, companies must make their eligibility ratio public before calculating and publishing the GAR in 2024. The eligibility ratio is calculated like the GAR. The only difference is that the eligibility ratio numerator covers activities included in the Taxonomy but doesn’t determine if they meet the technical criteria that it establishes to consider an activity "green" (environmentally sustainable).
The European Commission has two approaches to calculate the eligibility ratio: mandatory reporting based on information that is publicly disclosed by counterparties; and voluntary reporting, which is an estimate based on proxies when no information about eligibility has been made public by counterparties.
Taking into account its definition, the eligibility ratio has the following limitations: – Because the numerator and denominator consider different portfolios, it is not possible to reach 100% eligibility. The numerator covers minor exposure because it doesn’t include certain portfolios the denominator does.
– The EU Taxonomy does not currently cover every activity that companies perform and banks finance. Therefore, financed activities that it does not assess (e.g. activities under one of the four other environmental objectives in the future) will only be included in the ratio's denominator. Furthermore, activities not included in the Taxonomy are not necessarily deemed harmful to the environment or unsustainable. They are not included because of the Taxonomy’s current scope.
This report provides a ratio calculated exclusively on the household portfolio (which includes home equity loans, building renovation loans and auto loans), plus a voluntary ratio with proxies about the remaining portfolios: financial corporations, non-financial corporations and local governments. We consider proxies to meet, in the best possible way, the requirements of the Disclosures Delegated Act published in December and the FAQs the European Commission published on 20 December 2021 and 2 February 2022, and make interpreting them easier. We will broaden the scope of mandatory reporting as more data from our counterparties becomes available.
As of this report’s publication date, no public information is available about our customers’ eligibility ratios. 8 We supplemented the mandatory approach with a voluntary approach to offer the most complete eligibility ratio estimation possible.
7 For now, the EU Taxonomy covers only two environmental objectives (climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation). However, in order to quality as substantially contributing to these two objectives, the activity must cause no significant harm to the remaining four environmental objectives pending to be developed by the EU Taxonomy (sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources; transition to a circular economy; pollution prevention and control; and protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems). Additionally, minimum social safeguards criteria must be met8 The requirement to disclose the ratio of Taxonomy-based eligible and non-eligible economic activities will take effect for financial and non-financial corporations at the same time. Therefore, as of this report’s publication date, we do not have information from non-financial corporations.

How did we calculate our proportion of eligible activities? 9. 
Santander's eligibility ratio is 35% according to mandatory reporting and 43% according to voluntary reporting; however, our balance sheet’s potential eligibility ratio is 74%.
Numerator To meet regulatory requirements, we calculated two numerators:
Mandatory reporting: includes information on the household loan portfolio (residential property loans, building renovation loans and vehicle loans).
Voluntary reporting: supplements the initial calculation with Santander's exposures to local governments and to financial and non-financial corporations. It includes non-financial corporations that are subject to, or exempt from, the Non-Financial Information Disclosure Directive, in line with the considerations of the Platform on Sustainable Finance 10 on voluntary reporting.
In voluntary reporting, we apply these proxies to exposures: – Financial corporations: We only consider 5% of our global exposure, based on the European Central Bank's Investments in EU taxonomy-eligible activities, EU-taxonomy-aligned activities and activities exposed to transition risk study.
– Non-financial corporations: We consider eligible 33% of our exposure to non-financial corporations subject to the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD) and 23% to those not subject to it. We came up with this proxy based on counterparty data in our internal records.
Denominator Pursuant to the Disclosures Delegated Act, we calculated the eligibility ratio for 90% of the balance sheet. The 10% excluded comprises exposure to sovereign debt, central banks and the trading book.
Eligibility ratios As explained above, the mandatory ratio, which is the household exposures in the numerator divided by the denominator, as required by the Disclosures Delegated Act, is 35%.
The voluntary ratio, which includes exposures to financial and nonfinancial corporations and to local governments to supplement that mandatory quotient, is 43%. In addition, exposure to the four numerator counterparties (e.g. financial corporations, non-financial corporations, households and local governments) was 74% of the balance sheet (over the previously mentioned 90%).
9 Article 10.3 (d) of the Disclosures Delegated Act: To meet EU Taxonomy disclosure obligations, we reviewed our activities according to Article 10 of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178 of 6 July 2021 (the “Disclosures Delegated Act”). The information we disclosed within the scope of prudential consolidation in accordance with Title II, Chapter 2, Section 2 of Regulation (EU) 575/2013 comprises the full balance sheet for the 2021 fiscal year. 10 The platform takes the place of the Technical Expert Group (TEG) on Sustainable Finance. Under Art. 20 of the Taxonomy Regulation, it will advise the EC on implementing technical selection criteria, revising the Taxonomy Regulation, drafting sustainable finance policy and dealing with social and other sustainability objectives. It will also perform monitoring tasks.

Environmental footprint. 
GRI 103-1, 103-2, 103-3. 
Santander's group-wide strategy is to reduce the ecological impact of our operations to protect and conserve our environment in line with our principles.
To ensure we correctly recognize and deal with our impact, our internal environmental management stands on these three pillars: • Reducing and offsetting CO2 emissions.
• Reducing and managing waste responsibly.
• Raising employees’ and other stakeholders’ awareness of environmental issues.
We’ve been measuring our environmental footprint (energy consumption, waste and emissions) since 2001. Since then, our strict energy efficiency and sustainability initiatives aims to ensure we have the lowest possible impact on the environment. Upon completing our Year-to-year plan (the 2015-2017 Plan and the 2019-2021 Plan) 15 : • we reduced electricity consumption by 26%; • we reduced CO2 emissions by 88%; and • we reduced paper consumption by 78%.
This significant drop in emissions was mainly due to our substantially lower electricity use and energy from renewable sources 15 .
2021 saw the end of the 2019-2021 Energy efficiency and sustainability plan Santander had executed, with projects to improve energy consumption; use raw materials in buildings; optimize space; and raise employees' awareness of the importance of reducing our environmental footprint inside and outside the office. That plan alone reduced our electricity consumption 4% and our atmospheric emissions by 2%.
We're working on our 2022-2025 energy efficiency and sustainability plan. Some of its +90 measures are: • using more renewable energy (mainly solar) through selfconsumption installations and long-term purchase agreements under which Santander is the end consumer; • purchasing renewable electricity in every country where it's possible to certify its origin 16; • installing the latest temperature control and highlighting technology at our branches and office buildings;
Carbon offset projects. 
Reforestation in Proyecto Galicia Oaxaca III 35-year project in Borela 120 MW wind farm in (Pontevedra), Spain to Juchitán de Zaragoza, reforest 78.34 hectares of Oaxaca on the Isthmus of land with native species. Tehuanetepec in Mexico.
• optimizing our use of space; • creating more parking spaces at our buildings for electric and plugin hybrid vehicles, and subsidizing electricity costs for our employees; • using ISO 14001 as the basis for our environmental policies and objectives to reduce consumption, waste and emissions; • obtaining LEED or BREEAM certification for our buildings; and • raising awareness among employees in our 10 core markets (where we can confirm our electricity comes from renewable sources).
All of those measures are consistent with Santander's public commitment to be carbon neutral from 2020 by investing in emissions offsetting projects and by sourcing 100% of its electricity from renewable energy.
Carbon neutral In 2021, Santander set an ambitious goal to achieve carbon neutrality in all our internal operations. After, we offset the rest of emissions we were not able to cut, and each subsidiary was responsible to pay its share of emissions. In 2021, we selected four projects that obtained enough carbon credits to offset the Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions we could not previously reduce through other means.
They cover renewable energy and reforestation, and are certified under some of the industry's most well-known standards. The Group brought together its core subsidiaries and several areas to demonstrate its strong commitment to reducing its ecological footprint and fighting climate change.
Use of energy from renewable sources 75% of the energy our buildings consume comes from renewable sources; in Germany, Spain, Mexico, Portugal and the UK, that figure is 100%. We continue working on achieving 100% group-wide by 2025.
By buying green energy, we reduced emissions from electricity consumption by 56% and total emissions by 37%.

Implementation and certification of Environmental Management Systems. 
An environmental management system can make sure a building's ecological impact is being handled properly. Santander aims to get the main buildings that it occupies in its core markets ISO 14001certified. 17. 
Santander also has these certifications: ▪ LEED PLATINUM for three buildings in Poland: Atrium I, Warszawa Atrium II and Business Garden Poznan.
▪ LEED GOLD for 10 buildings in Germany (Santander Platz and An der Welle 5), Brazil (Torre Santander and the Campinas data processing centres), Spain (Tripark, Abelias, Luca de Tena and the Santander North data centre) and Poland (Robotnicza, 11 Street).
• Zero Waste for the Santander Group City and for the first time, in the headquarters of Santander España.
Other buildings are also being reviewed for similar certifications.
Other initiatives 18. 
In 2020, we began to remodel our Pereda and Hernán Cortés buildings in the city of Santander. Both buildings’ design achieved BREEAM certification.
We installed 150 additional electric car charging stations at our corporate centre, the Santander Group City in Boadilla del Monte (Madrid, Spain), bringing our total to 340. In Portugal, UK, and the US some of our buildings also have electric car charging stations.

Single-use plastics As part of our public responsible banking commitments, we also set out to remove all unnecessary single-use plastic from offices and buildings in our core markets in 2021. By the end of the year, we had achieved that aim and are now guaranteeing that the materials used in the Group's dining areas, vending machines and delivery service are environmentally friendly.
Climate awareness. 
Santander organizes local and global awareness campaigns to impress on employees the importance of reducing consumption and waste. Each subsidiary posts news and topics of interest relating to the environment and the Group's environmental initiatives on their internal portals.
For the twelfth year running, we took part in the Earth Hour, switching off the lights at our most emblematic buildings.

Sílvio Neves. 
Sílvio Neves, from Icoaraci in Belém, Pará state (Brazil), has been an artisan for 45 years. His products include traditional ceramic vases, which cost between BRL 10 and 350. He makes them in a wooden shed, where he couldn't install a kiln to finish production.
"I used to have to travel far to get access to a kiln, but then I managed to get a loan", says Sílvio. "With the loan from Prospera, he replaced the wooden shed with stone and installed the kiln."
The loan came in 2021, when a micro-finance agent knocked on his door offering financing. With other professionals from the Icoaraci Artisans Association, BRL 20,000 was raised, and half of the amount went to Silvio to remodel his space.
"I had tried to get loans before, but the rates were too high. Now I have one I can repay."
Luz Mary. 
Luz Mary is a single mother of three in Zipaquira, Colombia. She describes herself as a tireless fighter, and a forward-looking, optimistic person. She owns livestock and needed financing to cure her cattle of illness. She turned to Prospera to get a line of credit and continue her business.
When Luz Mary talks about Prospera, she tells of the trust and friendship between her and the people who work there. She says "I can only say thank you to Banco Santander for checking on me and being this supportive, and thank you, life, for letting me meet such charming people."
Virginia Álvarez Castillo. 
Virginia lives in Valle del Chalco, Estado de México. When demand fell as the pandemic broke out, she had to give up selling shoes from a catalogue.
Thanks to Tuiio, she became a seamstress and started making and selling masks at MXN 15 each, helping her overcome the economic hardship the Covid crisis had caused.
Furthermore, Virginia's new job enabled her to deal with a greater loss: her parents. Now, she dreams of having a bigger business. About Tuiio, she says: "If it were a person, I would say to them "Thanks, friend. Thank you for supporting me when I needed it most".
Feliciana José Albino. 
Feliciana is an indigenous woman who lives the Agua Zarca region in Pueblo Nuevo, Mexico. Thanks to Tuiio's financial education tool, she is able to bring help with savings to her community in their native language, Mazahua.

- Employment: Connection with professional (internships or employment) and networking opportunities with companies through competitions, fairs and other events.
The Universia Jobs platform (https://jobs.universia.net/) has more than 9,000 registered companies and 139 universities with a combined 2 million enrolled students.
In 2021, the first Universia Virtual Employability Fair was held in Spain and Portugal, with 59 stands where companies and academic institutions promoted their job and learning opportunities.
We received more than 6,700 registrations for the event, which brought together talented people, instructors and employers to engage in direct dialogue through 22 separate talks.
Universia also organised the Universia STEAM+: eSports Competition, where Banco Santander, Atresmedia, Iberdrola, Indra, Naturgy, Nestlé and Securitas Direct were able to unearth fresh talent by testing the digital and interpersonal skills of almost 1,600 young people in an innovative environment.

The figure of revenues from intra-group transactions with other tax jurisdictions includes interest income, interest expenses, commission income and commission expenses for transactions between Group companies with residence in different tax jurisdictions, as well as intra-group income which elimination is reflected in the total income of the consolidated income statement as the counterparty expense is recorded in another item of the consolidated income statement not included in total income. B. Tangible assets: Composed by Tangible assets and Non-current assets held for sale, as well as Inventories. C. The accrued corporate income tax is current year expense, not including deferred taxes. D. Including the information relating to a branch in the Cayman Islands with Corporate income tax accrued of EUR 97 million. E. Includes Corporate Center.
Reasons for the difference between corporate income tax accrued on profit/loss and the tax due if the statutory tax rate is applied to profit/loss before tax are mainly due the criteria for calculating taxes, which establishes temporary or permanent restrictions on the deduction of expenses, exemptions, etc., generating the corresponding differences between tax and accounting result. Thus, in addition to the temporary differences that generate deferred taxes, as main adjustments to the taxable income it should be noted the monetary correction in Chile and Mexico, the hyperinflation adjustments in Argentina, the deduction of juros and taxes on margins in Brazil and in some cases, such as in Poland, permanent adjustments due to non-deductible expenses like Bank Levy or some recognized provisions; with the rest of the Group's relevant jurisdictions at rates close to their nominal rates.

A. The scope of information includes the main countries of operation: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Germany, Mexico, Poland, Portugal, Spain, United Kingdom and United States (excluding Puerto Rico and Miami). B. The decrease in consumption levels was partly due to the extension of the pandemic situation during the year, which has kept the occupancy of offices and branches at low levels throughout 2021, in contrast to the previous year, 2020, which recorded normal occupancy levels during the first months of that year. This was also the result of the Group's efforts to promote savings in the consumption of resources, especially paper. C. Information is provided exclusively on water withdrawal from the public network. D. It is also reported that the external energy consumption resulting from employee travel and business trips has been: 500,311GJ in 2021 and 579,155 GJ in 2020. E. The figure for total paper and certified or recycled paper for 2020 has been recalculated from that published in 2020 report, based on information provided by the USA. F. The data for 2019 and 2020 do not include waste from the commercial network in Brazil. The amount of paper and cardboard waste reported is managed in its entirety by authorised waste managers and is collected separately, which guarantees its proper recycling. Grupo Santander will work in the near future to ensure that all this waste undergoes recycling operations. G. The increase in managed paper and board waste is mainly a consequence of the branch concentration process carried out in the Spanish branch network in 2021. H. These emissions include those derived from the direct consumption of energy (natural gas and diesel, and additionally, in the particular case of Mexico, gasoline and diesel for automobiles and LPG) and correspond to scope 1, defined by the GHG Protocol standard. To calculate these emissions, the emission factors DEFRA 2021 for 2021 and DEFRA 2020 for 2020 were applied I. The slight increase between 2020 and 2021 is mainly due to the implementation of measures to increase air recirculation in offices and branches in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic situation. J. These emissions include those derived from electricity consumption and correspond to the scope 2 defined by the GHG Protocol standard. In both 2021 and 2020 the IEA (International Energy Agency) emission factors for 2017 have been used. - Indirect Electricity Emissions - Market-based: zero emissions have been considered for green electricity consumed in Germany, Spain, Mexico, Portugal and UK; also, it has been considered that in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Poland and USA, part of electricity consumption is green energy. This altogether has meant a reduction of 212,190 tons of CO2 equivalent in 2021 and 153,582 in 2020. For the rest of the electrical energy consumed, the emission factor of the IEA corresponding to each country has been applied. - Indirect emissions of electricity - Location-based: the emission factor of the IEA corresponding to each country has been applied to the total electricity consumed, regardless of its source (renewable or non-renewable). K. The reduction in indirect electricity emissions has been mainly due to the increase in the purchase of green energy in 2021 in the countries that make up the G10 L. These emissions include emissions from employees travelling from central services in each country to their workplaces by individual car, collective vehicle and rail, and from employees' business travel by air and car. The distribution of employees by type of travel has been made on the basis of surveys or other estimates. The conversion factors DEFRA 2021 for 2021 and DEFRA 2020 for 2020 were used to calculate emissions from employee travel. - The number of employees travelling to work in their own vehicles was estimated taking into account only the number of parking spaces in the central services buildings in each country and the diesel/petrol consumption mix of the vehicle fleet in each country. Data on employee travel by individual vehicle from Argentina, Poland and the United Kingdom are not reported, as the information is not available. - Employees' journeys in collective vehicles were calculated on the basis of the average distance travelled by the vehicles rented by Grupo Santander for collective transport of its employees in the following countries: Germany, Brazil, the US, Spain, Mexico, Poland, Consumer and Portugal, and within the central services of Spain (CGS) - Data on business trips by car from USA Consumer are not reported, as the information is not available. - Emissions derived from the use of courier services are not included, nor are those derived from the transport of funds, nor those from any other purchase of products or services, nor those indirect ones caused by the financial services provided. M. Indirect emissions from displacement of employees have suffered a significant decrease. The main factors for this decrease are the reduction in mobility because of the covid-19 pandemic, in contrast to 2020, where the number of displacement of employees remained at normal levels at the beginning of the year. The reduced occupancy levels in 2021 have also contributed to the lower GHG emissions recorded.

Santander is a retail bank operating in 3 geographies (Europe, North America and South America) and in 10 main markets. Furthermore, we have global businesses like Santander Corporate & Investment Banking; Wealth Management & Insurance; or Santander Global Platform. Our purpose as a company is to help people and businesses prosper. Our aim is to be the best open financial services platform, by acting responsibly and earning the lasting loyalty of our people, customers, shareholders and communities. To this end, we integrate environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) criteria into our business model. Our business model is based on three pillars: ◦ Customer focus: Deepening the relationships with our customers through a simpler value proposition, superior customer experience and our digital proposition ◦ Our scale: Local scale and leadership. ◦ Diversification. Our geographic and business diversification allow us to overcome regional challenges in our footprint and business lines. Building on our technology to further strengthen our customers’ loyalty.
Our value proposition includes a broad variety of solutions. Products and services are tailored to meet the needs of our customers, taking advantage of global best practices, but adapted to local singularities. We strive to exceed our stakeholders´ expectations and carry out our activity in a responsible way.
Our activity allow us to contribute to several of the UN Sustainable Development Goals and support the Paris Agreement to fight climate change. In order to contribute effectively to their achievement, we have carried out an analysis to identify and align our strategy with the SDGs on which Banco Santander has the greatest impact. This analysis has highlighted the most relevant goals for Grupo Santander, both in terms of its activity, commitments and strategic focus, as well as the different external factors considered. We have identified three SDGs in which the Group has the greatest impact (8, 13 and 16) and eight more to which we also make a very significant contribution through our activity and our social programmes (1, 4, 5, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13 y 17) Tackling climate change is a key objective at Santander. We support the Paris Agreement goals and our ambition is to be net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Our main lines of action are: a) align our portfolio with the Paris Agreement Goals and set sector portfolio alignment targets in line with the NZBA and with the NZAMi; b) help customers transition to a low-carbon economy; c) reduce our impact on the environment by remaining carbon neutral and sourcing all our electricity from renewable energy; d) embed climate in risk management; understand and manage the sources of climate change risks in our portfolios.

Principle 2: Impact and Target Setting We will continuously increase our positive impacts while reducing the negative impacts on, and managing the risks to, people and environment resulting from our activities, products and services. To this end, we will set and publish targets where we can have the most significant impacts.
2.1. Impact Analysis:
Show that your bank has identified the areas in which it has its most significant (potential) positive and negative impact through an impact analysis that fulfills the following elements: a) Scope: The bank’s core business areas, products/services across the main geographies that the bank operates in have been as described under 1.1. have been considered in the scope of the analysis. b) Scale of Exposure: In identifying its areas of most significant impact the bank has considered where its core business/its major activities lie in terms of industries, technologies and geographies. c) Context & Relevance: Your bank has taken into account the most relevant challenges and priorities related to sustainable development in the countries/regions in which it operates. d) Scale and intensity/salience of impact: In identifying its areas of most significant impact, the bank has considered the scale and intensity/salience of the (potential) social, economic and environmental impacts resulting from the bank’s activities and provision of products and services. (your bank should have engaged with relevant stakeholders to help inform your analysis under elements c) and d))
Show that building on this analysis, the bank has: • -identified and disclosed its areas of most significant (potential) positive and negative impact. • - identified strategic business opportunities in relation to the increase of positive impacts / reduction of negative impacts.
Our in-depth materiality review included direct stakeholder input (internal and external interviews and surveys on the bank’s ESG priorities), in line with best practice. Following the proposed Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and leading ESG reporting standards, we applied the principle of double materiality: (1) financial materiality (how ESG issues impact financial performance); and (2) environmental and social materiality (how ESG action impacts society and the environment). Our materiality assessment identified 15 ESG topics we should focus on. Classified in crucial, major and relevant issues. Among crucial topics are: • Customer experience and satisfaction. Supporting customers and local economies with products and services that meet their needs. Giving them services and products that are Simple, Personal and Fair. Innovating and using digital technologies to maximize access to products and services • Financial inclusion and empowerment. Designing, developing and delivering products and services that ensure access to the financial system and meet credit needs. Building resilience through financial education. • Green finance. Supporting our customers in their transition to a low carbon economy by embedding environmental factors in products and risk analyses, and by supporting the growth of sustainable financial product markets • ESG in risk management, embedding climate. Ensuring our risk management framework incorporates customers’ and operations’ environmental (e.g. climate) and social (e.g. human rights) risks, and outlining them in policies and procedures • Culture, conduct & ethical behaviours. Ensuring exemplary conduct by everybody: being Simple, Personal & Fair in all we do; and embedding Risk Pro, ethical channels and best-in-class policies and controls on employees’ internal conduct, transparency towards customers and ethical behaviour. This annual report discloses information on progress and plans relating to addressing these and other topics. In particular, in 2021: • We committed to net zero emissions by 2050. We become founding member of UNEP FI’s Net Zero Banking Alliance. And first decarbonization targets set. • We develop our Sustainable finance classification system setting the criteria to offer, manage and report sustainable financing. • We mobilized more than 32bn in green finance, and launched our third green bond raised EUR 1 billion in an eight-year non-preferred senior debt issue that will finance wind and solar power projects. • We ranked in the Top 3 in NPS in 8 markets, up from 6 in 2020. • We strengthen Santander Finance for all programme. Santander Chile, Santander Colombia and Santander Perú launched new microfinance programmes for entrepreneurs, while we continued to expand Prospera in Brazil and TUIIO in Mexico. In addition Santander Universities launched the Santander X Global Challenge | Finance For All to find innovative solutions that ensure access to banking products and services.

Additionally we updated our climate strategy, committing to: i) aligning our power generation portfolio with the Paris Agreement by 2030; ii) stop providing financial services to power generation customers with a revenue dependency on coal of over 10% in 2030; iii) reduce our worldwide exposure to coal mining production to zero by 2030; iv) and the ambition to be net zero carbon emissions by 2050. In 2021, we met (or exceeded) all our commitments for 2019-2021 and made progress on all our targets. Our new public commitments include initial decarbonization targets for the power industry for 2025 and 2030, which measure emission intensity. • Thermal coal-related power & mining phase out • Reduce emissions intensity of our power generation portfolio from 0.23 tCO2e/MWh to 0.18 tCO2e/MWh by 2025, and to 0.11 tCO2e/ MWh by 2030 • Sustainable investment: 100 billion euros in assets under management with ESG criteria by 2025. We'll continue to set decarbonization targets for the other sectors. Together with the targets for 2019-2025, they will form part of our new public commitments in the 2022-2025 agenda.

Principle 3: Clients and Customers We will work responsibly with our clients and our customers to encourage sustainable practices and enable economic activities that create shared prosperity for current and future generations.
3.1.Provide an overview of the policies and practices your bank has in place and/or is planning to put in place to promote responsible relationships with its customers.

Being responsible means offering our customers products and services that are Simple, Personal and Fair. Our product, service and consumer protection framework sets out the principles that promote a strong SPF relationship with customers and establishes the basics for managing and mitigating conduct risk in design, sales, post-sales and services. The Compliance and conduct function abides by our Consumer protection policy, which sets out the highest ethical standards we expect our teams to uphold towards customers. We report on our consumer protection principles in all our geographies to make sure we embed them in our day-to-day. We use our customers’ voice and business indicators to spot unsatisfactory customer service, fee-related issues, incidents at ATMs and other areas for improvement, and to come up with plans to address them. Our product governance forum ensures the products and services that we market meet the needs of identified target segments and are reasonably and clearly priced. In 2021, we enhanced our ESG product validation and finally, 9 proposals were validated with impact on this matter That's why all our employees undertake a mandatory, annual course on the management of conduct risks in sales and consumer protection. We run special training programmes for our sales teams to arm them with the knowledge and skills that will enable them to sell our products and services effectively. In 2021, we worked on an instruction manual about our vulnerable customer and special case management model, and set a roadmap for its roll-out among subsidiaries, therefore ensuring a consistent, group-wide approach to identifying and managing vulnerable customers in such high-impact procedures as collections and fraud management In 2021, we continued to focus on resolving complaints at the first point of contact with customers and on opening digital channels for quicker, alternative access to feedback mechanisms. We heightened the monitoring and reporting of customer issues in areas that are considered critical due to the knock-on effects of the pandemic.
All our activity is guided by policies, principles and frameworks to ensure we behave responsibly in everything we do. • The general sustainability policy sets out principles and commitments focused on adding value to our main stakeholders. • The environmental, social and climate change risk management policy details how we identify and manage risks, in oil and gas, energy, mining and metals, and in soft commodities. • The sensitive sectors policy establishes guidelines for the evaluation and decision making on participation of the Group in certain sectors, which could lead to reputational risks. We developed our sustainable finance classification system (SFCS), which sets out sustainable finance definition in the group. Consistent with this, we have a catalogue of sustainable products and a green book. We are a leader in renewable energy financing, and have a strong financial empowerment strategy - Santander Finance for All. We issued our third EUR 1 billion green bond to finance and refinance renewable wind and solar power. We're expanding our range of ESG products in Wealth Management. As of December 2021, we had over €27bn AuM.

Principle 4: Stakeholders We will proactively and responsibly consult, engage and partner with relevant stakeholders to achieve society’s goals.
4.1. Describe which stakeholders (or groups/ types of stakeholders) your bank has consulted, engaged, collaborated or partnered with for the purpose of implementing these Principles and improving your bank’s impacts. This should include a high-level overview of how your bank has identified relevant stakeholders and what issues were addressed/results achieved.
Our strategy is based on a virtuous circle centred on trust and loyalty of our employees, customers, shareholders and communities. To achieve this we promote the active listening of our stakeholders. Listening, analysing, assessing and responding to their opinions and concerns we not only identify issues, we also spot opportunities, which allows us to guarantee our activity and to maintain the right functioning of the entire value chain. In addition, we also regularly analyse the most relevant environmental, social and governance issues demands of analysts and investors. And we continuously monitor the emergence of new standards and good practice at international level. Actively participating in the consultation processes of both authorities and sectoral associations and other organizations that influence the development of relevant policies on the sustainable development agenda. We have followed closely the adoption of the Taxonomy Regulation that sets the criteria for classifying economic activities as environmentally sustainable. It also dictates the information that financial and nonfinancial companies will have to disclose about the environmental impact of their activities. As a result, we have published our banking products' eligibility under the EU Taxonomy. We also designed our Sustainable Finance Classification System to make classifying, monitoring and reporting on sustainable financing easier. It also guides our development of sustainable products and services fully in the line with our customers' expectations and the strictest market standards. We are part of the main and most important local and global initiatives to support the inclusive and sustainable growth. Some examples are: UNEP FI. We are a founding signatory to the United Nations Principles for Responsible Banking. In 2021, we continued participating in Phase III of the UNEP FI project on the TCFD's recommendations for banks. World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD). Banking Environment Initiative (BEI); UN Global Compact, CEO Partnership for Financial Inclusion; or Equator Principles. In 2021, in support of our Net Zero ambition, we joined the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, Net Zero Asset Management and were cofounders to the Net Zero Banking Alliance. Within GFANZ, we co-led the Net Zero Public Policy and their call to action launched in October. Our performance is also assessed by leading analysts and ESG indices (DJSI, MSCI, CDP, sustainalytics, ). Participating in these indices and trying to improve our position in them helps us to continuously improve our processes. In 2021 we have improved our positioning in all of them. Finally, as a consequence of our commitment to transparency, we closely monitor all developments in ESG disclosure. In January 2021 we were one of the companies committed to implementing the World Economic Forum's Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics, and as a result this year we have taken this standard into account for the first time in the preparation of our Responsible banking chapter (Consolidated Statement of NonFinancial Information).

It is expected that the appeal will be resolved by Q1 2022.

On 16 July 2021, the Territorial Delegation for Health and Families in Córdoba rendered a resolution against Openbank for the inclusion of allegedly abusive terms in mortgage loan contracts during the period 2017-2019. The Territorial Delegation alleges that the inclusion of these abusive terms may result in a serious infringement of the Defense and Protection of Consumers and Users Act 13/2003 of Andalucía. Fine: €235.000. Openbank filed an administrative appeal. The proceeding is pending to final resolution.
In 2018, the Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled that Notices of Intention to repossess or auction of a repossessed vehicles (NOIs) must expressly describe that any outstanding balance would be reduced by the “fair market value” of the vehicle; Santander Consumer USA (SC) revised its MA NOIs in September 2019. On February 2021, SC reached an agreement to resolve a putative class action filed in June 2019 alleging SC’s MA NOIs failed to expressly reference “fair market value” for $5.6 million, which was approved by the Court on 16 December. The Group Yunker class action settlement is limited to MA borrowers who did not have arbitration provisions in their contracts. On 4 June 2021, the Massachusets Attorney General issued a Civil Investigative Demand (CID) to SC seeking all NOIs provided to Massachusets residents from 30 March 2017 to the present. The parties reached an agreement in principle to resolve the matter for $5.6 million. SC expects to reach a definitive agreement, including the issuance of an Assurance of Discontinuance in the first quarter of 2022.
Sanctioning procedure received from Junta de Andalucía, alledging the establishment of abusive clauses in the contracts. SCF received the resolution on 21st of April 2021 imposing a fine of 235.000 million euros. Resolution has been appealed, and decision is pending.

Responsible Corporate Economic and Risk management Contents banking governance financial review and compliance 1. 2021 Overview 'The continuing impact of the global pandemic on our business, on our customers and on our employees, taken together with an uncertain economic and geopolitical environment, reinforces the need for Banco Santander board of directors’ constant vigilance of the management and oversight of its operations. We do this through a commitment to strong and effective governance processes to ensure that the board and management are directing Santander Group and its operations in the best interests of all our stakeholders, including shareholders, customers, employees, regulators and the communities in which we work around the world. We are also committed to playing our part in helping decarbonize the physical environment around us and reach net zero by 2050.
Santander’s sophisticated governance model is designed to ensure that it can deliver its strategic plans, while ensuring that appropriate checks and balances are in place, so that the business is, at all times, resilient and sustainable in the face of a rapidly changing set of challenges and aligned with our values. During 2021, we devoted time to reviewing the roles and responsibilities of the most senior executives, including those of the executive chair and the CEO; and the independence, integrity and robustness of Banco Santander´s control functions. Details of the governance reviews conducted in that regard are outlined in the nomination committee report. Succession planning for our board members and senior managers remains a priority and will enable us to attract and retain the diverse range of highly talented colleagues we need to lead Banco Santander.
Notwithstanding the strong performance of Santander in 2021, it is important that we are never complacent and that we continue to challenge ourselves and look to improve our governance where possible'.
Bruce Carnegie-Brown, Lead independent director 1.1 Board skills and diversity. 
The board’s composition did not change in 2021, after three years in which 47% of its members were renewed in order to boost diversity and expertise. 40% of board members are women, in line with its even representation target (of 40-60%) of both genders; and 66.67% are independent directors.
The changes in recent years have strengthened its banking, financial, technological and digital prowess; made it more diverse in terms of regional origin; and, overall, given it the right composition to lead the Group in pursuit of its strategy now and in the future.
On 24 February 2022, the board of directors nominated Germán de la Fuente Escamilla to be made a new independent director at the annual general meeting called for 31 March on first call or on 1 April on second call (2022 AGM), and fill the vacancy left by Álvaro Cardoso de Souza, who had announced he would effectively step down once a nomination was approved. See section 3.5 'Our next AGM in 2022'.
Germán de la Fuente has a solid background in auditing, accounting and the banking industry, and held senior positions at Deloitte for over 30 years.
Changes to the director category Sergio Rial has changed his classification from executive to other external (non-executive or independent) having ceased his executive functions as CEO of Banco Santander (Brazil), S.A. and regional head of South America of the Group.
Board committees The board made the following changes to the composition of its committees to further enhance their operations and support in their.

1.2 Board effectiveness. 
Covid-19 and after the pandemic In 2020, the pandemic’s unprecedented effect on health and the global economy required a rapid, coordinated and sustained response from Santander to safeguard business continuity and tackle challenges effectively. In 2021, the board and its committees carried on that effort amid recovery from the crisis.
Banco Santander’s Special situations global office (SSGO) reviewed Covid-19 management to recognize strengths in special situation governance, as well as opportunities to improve it. The board received its findings (based on feedback from core functions and external agents) and approved the improvements being made.
The exercise recognized the good practices adopted and rapid reaction capacity adopted by Banco Santander. In this sense, our management of the crisis has been recognised both externally (Euromoney award “Excellence in leadership” as best bank in the management of the crisis) and internally (95% of employees consider the crisis management to be very good). In addition, the review highlighted some areas of improvement: the relevance of the early and forward-looking threat identification, the speed-up of decision-making process and the coordination across the Group.
In addition to reviewing the special situation governance system, the board oversaw the measures taken for our stakeholders: • Employees: reorganization of the way of working (promoting the remote working) and implemented protocols and preventive measures with the aim of protecting the health of all the Group's employees.
• Customers: revamp the digital and remote channels with multiple customised solutions to help retail customers and businesses; relaxing loan conditions for people and businesses hit by the pandemic (payment holidays, grace periods); or swiftly facilitating government-backed lines of credit and other public assistance measures.
• Shareholders: hybrid and remote general meetings that shareholders could attend in person or online, and revision of the shareholder remuneration policy according to ECB recommendations.
• Society: engagement with governments and institutions to aid recovery from the crisis, including donations of urgent health equipment and supplies.
Group and subsidiary board relations Strengthening the ties between the Group's and the subsidiaries' boards of directors is key to effective oversight of policies, controls and corporate culture. In the last two years, the global pandemic heightened the need for the effective cross-border cooperation that our proven Group Subsidiary Governance Model (GSGM) facilitates. That governance model is strengthened by the presence of a number of Group non-executive directors on our subsidiary boards: Luis Isasi at Santander España; Álvaro Cardoso at Banco Santander (Brasil), S.A.; Homaira Akbari at Santander Consumer USA Holdings Inc.; and Pamela Walkden at Santander UK plc and Santander UK Group Holdings plc (having replaced Bruce Carnegie-Brown in 2021). See section 7. 'Group structure and internal governance'.
In 2021 we also continued to hold committee chair conventions across the Group. They reinforced our coordination and accentuated the benefits of cross-border cooperation.
Specifically, conventions of the audit and responsible banking, sustainability and culture committees chairs were held at the Santander Headquarters in Boadilla del Monte. The conventions aimed to foster further collaboration between countries, raise awareness about global initiatives and expectations, collectively debate current affairs and relevant operational matters, as well as encouraging networking among attendees.
Both events were successful and productive, with universal positive feedback received from participants. Our approach to holding such conventions will continue in 2022 and beyond.
Board assessment and actions to continuously improve its functioning Corporate governance is a key priority for Santander. Our governance model has consistently received strong support from shareholders, as evidenced by their high participation in general meetings and strong percentage of approval for corporate management and the reelection of the executive chair and other directors. As we are aware that governance arrangements need to adapt to contingent and forward-looking business and strategy needs, we must continuously monitor and enhance the functioning of our governance bodies.
While we are confident of the effectiveness of Santander’s governance model, we regularly assess our governance framework with the support of external advisers as required. We also review individual and collective skills to ensure the board’s competence and diversity are sufficient for it to function effectively and hold management to account through constructive challenge.
In 2020 we asked Egon Zehnder to conduct an effectiveness review of the board of directors and its committees in line with our policy to have an external party assess their annual effectiveness every three years. Egon Zehnder concluded that Santander’s board is highly effective, with recent changes in its composition resulting in a stellar set of diverse and outstanding individuals and that its governance model with the current individuals in key roles, is well designed and effectively implemented with demonstrable outcomes, as shown in the performance of Banco Santander and high satisfaction of the board members.
In addition, in 2021 we asked another external firm to execute a broader review of our governance arrangements with the aim of assessing its overall functioning and adherence of Santander’s governance model to regulations, supervisors’ expectations, and industry best practice. After an in-depth analysis, the external firm came to the conclusion that Santander has implemented a sophisticated governance model that suits its group-wide characteristics and requirements. The external firm highlighted that Santander's corporate governance is a key tool to drive the Group towards the implementation of its medium and long-term strategy,

Responsible Corporate Economic and Risk management Contents banking governance financial review and compliance while managing the BAU operations and keeping a strong control on risks. They also acknowledged the high profile of Santander’s board members as well as the diversity of board in terms of gender, geography, age and background.
Both external firms identified some areas for further improvement that contributed to an internal discussion led by the nomination committee and its chair, our lead independent director.
In view of the conclusions of both reviews, in December 2021 the board of directors approved an action plan that will further align our corporate governance arrangements with supervisors’ expectations and best industry practices. It revolves around these objectives: • Ensuring continued clarity of the role and the responsibilities of the most senior executives, including the executive chair and CEO; • Ensuring that checks and balances remain appropriate and effective; and • Ensuring that the independence of control functions remains fully preserved.
The plan will be executed in 2022 under the coordination of the general secretary and with oversight of the nomination committee and its chair.
In addition to the above-mentioned structured reviews and resultant action plan, we encourage an environment of ongoing feedback and suggestions from the board members focused on continuous improvement. In 2021, the non-executive directors, under the leadership of the lead independent director, identified the following areas for improvement: • Optimizing board time spent together and the strategic areas of board focus; and increasing engagement with the executive and younger talent pools; • Increasing board visibility of customers' and branches' needs and circumstances; • Striking the right balance between holding the executive to account and engaging with the future talent pipeline; • Optimizing the materials delivered to the board and its committees, ensuring the right balance between content and length; • Continued focus on effective coordination between the board and its committees, ensuring an appropriate distribution of workload; and • Reviewing scalable processes that could be applied across the Group more effectively, while understanding the changes required for the Group’s strategic direction being more effective.
We are confident these actions will have a lasting positive impact on our effective corporate governance. In the future, according to our commitment to continuous improvement, we will review our corporate governance arrangements on an ongoing basis, so as to ensure that they remain fully effective.
1.3 Alignment of executive compensation with the Group's strategy, investors and long-term sustainability. 
Following the entry into force of the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD V), the board revised the remuneration scheme after five years to align it with strategy, investors’ interests and long-term sustainability.
We took action to: • Introduce stock options as part of variable pay, for greater alignment with shareholder returns; • Update long-term compensation metrics, prioritizing: • Profitability and long-term value creation for Santander, applying return on tangible equity (RoTE); • Consistent total shareholder return (TSR), albeit raising the threshold above which executives begin to receive compensation for this metric from 33% to 40%; and • Sustainability, embedding an ESG metric that comprises five submetrics related to our Responsible Banking agenda.
• Reduce the short-term corporate bonus metrics from four to three: customers (30%), RoRWA (40%) and RoTE (30%) to sharpen focus on the Group’s strategic priorities of customer and profitability; and • Make these amendments to match the Group’s strategic priorities: • Executive directors’ compensation as board members of PagoNxt to be paid in PagoNxt capital instruments.
• Scope of the Digital Incentive widened to include a PagoNxt component that encourages non-PagoNxt executives to work together towards its success, and the strategic initiatives of the Digital Consumer Bank and One Santander in Europe.
1.4 Engagement with our shareholders in 2021. 
In 2021, Banco Santander interacted with shareholders under conditions still marked by the covid-19 health crisis. Combining traditional communication channels with virtual meetings and special campaigns was fundamental to remain aligned with their interests and keep their loyalty. By digitalizing to stay at the forefront of both our core activity and shareholder and investor relations, we helped some four million shareholders from all over the world engage Grupo Santander.
We focused our efforts on explaining our governance and sustainability strategy in detail. Because we understand investors are more considerate of ESG performance and the impact our operations can have on society and the environment, we give detailed explanations about how we are helping tackle inequality, climate change and other global challenges. We also engaged in open and constructive dialogue with analysts who provide investors with information about sustainability and assess our risks, actions and impact relating to ESG. We were proactive in sharing developments in our responsible banking agenda, particularly regarding climate change, and considering their feedback in our materiality analysis and work to introduce ESG into our remuneration scheme. By doing things responsibly and creating long-term environmental and social solutions to support inclusive and sustainable growth, we are able to create value for shareholders and earn their lasting loyalty.

To fight the pandemic in the countries where we operate, we took several social actions, such as providing essential health equipment and supplies. See subsection 'Covid-19 and after the pandemic' in section 1.2.
Because of the Group and its subsidiaries’ robust financial situation, we were able to maintain stable business levels and appropriate capital, liquidity and risk profile levels. We executed our risk management and control processes correctly, and our governing bodies heard regularly about the pandemic’s impact and the measures each subsidiary was taking.

Responsible Corporate Economic and Risk management Contents banking governance financial review and compliance 2021 goals. 
Strategic growth initiatives. 
Working on the Group’s strategic growth priorities, which are critical to becoming the world’s best open financial services platform.
Our initiatives include One Santander, which is a common operational and business model created to transform the way we serve our customers, providing a simpler and enhanced customer experience; PagoNxt, which is an autonomous global payment platform to combine our payments businesses and banks around the world, accelerating the deployment of payment solutions to our customers globally, and is critical to building One Santander; and the Digital Consumer Bank, integrating our fast-growing consumer lending business, Santander Consumer Finance (SCF), with Openbank to transform our digital proposition.
How we delivered. 
Our aim to become the world's best open financial services platform, building on our technology to earn customers’ lasting loyalty, was helped by the progress we made with three strategic initiatives in 2021: One Santander, PagoNxt and Digital Consumer Bank.
We laid the foundations of our transformation in Europe (One Santander), with greater connection between customer segments and higher business activity that resulted in steady growth. In 2022, we will focus on harnessing our scale to roll out a common operational and business model.
PagoNxt also became a global payment platform for all Santander customers and the open market. Its acquiring solution is already running in 6 markets, serving 1.2 million merchants; its international trade solution is already in 8 markets. Also, we launched the Payments Hub to support all our customers’ payments.
Digital Consumer Bank also registered strong financial performance and significantly increased its customer base in its push to become the largest digital consumer credit bank.
Responsible Banking – embedding ESG in all we do. 
Driving Santander’s efforts to deliver profit with a clear purpose, to help people and businesses prosper in the years ahead, and to build a more responsible bank.
Overseeing the implementation of our decisions to support the objectives of the Paris Agreement and focusing on fulfilling our commitment to raising and facilitating EUR 120 billion in green finance and to achieving the financial inclusion of 10 million people by 2025.
High governance standards. 
Maintaining high standards of governance to fulfil our strategy and ensure long-term success. This will help ensure our ongoing effectiveness and alignment with best practice.
In particular, it will continue to instil strong governance disciplines as a key enabler to effective oversight and control across the group, making sure our corporate governance framework takes into account supervisory body recommendations as well as national and international guidelines.
We met or exceeded all our 2019-2021 commitments and continued our efforts to make progress on our commitments for 2025.
On climate change, we set a goal to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050 and created our first decarbonization targets for exposures to thermal carbon and electric power generation. We became founder members of the Net Zero Banking Alliance and Santander Asset Management was the first fund manager in Spain to join the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative with a commitment to reducing emissions from assets under management by 50% by 2030. We also issued our third green bond in the amount of EUR 1 billion to finance wind and solar power projects, and expanded our range of ESG wealth management products.
Through Santander finance for all program, we’ve financially empowered more than 7 million people since 2019.
Euromoney named us “Best Bank for Sustainable Finance in Latin America” and “Best ESG Private Bank” and “Best Bank for Financial Inclusion”. Furthermore, Great Place To Work recognized us, for the third time, as one of the top 25 companies to work for. We were also the world's highest scoring bank and the second highest-scoring company in gender equality and diversity according to the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index (the 2022 index includes 418 companies from 45 countries).
For more details, see 'Responsible banking' chapter.
In 2021, an in-depth review by an external adviser indicated that Banco Santander’s corporate governance is consistent with regulation, industry best practice and the Group’s structure, conducive to effective management to implement strategy and sustain sound risk control.
Our high rankings by ESG analysts who reviewed our performance in 2021 speak to our commitment to the highest governance standards. Banco Santander also received the highest score in the Spanish Association for Standardisation and Certification's (AENOR) new Good Corporate Governance Index, which checks board structure and dynamics, transparency, sustainability and ESG oversight.
As always, this year we followed the recommendations and instructions of supervisors and national and international bodies. We reviewed the EBA’s new guidelines on internal governance and remuneration and joint guidelines with the ESMA on the assessment of the suitability of members of the management body and key function holders (released in July 2021) and are taking the measures needed to accommodate them.
In 2021 we fully complied with the total 61 recommendations that apply to us in the CNMV’s Code of Good Governance (see section '9.3 Table on compliance with, or explanations of, recommendations on corporate governance').

Responsible Corporate Economic and Risk management Contents banking governance financial review and compliance 1.6 Priorities for 2022. 
Our board’s priorities for 2022 are: • Developing strategic initiatives: One Santander, PagoNxt and Digital Consumer Bank. 
Overseeing those three strategic initiatives we launched in 2020 to help achieve our aim to be the world’s best open financial services platform, acting responsibly and earning the trust of our employees, customers, shareholders and broader society: • One Santander: A common operational and business model created to transform the way we serve our customers and provide a simpler and more enhanced customer experience; • PagoNxt: This autonomous global payment platform to integrate all Santander customers with open market includes the Payments Hub and our acquiring and international trade businesses. It will roll out payment solutions globally to our customers faster, which is critical to building One Santander; and • Digital Consumer Bank: Integrating Santander Consumer Finance (SCF) and our fast-growing auto and consumer finance businesses with Santander's digital native bank, Openbank, to boost the technological transformation of the consumer finance business and ensure profitability and growth.
• Ensuring responsible, profitable growth. 
We will continue to focus on generating profitable growth in a responsible way as a means of creating long-term value for our shareholders and other stakeholders. We will oversee the fulfilment of our ESG commitments to reach net zero emissions by 2050; raise 120 billion euros in green financing by 2025 and 220 billion euros by 2030; and financially empower 10 million people by 2025.
In 2022, we will set new short- and medium-term climate change objectives that will help us meet our long-term climate commitment.
• Strengthening governance to ensure we fulfil our long-term vision. 
We will continue to bolster our corporate governance by taking the improvement measures we identified in the 2021 review and enhancing our management bodies' operations to make sure we continue to adhere to national and international best practices and to supervisors' expectations.
• Maintaining capital discipline and creating shareholder value. 
In 2022, we will prioritize organic growth as part of our capital management, focusing on businesses with high returns on riskweighted assets (RoRWA) and shareholder remuneration.
Our shareholder remuneration policy aims to pay out 40% of 2022 underlying profit, split in approximately equal measure between a cash dividend and a share buyback.

Under Spanish law, only shareholders at the general meeting have the authority to increase share capital. However, they may delegate the authority to approve or execute capital increases to the board of directors. Our By-laws are fully aligned with Spanish law and do not establish any different conditions for share capital increases.
As of 31 December 2021, our board of directors had received authorization from shareholders to approve or carry out the following capital increases: • Authorized capital to 2023: at our April 2020 AGM, the board was authorised to increase share capital on one or more occasions by up to EUR 4,154,528,645.50 (50% of capital at the time of the April 2020 AGM or approximately 8.3 billion shares representing 47.86% of the share capital at 31 December 2021). The board was granted this authorization for three years (until 3 April 2023).
Consequently, the board can issue shares for cash consideration with or without pre-emptive rights for shareholders, and for capital increases to back any convertible bonds or securities issued under its authority granted by the April 2020 AGM.
Shares without pre-emptive rights under this authority can be issued up to EUR 830,905,729 (10% of capital at the time of the April 2020 AGM or approximately 1,661 million shares representing 9.57% of the share capital at 31 December 2021). However, when Law 5/2021 of 12 April, amending the revised Spanish Companies Act and other financial regulation in regard to the fostering of long-term shareholder engagement by listed companies (Act 5/2021) came into force, this limit on issuing shares without pre-emptive rights does not apply to capital increases to convert CCPS (which shall be converted into newlyissued shares when the CET1 ratio falls below a predetermined threshold). To date, this authorization has been used for the three CCPS issues executed in 2021.
The board of directors is proposing to have this authority renewed at our 2022 AGM. See section 3.5 'Our next AGM in 2022'.

Responsible Corporate Economic and Risk management Contents banking governance financial review and compliance • Capital increases approved for contingent conversion of CCPSs: we issued contingent convertible preferred securities that qualify as regulatory Additional Tier 1 (AT1) instruments and would be converted into newly-issued shares if the CET1 ratio fell below a predetermined threshold. Each issue is therefore backed by a capital increase approved under the authorization granted to the board by shareholders. The chart below shows the outstanding CCPSs at the time of this report, with details about the capital increase resolutions that back them. These capital increases are therefore contingent and have been delegated to the board of. 
ISSUES OF CONTINGENT CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED SECURITIES directors. The board of directors is authorised to issue additional CCPSs and other convertible securities and instruments in accordance with the annual general meeting held on 12 April 2019 resolution that allows convertible instruments and securities to be issued for up to EUR 10 billion or an equivalent amount in another currency (three issues were executed in 2021 under this authorization, as shown in the table below). Any capital increase to allow any such CCPS or other convertible instruments or securities to be converted would be approved under the authority which each issue was executed.

The figure corresponds to the maximum number of shares that could be required to cover the conversion of these CCPS, calculated as the quotient (rounded off by default) of the nominal amount of the CCPS issue divided by the minimum conversion price determined for each CCPS (subject to any antidilution adjustments and the resulting conversion ratio).
2.3 Significant shareholders. 
At 31 December 2021, no shareholder held more than 3% of Banco Santander’s total share capital (which is the threshold generally provided under Spanish regulations for a significant holding in a listed company to be disclosed). Even though at 31 December 2021, certain custodians appeared in our shareholder registry as holding more than 3% of our share capital, we understand that those shares were held in custody on behalf of other investors, none of whom exceeded that threshold individually. These custodians were State Street Bank (13.35%), Chase Nominees Limited (9.15%),The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (5.21%), Citibank New York (3.74%) and EC Nominees Limited (3.34%).
On 24 October 2019 BlackRock Inc., asset manager, reported to the CNMV its significant holding of voting rights in Banco Santander (5.426% of share capital at 24 October 2019). It also specified that it was holding shares on behalf of a number of funds or other investment entities, none of which exceeded 3% individually. In addition, on 21 February 2022, Amundi, S.A., another asset manager, reported to the CNMV its significant holding of voting rights in Banco Santander (3.007% of share capital), while it specifies that the corresponding shares are held by investment funds managed by management entities controlled by Amundi, S.A., none of which exceeds 3% individually. No other changes have been communicated since 31 December 2021. There may be some overlap in the holdings declared by the above mentioned custodians and asset managers.
At 31 December 2021, neither our shareholder registry nor the CNMV's registry showed any shareholder residing in a noncooperative jurisdictions with a shareholding equal to, or greater than, 1% of our share capital (which is the other threshold applicable under Spanish regulations).
Our Bylaws and the Rules and regulations of the board of directors lay down an appropriate system for analysing and approving relatedparty transactions with significant shareholders. See section 4.12 'Related-party transactions and conflicts of interest'. 2.4 Shareholders’ agreements. 
In February 2006, various persons linked to the Botín-Sanz de Sautuola y O’Shea family entered into a shareholders’ agreement that set up a syndicate for their shares in Banco Santander. CNMV was informed of this agreement and the subsequent amendments the parties made. This information can be found on the CNMV website.
The main provisions of the agreement are: • Transfer restrictions: except when the transferee is also a party to the agreement or the Fundación Botín, any transfer of Banco Santander shares expressly included in the agreement requires prior authorization from the syndicate meeting, which can freely authorise or reject it. These transfer restrictions apply to the shares they expressly cover under the agreement and to shares subscribed for, or acquired by, syndicate members in exercising any subscription, bonus share, grouping or division, replacement, exchange or conversion rights that pertain or are attributed to, or derive from, those syndicated shares.
• Syndicated voting: under the agreement, the parties will syndicate and pool the voting rights attached to all their shares in Banco Santander, so that syndicate members may exercise them and, in general, act towards Banco Santander in a concerted manner, in accordance with the instructions and indications and the voting criteria and orientation established by the syndicate. This covers the shares subject to the transfer restrictions mentioned above as well as any voting rights attached to any other Banco Santander shares held either directly or indirectly by the parties to the agreement, and any other voting rights assigned to them by virtue.

For this purpose, representation of the syndicated shares is attributed to the chair of the syndicate, who will be the chair of the Fundación Botín (currently, Javier Botín, one of our directors and our Group executive chair's brother).
The agreement initially terminates on 1 January 2056, but will be automatically extended for additional 10-year periods unless one of the parties notifies of their intention not to extend six months before the initial term or extension period ends. The agreement may only be terminated early if all the syndicated shareholders agree unanimously.
At 31 December 2021, the parties to the shareholders' agreement held 100,784,838 shares in Banco Santander (0.58% of its capital), which were therefore subject to the voting syndicate. They include 80,355,819 shares (0.46% of its capital) that are also subject to the transfer restrictions.
Subsection A.7 of section 9.2 'Statistical information on corporate governance required by the CNMV' contains the list of parties to the shareholders´ agreement and the relevant information filed with CNMV.
2.5 Treasury shares. 
Shareholder approval The acquisition of treasury shares was last authorized at our April 2020 AGM, for five years and subject to the following provisions: • Treasury shares held at any time cannot exceed 10% of Banco Santander's share capital, which is the legal limit set under the Ley de Sociedades de Capital (Spanish Companies Act).
• The purchase price cannot be lower than the nominal value of the shares nor exceed 3% of the last trading price in the Spanish market for any trades in which Banco Santander does not act on its own behalf.
• The board may establish the purposes for and the procedures through which the authorization may apply.
Treasury shares policy On 27 October 2020, the board approved the current treasury shares policy, which dictates that treasury share transactions may be carried out for these purposes: • Provide liquidity or supply of securities in the market for Banco Santander shares, which gives this market depth and minimizes any temporary imbalances in supply and demand.
• Take advantage for the benefit of all shareholders of weakness in the share price in relation to its medium-term outlook.
• Meet our obligations to deliver shares to our employees and directors.
• Serve any other purpose authorized by the board within the limits set at the general meeting.
Among other things, the policy also provides for: • The principles to uphold in treasury share trades, which include protecting financial markets' integrity and prohibiting market manipulation and insider trading.
• The operating rules on how treasury share trades must be carried out, unless in exceptional circumstances as per the policy. These rules include: • Responsibility for execution of these trades, which falls on the Investments and Holdings department, kept separate from the rest of Santander.
• Venues and types of trades. Trades must generally be carried out in the orders market of the mercado continuo (continuous market) of Spanish stock exchanges.
• Volume limits, which in general must not exceed 15% of the average daily trading volume for Banco Santander shares in the previous 30 sessions in the mercado continuo.
• Price limits. In general, (a) buy orders should not exceed the greater of the price of the last trade in the market between independent parties or the highest price in a buy order in the order book and (b) sell orders should not be lower than the lesser of the price of the last trade in the market by independent parties and the lowest price in a sell order in the order book.
• Time limits, including a 15-day black-out period that applies before each quarterly results presentation.
• Disclosure to the markets of treasury shares trading.
The policy applies to the discretionary trading of treasury shares. It does not apply to transactions in Banco Santander shares carried out to hedge market risks or provide brokerage or hedging for customers.
The full treasury shares policy is at Banco Santander's corporate website.
First Buyback Programme On 28 September 2021, the board resolved to execute a treasury shares buyback programme (First Buyback Programme) worth up to 841 million euros (20% of the Group’s underlying profit in H1 2021) according to the treasury shares policy and 2021 shareholder remuneration policy. It had based its decision on authorization by the ECB, and by shareholders at the April 2020 AGM.
In the First Buyback Programme (from 6 October to 25 November 2021), we acquired 259,930,273 treasury shares —1.499% of Banco Santander’s share capital— at a weighted average price per share of 3.2355 euros.
The purpose of the First Buyback Programme was to reduce Banco Santander’s share capital by cancelling the repurchased shares, which the board put to a vote at the 2022 AGM. See section 3.5 'Our next AGM in 2022'.
Second Buyback Programme Under the same AGM approval, on 24 February 2022 the board resolved that it would execute a new share buyback programme worth 865 million euros (approximately 20% of the Group’s underlying attributable profit in H2 2021) as shareholder remuneration charged against 2021 results once it had obtained the required regulatory authorization (Second Buyback Programme).

Market trends The global economy came back strong. Vaccination programmes enabled a return to economic activity and mobility amid excess liquidity and expansionary fiscal policies. Despite uncertainties due to the surge of new covid-19 variants, positive trends drove a rise in commodity prices and inflationary pressures, which rebounded to the highest levels in a decade in the US and the eurozone.
Central banks in developed economies began a widespread withdrawal of monetary stimulus. The Bank of England raised interest rates to 0.25% on the back of a strong jobs market and high inflation. The US Federal Reserve announced its intention to start raising rates no later than mid-2022. The ECB is limiting the withdrawal of stimulus to liquidity by scaling back its purchase programmes.
Major global equity indices ended 2021 with significant aggregate gains. The banking industry registered better performance owing to the lifting of restrictions on dividend payments, favourable results of US bank stress tests, and better outlooks for most European banks.
The IBEX 35 in Spain increased 7.9%; the DJ Stoxx 50 in Europe by 22.8%; DJ Banks by 34.0%; and the MSCI World Banks by 22.7%.

Our lead independent director, Bruce Carnegie-Brown, is regularly in contact with investors in Europe and North America, particularly in the months prior to the annual general meeting. We gather their insights and form an opinion about their concerns, especially regarding our corporate governance. In 2021 and early 2022, he met with 20 investors, who accounted for approximately 30% of share capital. In our annual board assessment, board members highly value Mr Carnegie-Brown's role in integrating new international best practices in corporate governance, fostering tailored relations with our institutional investors. The nomination committee considers the feedback received from investors.

No restrictions on voting rights or the free transfer of shares in our Bylaws The law and the Bylaws only place restrictions on voting rights as a result of violation of regulations, as indicated below.
There are no non-voting or multiple-voting shares, shares giving preferential treatment in dividend pay-outs, shares limiting the number of votes a single shareholder can cast, or quorum requirements or qualified majorities other than those the law dictates.
There are no restrictions on the free transfer of shares other than those the law dictates, as indicated further in this section.
Neither our Bylaws nor any laws or regulations restrict the transferability of shares. Our Bylaws also do not restrict voting rights (except if they were acquired in violation the law or regulations).
Furthermore, our Bylaws do not include any neutralization provisions as defined in the Ley del Mercado de Valores (Spanish Securities Market Act), which would apply in tender offers or takeover bids.
Please note that the shareholders’ agreement mentioned in section 2.4 'Shareholders' agreements' contains transfer and voting restrictions on shares that are subject to it.
Legal and regulatory restrictions on the acquisition of significant holdings There are legal and regulatory provisions applicable to the Banco Santander because the banking activity is a regulated sector, which involves that the acquisition of significant holdings or influence is subject to regulatory approval or non-objection. As Banco Santander is a listed company, a tender offer or a takeover bid for its shares must be launched to acquire control and for other similar transactions.
The acquisition of significant ownership interests is regulated mainly by: • Regulation (EU) 1024/2013 of the Council of 15 October 2013, conferring specific tasks on the ECB relating to the prudential supervision of credit institutions.
• Spanish Securities Market Act.
• Act 10/2014, of 26 June, on the organization, supervision and solvency of credit institutions (articles 16 to 23) and its implementing regulation, Spanish Royal Decree 84/2015, of 13 February.
The acquisition of a significant stake in Banco Santander may also require approval by (i) other domestic and foreign regulators with supervisory powers over Banco Santander or its subsidiaries' operations, shares listings or other actions concerning such regulators or subsidiaries and (ii) other authorities pursuant to foreign investment regulations (including those imposed due to covid-19) in Spain or other countries where we operate.
Shareholder participation at general meetings All registered holders of shares found on record at least five days prior to the day of general meetings are entitled to attend. Banco Santander allows shareholders to exercise their rights to attend, delegate, vote and participate in general meetings using remote communications systems.
Shareholders can attend general meetings remotely. They can watch it through a live feed, vote, make remarks, propose resolutions and contact the notary public.
The electronic shareholders’ forum is another communications channel available on Banco Santander’s website at the time of the meeting. Shareholders can post items they propose to add to the agenda in the meeting notice, requests for support for their proposals, initiatives to reach the percentage required to exercise minority shareholder rights legally, as well as offers or requests to act as a voluntary proxy.
Supplement to the annual general meeting notice Shareholders representing at least 3% of share capital may request the publication of a supplement to the annual general meeting notice stating the names of shareholders exercising this right, the number of shares they hold, as well as any items to be added to the agenda with an explanation or substantiated proposal for resolutions and any other relevant documentation.
Shareholders representing at least 3% of share capital may also propose reasoned resolutions about any matters that have been, or should be, added to the agenda of a called annual general meeting.
To exercise these rights, shareholders must send a certified notice to Banco Santander’s registered office within five days after the annual general meeting announcement notice is posted.
Any shareholder can also request that the meeting address nonagenda items for which the law does not require a minimum percentage of share capital for a resolution to be put to a vote (the removal of directors or bringing corporate liability action against any of them).
Right to receive information From the time the general meeting notice is posted until the fifth day before the general meeting date on first call, shareholders can submit written requests for information or clarification, or any written questions they deem relevant to the items on the meeting agenda. In addition, within the same period, shareholders can submit written requests for clarification about price-sensitive information Banco Santander has furnished for the CNMV since the last general meeting or about auditor’s reports. Banco Santander posts any information or answers it provides on its corporate website.

Shareholders may also exercise their right to receive information at the meeting. Even if it cannot be asserted in the course of the meeting, or requests are made by shareholders attending remotely, they will be given the appropriate information in writing within seven days after the general meeting.
Quorum and majorities for passing resolutions at general meeting The quorum and majorities set out in our Bylaws and Rules and regulations for general meeting in order to hold a valid meeting and adopt corporate resolutions is according to Spanish law.
On first call, shareholders representing at least 25% of subscribed share capital with voting rights must be in attendance (except for certain matters mentioned subsequently). If a sufficient quorum cannot be constituted, general meetings will be held on second call, which does not require a quorum.
In accordance with our Rules and regulations for general meeting, shareholders voting by mail or electronically before the meeting are counted as present in order to determine the general meeting quorum.
With the exception of certain matters mentioned below, general meeting resolutions pass when shareholders in attendance or by proxy cast more votes in favour than against.
The quorum and majorities required to amend the Bylaws, issue shares and bonds, make structural changes and vote on other significant resolutions permitted by law are set out below. Furthermore, laws applying to credit institutions dictate that, if over 50% of the share capital is present at general meetings, a qualified two-thirds majority is required to raise the proportion of variable remuneration components to fixed components for executive directors and other top executives above 100% (up to 200%); otherwise, a three-quarters majority will be necessary.
Our Bylaws do not require shareholder approval at general meetings for any decisions about acquiring core assets, selling them off or transferring them to another company or similar corporate transactions, unless it is required by law.
Rules for amending our Bylaws The general meeting is the competent body to approve any amendment to the Bylaws. However, only the board can decide to change the registered office within Spain.
The board or, where appropriate, the shareholders who have drafted a proposed amendment to the Bylaws must write it out completely, in addition to a report justifying it; and provide them to shareholders at the time the meeting to debate proposed amendment is announced.
The general meeting notice must clearly state the items to be amended as well as the rights of all shareholders to examine the full text of a proposed amendment and the related report at Banco Santander’s registered office, and order these documents delivered or sent to them free of charge.
If shareholders are convened to debate amendments to the Bylaws, the quorum on first call will be constituted if 50% of subscribed share capital with voting rights is present. If a sufficient quorum cannot be constituted, the general meeting will be held on second call, where 25% of subscribed share capital with voting rights must be present.
When less than 50% of subscribed share capital with voting rights are present, resolutions on amendments to the Bylaws can only be validly adopted if two-thirds of shareholders attending the meeting in person or by proxy vote for them. However, when 50% or more of subscribed share capital with voting rights is present, resolutions may validly pass with an absolute majority.
Resolutions to amend the Bylaws that involve new obligations for shareholders must be accepted by those affected.
The Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) must authorise us to amend our Bylaws. However, amendments that are exempt from authorization but must still be reported to the SSM include any to change the registered office within Spain, raise share capital, add imperative or prohibitive laws or regulations to the wording of the Bylaws, or change the wording in order to comply with court or administrative rulings and any others the SSM has declared exempt due to a lack of materiality in response to prior consultations.
3.3 Dividends and shareholder remuneration. 
Distribution charged against 2021 results ECB Recommendation of 15 December 2020, which asked banks not to pay out dividends charged against 2021 results (ECB Recommendation III), was in force for over half of 2021.
On 23 July 2021, the ECB believed the reasons underpinning ECB Recommendation III to limit dividend payouts were no longer valid and, thus, repealed it effectively on 30 September 2021.
On 28 September 2021, the board announced its 2021 shareholder remuneration policy to pay out an interim distribution from approximately 40% of the Group's underlying profit (half through a cash dividend and half through a shares buyback).
• Interim remuneration. Accordingly, it authorized the payment of an interim dividend of 4.85 euro cents per share (i.e. 20% of the Group's underlying profit in H1'21), in cash and charged against 2021 profits; it was paid on 2 November 2021. The board also voted to launch the First Buyback Programme worth 841 million euros (20% of the Group's underlying profit in H1'21) once the ECB approved it on 28 September 2021 (see in 'First Buyback Programme' in section 2.5).
• Final remuneration. On 24 February 2022, within the 2021 shareholder remuneration policy, the board of directors voted to: • submit a resolution at the 2022 AGM to approve a final cash dividend in the gross amount of 5.15 eurocents per share, worth approximately 865 million euros (approximately 20% of the Group’s underlying profit in H2 2021). If approved at the AGM, the dividend would be payable from 2 May 2022. The estimate of 865 million euros is based on the assumption that, once the Second Buyback Programme has taken place, the number of outstanding shares entitled to receiving dividends will be 16,804,353,202. Therefore, the total dividend may be higher if fewer shares than anticipated are acquired in the Second Buyback Programme; otherwise, it will be lower.
• implement a Second Buyback Programme worth 865 million euros (approximately 20% of the Group’s underlying profit in H2 2021), once the necessary regulatory authorization has been obtained. For more details on the programme, see section 2.5 'Treasury shares'.
Annual report 2021 196


 

 

 
Responsible Corporate Economic and Risk management Contents banking governance financial review and compliance. 
If shareholders approve the dividend payout resolution and the ECB authorizes the Second Buyback Programme, it will result in a payout of approximately 40% of the Group’s underlying attributable profit for 2021. If the buyback reaches the maximum within the programme period, remuneration will be split equally between cash dividends and shares buybacks. This final remuneration will enable Santander to meet the target set in the shareholder remuneration policy disclosed to the market on 28 September 2021.
Shareholder remuneration policy for 2022 results For the 2022 results the shareholder remuneration policy that the board intends to apply is a total remuneration of approximately of c.40% of the group's underlying profit, split in approximately equal parts between cash dividends and share buybacks, thus continuing the policy applied with respect to 2021 results.
The implementation of the shareholder remuneration policy is subject to future corporate and regulatory decisions and approvals.

Responsible Corporate Economic and Risk management Contents banking governance financial review and compliance 4.2 Board composition. 
Size At 31 December 2021, the board of directors was made up of the 15 members whose profile and background are described in section 4.1 'Our directors'. The Bylaws allow it to have between 12 and 17 members.
Composition by type of director The composition of the board of directors is balanced between executive and non-executive directors, most of whom are independent. Each director’s status has been verified by the nomination committee and submitted to the board.
Executive directors • Ana Botín, Group Executive Chair • José Antonio Álvarez, Group Vice-Chair and Chief Executive Officer. 
Section 4.3 provides a more detailed description of their roles and duties under 'Group executive chair and chief executive officer'.
Independent directors • Bruce Carnegie-Brown (lead independent director) • Homaira Akbari • Álvaro Cardoso • R. Martín Chávez • Sol Daurella • Henrique de Castro • Gina Díez • Ramiro Mato • Belén Romana • Pamela Walkden. 
Every year, the nomination committee verifies the independence of the board members in this category and informs the board of its findings. It takes all pertinent circumstances into account, particularly possible significant business relations that could affect their independence. This analysis is described further in section 4.6 'Nomination committee activities in 2021' and in subsection C.1.3 in section 9.2 'Statistical information on corporate governance required by the CNMV'.
Independent non-executive directors account for 66.7% of board members. This conforms to best corporate governance practices as well as the board’s Rules and regulations, which require that the board be predominantly made up of non-executive directors with at least 50% independent directors.
At the end of 2021, the average term of independent non-executive directors was 4.05 years.
TERM OF INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS 3.0 3.4 3.01 3.56 3.42 3.02 4.05 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021. 
Other external directors • Javier Botín • Luis Isasi • Sergio Rial. 
These directors cannot be classified as independent directors for the following reasons: • Mr Botín has been director for over 12 years.
• Mr Isasi as, although the nomination committee and the board believe that he meets the requirements to be classed as an independent director - in view of his remuneration as nonexecutive chair of Santander España, his entitlements as a director and the special nature of this body as supervisor of a business unit without its own corporate identity separate to Banco Santander, under prudent criteria it is considered preferable to classify him as an external director.
• Mr Rial, as a former executive director of Banco Santander as CEO of Banco Santander (Brasil) S.A. and Regional head of South America until 31 December 2021.

Executive directors have five years from the time they were appointed to reach the required level of investment.

Diversity A diverse board of directors is essential to its effectiveness.

Thus, we seek to achieve a sound balance of technical skills, expertise • Country of origin or international education: selection considers and points of view. cultural diversity and international education and experience, especially in the Group's main geographies.

The board’s number of women members is above the average for large listed companies in Spain and Europe. According to figures published by the CNMV in May 2021, based on the annual corporate governance reports for 2020, the percentage of female directors in IBEX 35 companies in Spain was on average 31.26%. Furthermore, according to the last Gender Diversity Index Report published by European Women on Boards (an association which cooperates with the European Commission) in October 2021 the percentage of female directors in large listed companies was, on average, 35%.
• Age: the selection policy on the selection, suitability assessment and succession of directors also considers that selection processes must promote age diversity. There are no age limits for becoming a director or holding any role on the board, including the chair and the chief executive officer.
• Education and career: selection ensures that candidates are qualified and suitable to understand our Group’s businesses, structure and geographies individually and collectively; and that they fit within the Santander culture. The appointment process ensures that candidates will have skills and expertise in such areas deemed important for the Group. It takes into account education and work experience. In addition to professional experience, it considers their academic education.
• Our policy has no implicit bias that could lead to discrimination due to race, disability and/or ethnicity.
Board skills and diversity matrix The board’s skills matrix reflects the balance of the knowledge, skills, qualifications, diversity and experience required to design and pursue our long-term strategy in an ever-changing market.
We updated it in 2018 to make it simpler, more transparent and comprehensive. It contains more information for our investors and other stakeholders, who demand that certain skills be more visible on our board. We also took into account recommendations from the EBA and ESMA guidelines on the suitability assessment of board members and key functions holders, and also ECB Guide to fit and proper assessments. It has been further updated in October 2020 to disclose information on board's diversity in terms of age, on the back of the CNMV's approval of the revised version of the Spanish Corporate Governance Code.
This year's matrix (below) follows the structure introduced last year: • We distinguish thematic and horizontal skills.
• We include a separate diversity section that details diversity in terms of gender, country of origin and/or education abroad, and age. Finally, we also show board tenure.
In line with last year, the skills matrix discloses each board member's skills and competence as a sign of our commitment to transparency. Section 4.1 'Our directors' includes a paragraph on each director's skills and competence to more clearly substantiate the matrix.
We also include an additional chart (entitled 'Committees skills and diversity matrix') that shows the balanced diversity of skills on the board as a whole and on each board committee. That enables the board committees' overall effectiveness to be evaluated as it refers to the significant presence of the skills relevant to each committee's scope.
This year's matrix (below) shows that there are no substantial gaps with regard to the qualitative composition of the board and its committees, although we remain focused on ensuring a robust board skills diversity. In particular, the ongoing need for coverage of strategic markets for Banco Santander as well as for technology, digital strategy, banking, finance and regulatory and ethics experience and expertise remains important, as evidenced by our most recent board appointments. The appropriateness of board skills and diversity will continue to be monitored on an ongoing basis.

Election, renewal and succession of directors. 
Election of directors Our directors are appointed for three-year terms. However, one-third of board members are renewed each year in order of their tenure, based on when they were appointed. Outgoing directors may be reelected. Each appointment, re-election and ratification is submitted to a separate vote at the general meeting.
Procedures for appointing, re-electing, evaluating and removing directors Our internal policy for the selection, suitability assessment and succession of directors dictates standards for the board’s quantitative and qualitative composition, how it is revised and how new candidates are identified, selected and appointed.
Shareholders appoint and re-elect directors at the general meeting. If directors step down during the term of office, the board of directors may provisionally designate another director by co-option until the general meeting confirms or revokes the appointment at the earliest subsequent meeting.
The nomination committee must issue a report and a reasoned opinion in advance of any proposal the board will make to shareholders to appoint, re-elect and ratify any category of director, as well as in advance of any board resolution about co-option.
Proposals must include a duly substantiated report prepared by the board containing an assessment of the qualifications, experience and merits of the proposed candidate. Re-election and ratification proposals will provide an assessment of the work and dedication to the position during the last period in which the proposed director held office. If the board disregards the nomination committee's opinion, it must explain its decision and record its reasons in meeting minutes.
Directors must meet specific requirements dictated by laws for credit institutions and our Bylaws. Upon taking office, they must formally undertake to fulfil the obligations and duties prescribed therein and in the Rules and regulations of the board.
Our directors must be of renowned business and professional integrity, and have the knowledge and experience needed to perform their role and exercise good governance. Director candidates will also be selected on the basis of their professional contribution to the entire board.
For more details, see section 4.1 'Our directors' and the 'Board skills and diversity matrix' in section 4.2.
The board of directors will endeavour to have significantly more external or non-executive directors than executive directors, and for the number of independent directors to make up at least half of all members.
Our directors shall cease to hold office when the term for which they were appointed ends (unless they are re-elected); when the general meeting so resolves; or when they resign. When a director ceases to hold office prior to the end of his or her term (i.e. by general meeting resolution or by resignation), the director shall sufficiently explain the reasons for the resignation or, in the event of non-executive directors, their opinion on the reasons for their cessation in office by the general meeting in a letter to the other board members. In addition, when appropriate, Banco Santander will publicly disclose the cessation in office, including sufficient information on the director's reasons or circumstances provided by the director.
Directors must tender their resignation to the board and formally step down from their position if the board, on recommendation of the nomination committee, deems it appropriate in cases that may adversely affect the board's functioning or Banco Santander’s credibility or reputation. In particular, they must resign if they find themselves in a circumstance of ineligibility or prohibition provided by law, irrespective of Royal Decree 84/2015, which implements Act 10/2014 on the organization, supervision and solvency of credit institutions, and on the honourability requirements for directors and the consequences of directors who subsequently fail to meet them.
Directors must notify the board, as soon as possible, of any circumstances affecting them (whether or not they are related to their performance in Banco Santander) that might damage Santander's credibility or reputation, especially when under criminal investigation; and of the developments of any criminal proceedings. When the board is informed, or becomes aware in another way, of any such situations, it will examine them as soon as possible and, based on the particulars, will decide, following a report from the nomination committee, any measures to adopt, such as opening an internal investigation, calling on directors to resign or proposing their dismissal.
Proprietary non-executive directors must also tender their resignation when the shareholder they represent sells off or significantly reduces its equity holding.
Succession planning Succession planning is a key element of our good governance as it ensures orderly role transitions, as well as board continuity and stability and its adequate refreshment and independence. It is a yearly cycle with a well-defined methodology and timelines, and a clear allocation of responsibilities. Our aim is to boost diverse talent pipelines across functions.
Santander’s policy on director selection, suitability assessment and succession focuses on: • Quantitative and qualitative board and committee composition criteria that are set by the Bylaws, the Rules and regulations of the board of directors and the board itself and include suitability and diversity standards and targets.
• A periodic review of the quantitative and qualitative composition of the board of directors and its committees that includes an overall suitability assessment of the board.
• Identification of potential candidates to join the board of directors.
• A robust board member selection, suitability and nomination process.
This policy has specific core performance indicators, reviewed each year, for such aspects as succession effectiveness (replacements fulfilled by identified candidates); the number of internal and external candidates immediately available to succeed executive directors; training and development plans for potential candidates to succeed executive directors in one to three years; gender diversity and country of origin or international education; updated board member tenure; the strength of the list of successors to executive directors, committee chairs and the lead independent director; and.

Responsible Corporate Economic and Risk management Contents banking governance financial review and compliance the percentage of candidates to succeed directors who are immediately available (or candidates for a one-to-three year period).
The nomination committee and the board prioritize member succession planning, with sound and appropriate plans in place that are regularly revisited. Given the importance that the Group places in succession planning, in 2020 an external opinion was sought in relation to our succession policy and associated succession processes concluding that our succession arrangements and framework meet regulatory requirements and align with industry best practice.
4.3 Board functioning and effectiveness. 
The board is the highest decision-making body and focuses on supervision Banco Santander’s board of directors is our highest decision-making body, except in matters reserved to shareholders at the general meeting. It performs its duties with unity of purpose and independent judgement.
The board’s policy is to designate executive bodies and managers to run Group’s day-to-day operations and apply its strategy. It focuses on general supervision and other functions it cannot delegate by law, under the Bylaws and the Rules and regulations of the board, including: • General policies and strategies (including capital and liquidity, new products, operations and services; culture and values including policies on responsible business and sustainability, in particular, on environmental and social matters; risk control; remuneration policy; and compliance).
• Financial and non-financial reporting, and information reported to shareholders, investors and the general public, as well as the processes and controls that ensure full disclosure.
• Policies on reporting and communication with shareholders, markets and public opinion, and supervision of the disclosure of information and communications about Group.
• Internal audit plan.
• Selection, succession and remuneration of directors, senior management and other key positions.
• Effectiveness of the group’s corporate and internal governance system.
• Significant corporate transactions and investments.
• Calling the general shareholders’ meeting.
• Governance-related matters in general (including the approval of non-delegable related-party transactions, which are not subject to the general meeting's authority).
• Banco Santander and Group’s corporate and internal governance, including the GSGM, corporate frameworks and internal regulations.
Structure of the board The board’s governance structure ensures that it discharges its duties effectively. This section provides further details about this structure, which can be split into four dimensions: • Group executive chair and chief executive officer, who are the most senior executives in the Group’s strategic and ordinary management, which the board is responsible for overseeing, ensuring that their roles are clearly separated and complementary. The respective roles and responsibilities have been updated as at the date of this report. Further details are shown below.
• A lead independent director who is responsible for coordinating non-executive directors effectively and making sure they serve as an appropriate counter- balance to executive directors.
• A board committee structure, which supports the board in: • Managing Group by exercising decision-making powers in the executive committee.
• Formulating strategy for core areas in the responsible banking, sustainability and culture committee, and in the innovation and technology committee.
• In supervision and taking important decisions the audit, nomination, remuneration and risk supervision, regulation and compliance committees.
• A board secretary, who supports the board, its committees and our chair, and is also general secretary of the Group.
Rules and regulations of the board The board is governed by the rules set out in the Bylaws and the Rules and regulations of the board, both of which are available at our corporate website.
• Bylaws. Dictate the basic rules that apply to the composition and operation of the board and its members' duties and are supplemented and implemented by the Rules and regulations of the board. They can be amended only by the general meeting. See 'Rules for amending our Bylaws' in section 3.2.
• Rules and regulations of the board. Set the rules for running and internally organizing the board of directors and its committees through the development of applicable laws and Bylaws' provisions. They set out the principles governing the actions of the board and its committees and the duties of its members.
In 2021 the board amended its Rules and regulations on two occasions:
On 27 April, to allow the possibility to appoint more than one vicesecretary of the board to assist with the duties of the secretary of the board and, where appropriate, to replace him in the event of absence, inability to act or illness. This possibility was subject to the Bylaws so providing, so their amendment will be proposed for approval at the next 2022 AGM. See section 3.5 'Our next AGM in 2022'.
On 27 July, to adapt them to, and ensure their consistency with Act 5/2021 and to make technical improvements and other minor changes. The main amendments adapting to Act 5/2021 were to: • In relation to the approval and oversight of related-party transactions: • Introduce the delegation of the board's power to approve related-party transactions and an internal reporting and regular control procedure for any transactions that it has delegated its power to approve.
Annual report 2021 215


 

 

 

 

 

 
Responsible Corporate Economic and Risk management Contents banking governance financial review and compliance • Lay out the audit committee’s report about related-party transactions that will be subject to approval at the general meeting or by the board, as well as its duties in overseeing the procedure for reporting on, and regularly controlling, any transactions the board has delegated.
• Align the internal rules for related-party transactions to the new legal provisions.
• In relation to the directors' remuneration scheme: • Adapt the rules on approval, entry into force and maximum duration of the directors’ remuneration policy to the new legal provisions.
• Amend the minimum content of the remuneration policy to the Spanish Companies Act.
• Clarify that, if the annual remunerations report is rejected at the general meeting, the policy in force can only apply until the next annual general meeting.
Lastly, on 24 February 2022 the board changed its Rules and regulations to introduce fundamentally technical amendments and: • Acknowledge that the board may establish that executives other than the chair report directly to the board or its committees. In this connection, on 24 February 2022 the board established that the chief executive officer will report exclusively to the board in line with governance best practice as further described below.
• Bolster coordination mechanisms between the audit and the responsible banking, sustainability and culture committees.
• Coordinate the wording of the Rules and regulations with the wording of the Bylaws provisions which amendment is proposed to the 2022 AGM.
The Rules and regulations of the board adhere to all legal requirements as well as the principles set out in the Spanish Corporate Governance Code, revised in June 2020; Corporate Governance Principles for Banks of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision of July 2015; and the guidelines established by the EBA in Guidelines on internal governance that came into force on 31 December 2021.
Our rules on the audit committee also adhere to the recommendations and good operating practices established in Technical Guide 3/2017 of the CNMV, on Audit Committees of Public Interest Entities. It also complies with the US regulations because our shares are listed as ADS on the NYSE, in particular, with Rule 10A-3 under the Securities Exchange Act (SEA) on standards relating to audit committees pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley act of 2002 (SOX).
Our rules on the nomination and the remuneration committees also adhere to the recommendations and good operating practices set out in the CNMV’s Technical Guide 1/2019 on Nomination and Remuneration Committees.
Group executive chair and chief executive officer Our executive chair is Ana Botín and our chief executive officer is José Antonio Álvarez. Their respective roles and responsibilities were updated as at the date of this report in order to accelerate the execution of the Group´s strategy and operations and to align with governance best practices.
The roles of our Group executive chair and chief executive officer are clearly separated, and can be summarized as follows:
ROLES OF THE EXECUTIVE CHAIR AND THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER Executive chair Chief executive officer • The chair is the highest-ranking executive in Grupo Santander and its main representative with regulators, authorities and other major stakeholders.
• The chair is responsible for the long-term strategy of the Group, including new tech digital growth engines, namely PagoNxt and the Digital Consumer Bank.

• Risk, Compliance and Internal Audit functions have free and unfettered access to the board and its committees in order to preserve their full independence, without prejudice to the regular reporting lines to the chair and chief executive officer of the CAE and CRO.
• The chair also leads the appointment and succession planning of the senior management of Santander Group, to be submitted for approval to the nomination committee and board.
• The chief executive officer is entrusted with the day-to-day management of the business with the highest executive functions and exclusively reports to the board in this regard.
• Accordingly, the chief executive officer’s direct reports are the senior managers in charge of the business units such as the regional heads (Europe, North America and South America) and those in charge of the global businesses (Wealth Management & Insurance, Corporate & Investment Banking, Cards & Digital Solutions), encompassing the relevant support & control functions.

• Additionally, the chief executive officer is responsible for Regulatory & Supervisory Relations and for embedding the sustainability policy of the Group in the day-to-day management of Group businesses and the support & control functions.
The duties of the group executive chair, the chief executive officer, and balances properly balance Grupo Santander’s corporate the board, and its committees are clearly separated. Various checks governance structure. In particular:
Annual report 2021 216


 

 

 
Responsible Corporate Economic and Risk management Contents banking governance financial review and compliance • The board and its committees supervise both the group executive chair and the chief executive officer.
• The board of directors has delegated all its powers to the executive chair and the chief executive officer, except for those that cannot be delegated by law and under the Bylaws and the Rules and regulations of the board. The board directly exercises those powers to perform its general supervisory function.
• The lead independent director leads the group executive chair’s succession and appointment.
Lead independent director • The audit committee is chaired by an independent director who is considered a ‘financial expert’ as defined in Regulation S-K of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
• The group executive chair may not simultaneously act as Banco Santander’s chief executive officer.
• The corporate risk, compliance and internal audit functions report as independent units to a committee or a member of the board of directors, and have direct, unfettered access to the board.
The role of the lead independent director is key to our governance and makes sure that non-executive directors serve as an appropriate counterbalance to the executive directors.
The following chart illustrates the functions and their application of the lead independent director in 2021:
DUTIES OF THE LEAD INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR AND ACTIVITIES DURING 2021. 
Duties Activities in 2021. 
Facilitate discussion and open dialogue among independent directors, including coordinating private meetings of non-executive directors without the executive present; and proactively engage with them to consider their views and opinions.
Held eight meetings with non-executive directors without executive directors present, where they were able to voice views and opinions. The meetings were also a valuable opportunity to discuss other matters such as, among others, board training topics, executive director and key management performance; reflections on areas for continuous improvement with regard to the operation of the board and its committees; and progress with externally facilitated Governance and Effectiveness reviews.
Direct the periodic evaluation of the chair of the board of directors and coordinate her succession plan. Led the annual evaluation of the chair in order to determine her variable pay. Furthermore, played a key coordination role with regard to ongoing succession planning activity, as additionally facilitated through his chairmanship of the nomination committee.
See section 3.1 'Shareholder communication and engagement' for full details of the lead independent director’s activities. Engagement with shareholders and other investors with the purpose of gathering information on their concerns, in particular, with regard to Banco Santander´s corporate governance.
Replace the chair in the event of absence with key rights such as the ability to call board meetings under the terms set down in the Rules and regulations of the board.
Although lead independent director did not have to replace the chair of the board in any board meetings he remained fully committed with its proper functioning.
Request that a meeting of the board of directors be called or that new items be added to the agenda for a meeting of the board. While the lead independent director did not need to request additional board meetings to be called, he remained fully engaged and informed on board meeting agendas and encouraged constructive challenge on the same.
The board currently has seven committees and one international advisory board with the following characteristics:
Mandatory committees Voluntary committees (required by Law, under Bylaws or under the Rules and regulations of the board)
Supervision, information advice and recommendations Decision-making regarding functions in risk, financial reporting and audit, Support and proposal powers nomination and remuneration matters in strategic areas.

Responsible Corporate Economic and Risk management Contents banking governance financial review and compliance. 
Secretary of the board Jaime Pérez Renovales is the secretary of the board. He assists the chair and ensures the formal and substantial legality of all the board’s actions. He also makes sure good governance recommendations and procedures are observed and regularly reviewed.
The board’s secretary is also general secretary of Banco Santander. He acts as the secretary of all board committees and thus facilitates a fluid and effective relationship between the committees and the different units of the Group that must collaborate with them. It is not necessary to be a director to be secretary.
The nomination committee must issue an opinion before submitting proposals to appoint or remove the secretary to the board.
The board has three vice-secretaries. They assist the secretary with his duties on the board and its committees, and replace him in the event of absence, inability to act or illness. In April 2021, the board of directors appointed F. Javier Illescas Fernández-Bermejo (head of Group Corporate Legal), Julia Bayón Pedraza (head of Group Business Legal) and Adolfo Díaz-Ambrona Moreno (general secretary of Santander España) as vice-secretaries, replacing Óscar García Maceiras (who left the Group in March).
Board meetings The board of directors held 15 meetings in 2021, including 13 ordinary meetings and 2 extraordinary meetings. The Rules and regulations of the board dictate that it must hold at least nine annual ordinary meetings and one quarterly meeting.
Although board meetings follow an annually set calendar and a provisional agenda of items to discuss, new items can be added to the agenda and additional meetings can be called in accordance with new business needs. Directors may also propose items to be added to the agenda and are duly informed of changes to the calendar and meeting agendas.
The board also keeps a formal list of matters only it can address. It prepares a plan to distribute them among the ordinary meetings scheduled in the provisional calendar it has approved.
Directors are given relevant documents sufficiently in advance of each meeting of the board. This information sent to them via secure electronic means is specifically for preparing meetings and, in the board’s opinion, it is thorough and sent sufficiently in advance.
The Rules and regulations of the board of directors also expressly recognise directors’ right to request and obtain information on anything related to Banco Santander and its domestic and foreign subsidiaries. They also recognise their right to inspect the books, files, documents and any other records of corporate transactions, in addition to premises and facilities. Furthermore, directors can request and obtain any information and advice they deem necessary from the secretary in order to perform their duties.
The board meets at the chair’s discretion or at the request of at least three directors.
The lead independent director is also authorised to request a board meeting or that new items be added to the agenda for a meeting that has already been called.
Directors must attend meetings in person and make sure to limit absences to cases of absolute necessity. The nomination committee checks that no less than 75% of directors attend board and committee meetings. For further information, see 'Board and committee attendance' in this section 4.3.
If directors are unable to be present at meeting, they can designate another director as their special proxy for each meeting in writing to act on their behalf. Proxies are granted with instructions. Nonexecutive directors may only be represented by other non-executive directors. One director can hold more than one proxy.
The board may meet in various rooms at the same time, provided that interactivity and communication among them in real time can be secured by audio-visual means or by telephone to hold the meeting concurrently.
Board meetings are validly quorate when more than half of its members attend in person or by proxy.
Resolutions are adopted by absolute majority of directors in attendance. The chair has the casting vote in the event of a tie. The Bylaws and the Rules and regulations of the board only require qualified majorities according to the law.
The board secretary keeps the board’s documents on file. He records the content of meetings in meeting minutes. Meeting minutes of the board and committees include statements members expressly request to be put on record.
The board may hire legal, accounting or financial advisers and other experts at Banco Santander’s expense for assistance with their duties.
The board should encourage communication between its committees, especially the risk supervision, regulation and compliance committee and the audit committee. It should also promote dialogue between the risk supervision, regulation and compliance committee and the remuneration committee and the responsible banking, sustainability and culture committee, given the relevance of their respective work with each other.
Some committees hold joint meetings throughout the year. Although they cannot vote, any director can attend and participate in meetings of committees on which they do not serve if invited by the chair of the board and the chair of the respective committee, after having asked the chair of the board. Furthermore, all board members who are not executive committee members may attend executive committee meetings at least twice a year, for which they are to be called by the chair.

Committee meetings Board committees follow a meetings calendar that includes at least four meetings (except for the innovation and technology committee, which holds at least three meetings) and an annual work plan established yearly. Each committee meets as often as is required to fulfil its duties.
Board and committee attendance. 
Committee meetings will be quorate if more than half of committee members are present in person or by proxy. Committee resolutions pass with a simple majority of votes. In the event of a tie, the committee chair has the casting vote. Committee members may grant a proxy to another member; however, non-executive directors can only be represented by other non-executive directors.
Committee members are given relevant documents sufficiently in advance of each meeting to ensure effectiveness.
Committees have the authority to summon executives, who will appear at meetings at the invitation and under the terms dictated by the chair. Furthermore, committees may also submit a request to the general secretary to hire legal, accounting or financial advisers or other experts to assist with their duties at Banco Santander’s expense.
The role of committee secretary is non-voting and falls on the general secretary and secretary of the board. This fosters a fluid and efficient relationship with the units that must work with, and report to, committees.
Committee chairs report on committees’ meetings and activities at all board meetings. Furthermore, all board members are given a copy of committees’ meeting minutes and all documents provided for meetings.

A. Includes hours of meeting preparation and attendance. B. Of the 13 ordinary meetings held.
On average, each director dedicated approximately 58 days per year to their role (including their participation in committees), and 5 days to each board meeting, working 8 hours daily.
Directors must report any professional activity or post for which they will be nominated to the nomination committee so it can assess the time commitment to the group and check for possible conflicts of interest.
The annual suitability reassessment our nomination committee conducts every year (see in section 4.6 'Nomination committee activities in 2021') allows us to keep all information on the estimated time dedicated by directors to other roles and/or professional activities up to date and confirm their capacity to exercise good governance as directors of Banco Santander. Therefore, any necessary travel time taken to attend in-person board meetings is considered for reference purposes.
Overall, Banco Santander is able to verify compliance with the maximum number of company boards on which the law allows our directors to serve at once (i.e., up to one executive and two nonexecutive roles, or four non-executive roles; roles in the same group are considered a single role and roles in not-for-profit or noncommercial organizations are not included).
Director training and induction programmes The board promotes its directors’ continued training through an annual board training programme. Its contents are chosen by the board based on its performance reviews as well as technological, risk management and regulatory issues.
In 2021, programme workshops (held, as usual, after board meetings) addressed these topics: • Regulatory compliance regarding conflicts of interest, market abuse, competitors and other types of risk.
• Risk Appetite Statement annual review covering material risks, calibration of limits and implementation across the Group and future enhancements proposed for 2022.
• Credit risk management regarding provisions calculations (e.g. covid-19 overlay, scenarios and impacts, and management of vulnerable industries).
• The transition from the IBOR to alternative benchmark rates as well as identification of key risks (especially legal, business, financial and accounting risks).
• Regulatory requirements regarding financial crime and best practice guidance (including anti money laundering and sanctions).
• The building and measurement of risk regulatory models.
• New special situations and resolution framework and governance bodies’ roles and responsibilities in special situations.
• Cloud migration, system changes and expectations for 2022.
In addition, the board has sound induction and development programmes so new directors can better understand Santander’s business and governance rules. They normally run for six to twelve months from the time the board appoints a new director. They involve key group managers who provide detailed information on their areas of responsibility, and address the special needs found in a director’s suitability assessment.
In 2021, these directors completed induction programmes with additional areas of focus: • R Martín Chávez, who attended specific deep-dive workshops on the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) and on Spain’s regulatory framework because he had developed his career in the US. Mr Chávez’s induction plan ended in January 2021.
• Gina Díez, who attended additional deep-dive workshops on and on the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) and regulatory framework because she had developed her career in Mexico. Also, she received additional training in auditing, accounting and financial risk management. Ms Díez’s induction plan ended in July 2021.
Those programmes were tailored to their experience and particular induction needs found in their suitability assessments. 
Board assessment in 2021 The board undergoes a yearly assessment of its performance and effectiveness, composition, quality of its work and individual performance of its members. The assessment includes its committees and is conducted at least every three years by an external independent consultant, whose independence is assessed by the nomination committee. In 2020, the assessment was conducted by an external independent expert and complemented by a wider external review of our governance arrangements in 2021, with the aim of assessing its overall functioning and adherence to regulations, supervisors’ expectations, and industry best practice. In addition to the above-mentioned structured reviews, we conducted an internally facilitated review of the effectiveness of our board practices. For more details, see 'Board assessment and actions to continuously improve its functioning' in section 1.2.

Functions The executive committee is a key governance body in Banco Santander and the Group. The board delegated to it all its powers except those that cannot be delegated by the law or under the Bylaws and Rules and regulations of the board. The executive committee generally meets once a week to ensure key decisionmaking in a timely and efficient manner, so the board can focus on general supervision. It regularly reports to the board on its core matters, providing all directors with the minutes and documents from its meetings.
Committee performance The board, supported by its nomination committee, sets the executive committee's size and qualitative composition, focused on overall effectiveness while keeping with the board composition guidelines. Although the executive committee does not exactly mirror the qualitative composition of the board of directors, it is consistent with an external director majority, including three independent directors. This composition ensures a balance of opinions as well as internal and external perspectives. It also complies with Recommendation 37 of the Spanish Corporate Governance Code, which recommends to have at least two nonexecutive directors, including one independent director. The secretary of the board is also the secretary of the executive committee.
The executive committee can meet as many times as its chair convenes it, however, it generally meets once a week.
Main activities in 2021 In 2021, the executive committee addressed a breadth of matters relating to the business of the Group and its main subsidiaries, risk management, corporate transactions and main proposals subsequently submitted to the board of directors.
The key topics covered in the year were: • Results: The committee was kept up to date on the Group´s results and their impact on investors and analysts.
• Business performance: The committee was kept continuously and fully informed of the performance of the Group’s business areas, through management reporting or reports on specific matters.
• Information reported by the chair: The board´s chair, who also chairs the executive committee, regularly reported on key matters relating to the Group´s management, strategy and institutional issues.
• Information reported by the CEO: The CEO reported on key matters relating to the Group´s performance, budget and strategic business plans execution.
• Corporate transactions: The committee analysed and (where appropriate) approved some corporate transactions (e.g. investments and divestments, joint ventures and capital transactions).
• Covid-19: The committee was kept informed of the pandemic and was active in decision-making to mitigate its impact on the Group and the global economy, to preserve the health of employees and customers and to provide healthcare and financial resources to public and private institutions fighting the pandemic.
• Risks: The committee was regularly informed about the risks facing the Group. Within the framework of the risk governance model, it made decisions about transactions that it had to approve due to their materiality. It was also kept informed on specific risk matters such as the Group’s leveraged finance, distribution risk and credit evolution in certain industries.
• Subsidiaries: The committee received reports on the performance of the various units and business lines. In particular, it was kept duly informed about Santander España´s headcount and distribution model restructuring, specific regional projects (such as the One Europe App), strategic initiatives the board had approved during the year affecting subsidiaries and the appointments of key positions there.
• Capital and liquidity: The committee reviewed regulatory plans and exercises (e.g. EBA stress test) and received regular reports on capital ratios and the measures taken to optimize them; pricing (originations) and portfolio profitability.
• Supervisors and regulatory matters: The committee was regularly informed of regulatory developments, the supervisory agenda for the year and projects to ensure compliance with supervisory recommendations and regulatory changes.
• Governance models: The committee discussed the new governance and strategy models for new units (such as the Investment Platforms) before they were submitted to the board for approval.
• Issuances: By virtue of the board's delegation, the committee issued non-convertible debentures.
In 2021, the executive committee held 40 meetings. 'Board and committee attendance' in section 4.3 provides information on members’ meeting attendance and the estimated average time each one spent on preparing for and participating in meetings.
2022 priorities • Ensuring at all times the committee’s effectiveness with consideration for all areas for continuous improvement and an overall review of its operations.
• Continuing to ensure proper coordination with the board and its committees (including other executive committees.) • Monitoring the performance of strategic initiatives that affect the Group’s many global businesses and subsidiaries.

Responsible Corporate Economic and Risk management Contents banking governance financial review and compliance 4.5 Audit committee activities in 2021 'Our fundamental responsibility is the effective oversight of the financial information process and internal controls, ensuring the effectiveness of our internal audit function and maintaining a professional and open relationship with the external auditors. We must remain flexible and adapt priorities to the new challenges that may not have been foreseen at the beginning of the year. 2021 proved no different as we faced the second year of managing through a global pandemic, supporting our customers and staff, while maintaining the appropriate controls.
The committee benefited from a good mix of experience and skills of our members. Each provided appropriate advice and challenge to the management. We also took views from all three key lines of defence (management, risk and audit) to oversee the progress in key global initiatives. Communication with executives and non-executives globally became even more important, given the travel restrictions around the world, as it allowed us to share with them our concerns and thoughts with them.
In the coming year, we will progress some exciting and large strategic projects in which we will try to strike the delicate balance of supporting management and ensuring an appropriate level of control for a Group of our size'.

Responsible Corporate Economic and Risk management Contents banking governance financial review and compliance 4.6 Nomination committee activities in 2021 'The committee continued its work on overseeing the process on key appointments to the board and senior management roles, supported by its work on robust succession planning. Focus remained on the collective skills and experience of the board and ensuring that gender and broader diversity remain front of mind in our succession planning.
Given our commitment to continuous improvement and to fully adhering to the best industry standards, evolving supervisory expectations and to stakeholders' best interests (clients, employees, shareholders and, more generally, the community in which Banco Santander operates), we continued our work on improving our overall effectiveness through commissioning an external evaluation to holistically review our governance model.
An appropriate mix of members’ skills, further reinforced by the appointment of Gina Díez as a member, helped the committee to address these tasks and to operate effectively, offering appropriate challenge and support to management'.

In particular, the committee conducted a comprehensive review of the Group’s long term variable compensation which has been in place for five years, to see what enhancements could be implemented, and proposed simplifying the metrics, amending the key metrics to align with the Group’s evolving strategy and introducing an ESG metric for the first time.

Responsible Corporate Economic and Risk management Contents banking governance financial review and compliance. 
Annual assessment of the committee and its achievement of 2021 objectives In 2021, to follow up on the external review in 2020, an internal effectiveness review of our board practices was conducted and areas for improvement were identified. For more details about the internal review and its findings see 'Board assessment in 2021' in section 4.3.
The committee took the actions planned for 2021. Among the salient actions, it: • Kept incentives under regular review to ensure they continue to align with our strategy and drive the right culture and behaviours; and made changes to simplify remuneration schemes to ensure they are effective and fair within regulation.
• Reviewed proposals to continue to enhance our employee value proposition to attract and retain key talent, maintaining strong shareholder support as well as investors and proxy agencies’ appreciation for our thorough approach and disclosures.
• Strengthened coordination and communication with the remuneration committees of the Group’s subsidiaries, monitoring the application of corporate remuneration policies to ensure a consistent approach. The presentations from Santander UK and Santander Brasil’s Human Resources functions provided the committee with an overview of local market practices and challenges.
• Prioritized gender pay measurement across the Group and how it compared to the previous year and set targets; and reviewed internal tools to calculate the gender equality metrics more accurately and action plans to reduce the gender pay gap for the Group and its core subsidiaries.
The director remuneration policy report Pursuant to section 2 of Article 529 novodecies of the Spanish Companies Act, the remuneration committee issues this report on the resolution regarding the directors' remuneration policy for 2022, 2023 and 2024 that will be submitted by the board of directors at the 2022 AGM as a separate item on the agenda and is an integral part of this report. See section 6.4 'Directors' remuneration policy for 2022, 2023 and 2024 submitted to a binding shareholder vote' and section 6.5 'Preparatory work and decision-making for the remuneration policy; remuneration committee involvement'.
Banco Santander’s Remuneration function prepares the directors' remuneration policy based on requests, observations and suggestions it receives from the human resources committee, remuneration committee, board of directors and external advisers throughout the year (the policy for 2022, 2023 and 2024 includes suggestions from Willis Towers Watson). The remuneration committee receives a first draft of the policy every January to review and debate. During the meeting, it considers the inputs the chair and lead independent director receive through shareholder and stakeholder engagement during the year. It also considers any recommendations from regulators, legal requirements or regulation that has come to light since the last time the policy was submitted for approval at the annual general meeting. The committee also makes sure the policy is consistent with the Group's culture and Simple, Personal and Fair values. The Remuneration function then prepares the final draft for the remuneration committee to submit to the board of directors for approval in February.
The remuneration committee believes the directors' remuneration policy for 2022, 2023 and 2024 included under section 6.4 is consistent with the Group's remuneration policy and with the remuneration scheme in the Bylaws.
The directors’ remuneration policy has been reviewed, introducing several new features. It includes share options as variable remuneration instruments (along with shares) to align executive pay with shareholders’ interests. It has updated long term metrics to cover ESG aspects, RoTE and relative TSR (which was already included, but increasing the minimum threshold for pay) to be consistent with best practice and our shareholders’ and investors’ interests. Furthermore, it has reduced our annual pool metrics from four to three (i.e. customers, RoRWA and RoTE), with qualitative adjustments for risk, capital adequacy, competitor analysis, sustainable results and responsible banking commitments to sharpen our strategic focus.
2022 priorities The committee set these priorities for 2022: • Keeping incentive measures under continuous review to ensure they continue to align with our strategic aims, focus on customers and sustainable profitability and drive the right culture and behaviours, balancing the needs of our people, customers, communities, shareholders and regulators.
• Continuing to enhance our employee value proposition with a view to attracting and retaining key talent for the Group, ensuring meritocracy through a proper correlation between pay and performance, and considering the changing environment, new ways of working and the digital transformation.
• Keeping the focus on the continuous improvement and simplification of our variable remuneration schemes to maintain strong shareholder support and investors’ and proxy advisers’ appreciation.
• Increasing its coordination with the Group subsidiaries’ remuneration committees and HR teams to ensure the consistent application of corporate policies as well as mutual awareness of the Group's trends and challenges.
• Continue focusing on accelerating pay equality across the Group.

Responsible Corporate Economic and Risk management Contents banking governance financial review and compliance '2 4.8 Risk supervision, regulation and compliance committee activities in 2021 021 was a challenging year in terms of risks. Because of the challenges posed by covid-19 and the uncertain macroeconomic conditions, the committee closely oversaw the actions to manage and mitigate them. The committee also closely monitored both everyday and more strategic, non-traditional emerging risks in all subsidiaries, in full coordination with the board and other committees.
Inspired by our previous chair, we remain focused on longterm strategic risks that could ultimately compromise Banco Santander's business and risk profile. The second strategy meeting we held in June 2021 served as another forum to examine and debate such relevant emerging risks as crypto assets, new areas of business, and property and other market segments in the wake of the pandemic. The committee will pay close attention those risks and remain closely vigilant of any that emerge in the future to ensure they are properly and evenly managed in daily operations'.

Related-party transactions. 
Directors, senior managers and significant shareholders This subsection includes the report on related-party transactions mentioned under recommendation six of the Spanish Corporate Governance Code.
On 27 July 2021, the board amended the Rules and regulations of the board to adapt them to the new provisions on related-party transactions in Act 5/2021, of 12 April, (amended text of the Spanish Companies Act). See 'Rules and regulations of the board' in section 4.3.
Pursuant to the Rules and regulations of the board (as adapted to the new legal regime), the following bodies must authorise transactions between Banco Santander, S.A. or its subsidiaries and directors; shareholders who hold at least 10% of voting rights or sit on the board; and with other parties considered 'related parties' under the International Financial Reporting Standards: • The general meeting, in regard to related-party transactions that amount to 10% or more of the assets listed on the last consolidated balance sheet.
• The board of directors, in regard to the other types of related-party transactions.
However, on 27 July 2021, the board of directors (on the audit committee’s recommendation) voted to delegate to executive bodies, committees and competent proxies the approval of related-party transactions that simultaneously meet these legal requirements: • are carried out under agreements with basic standard terms that usually apply to customers contracting the product or service in question; • are entered into prices or rates set by the party acting as supplier of the goods or service in question, or arm’s length terms and conditions for commercial relations with similar customers, where the goods or services are not subject to set rates that already exist; and • they do not exceed 0.5% of Banco Santander’s net annual income as appears in the last consolidated annual accounts approved at the general shareholders’ meeting.
Likewise, the board approved an internal authorization, reporting and regular monitoring procedure, involving the audit committee, to confirm that transactions approved by virtue of the board’s delegation are fair and transparent and meet the standards that apply in the above-mentioned exceptions. The procedure requires a permanently up-to-date list of natural and legal persons concerned in related-party transactions.
Lastly, the board also approved certain categories of related-party transactions and established ideal conditions to protect company and shareholder interests. Related-party transactions will be assessed to.

If a related-party transaction must be approved at the general meeting or by the board, the audit committee must issue a preliminary report about it in accordance with the law. That preliminary report will not be necessary for related-party transactions approved by virtue of the board's delegation.
Board members must refrain from deliberating and voting on resolutions with which they or their related parties have a direct or indirect conflict of interest.
In 2021, following due diligence, no director or any other related parties according to International Financial Reporting Standards carried out transactions deemed “significant” (i.e. material to Santander and the related party) or under non-market conditions.
The audit committee confirmed that all related-party transactions in 2021 were performed correctly, after reviewing whether they complied with the law, the Rules and regulations of the board and with the conditions set forth by the board, as mentioned in the audit committee activities report under section 4.5 'Audit committee activities in 2021'.
Banco Santander also has a policy for the admission, authorisation and monitoring of loans, credits and guarantees for directors and senior managers. It sets out the procedure in place for risk transactions of which they or their related parties like spouse or other person with similar relationship; minor children or those of legal age who are economically dependent; or companies controlled by directors or senior managers whose activity is limited to the mere holding of assets and the management of personal or family assets.
Furthermore, it outlines general rules in terms of maximum borrowing, interest rates and other similar conditions to those that apply to other employees. In accordance with this policy and with banking regulations, the policy provides that loans, credits or guarantees to be granted to Banco Santander's directors and senior managers (or to their related parties) must be authorised by the board and subsequently by the ECB, except in the cases listed below: • Transactions are subject to a collective agreement signed by Banco Santander, with similar conditions to those of transactions granted to any employee.
• Transactions are carried out under agreements with standard conditions that generally apply to a large number of customers, provided that the amount granted to the beneficiary or its related parties does not exceed EUR 200,000.
Note 5.f of the 'consolidated financial statements' lists the Grupo Santander's direct risks in the form of loans, credits and guarantees extended to directors in the ordinary course of business as of 31 December 2021. The terms and conditions of these transactions are the same as those performed under market conditions or applied to other employees, and the corresponding benefits in kind are imputed to them, where applicable.
Intra-group transactions Under new laws, Banco Santander's transactions with its direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries and with other subsidiaries or investees will not be considered related-party transactions provided that no related party holds an interest in them. The rules, approval bodies and procedures that apply to intragroup transactions are the same as for transactions with customers to make sure they are conducted at market prices and conditions.
Therefore, Santander maintains control of any subsidiaries or investees that might be affected by potential related-party transactions.
Note 52 ('Related parties') in the consolidated financial statements and note 47 ('Related parties') in the individual financial statements specify the amounts of the transactions with other Group entities (subsidiaries, associates and jointly-held entities), directors, senior managers and related parties.
Conflicts of interest Banco Santander has standards and procedures to prevent conflicts of interest resulting from our activities and functions, or between us and our directors and senior managers. We also have an internal policy that provides the Grupo Santander’s employees, directors and entities with criteria to prevent and manage conflicts of interest resulting from their activities.
Directors and senior managers Our directors must adopt the necessary measures to avoid situations in which their direct or indirect interests may enter into conflict with corporate interests or their obligation towards Banco Santander.
Directors’ duty to avoid conflicts of interest requires them to fulfil certain obligations, and they must refrain from using the Banco Santander name or their role to exert undue influence on private transactions. They cannot use corporate assets and confidential information for private purposes, nor take advantage of Banco Santander’s business opportunities. Moreover, they are barred from obtaining benefits or remuneration (other than courtesies) from third parties in connection with their role; or carrying out activities, on their own behalf or that of others, that place them in a situation of effective or potential competition or permanent conflict with Banco Santander.
Directors must report direct or indirect conflicts of interest they or their related parties may have with Banco Santander to the board. Such conflicts will be disclosed in the financial statements.
In 2021, no director reported having any conflict of interest with the Group, even though these 39 abstentions occurred in votes on matters deliberated at board and committee meetings. In 12 instances, directors abstained owing to resolutions to appoint or reelect directors, or to be appointed them to board committees or to the boards of Santander companies. In 13 instances, the matter under consideration related to remuneration, loans or credits. In 4 instances, the matter was a transaction between Banco Santander and a company related to a director. In 9 instances, directors abstained regarding the annual verification of their status and suitability. In one instance, the director’s position at the meeting meant he was unable to take part in deliberations.
As directors and senior managers are subject to the Policy on conflicts of interest and the Code of Conduct in Securities Markets, they must provide the Compliance function with a statement on any relations they hold, which they must keep up to date. Directors and senior managers must also report any potential conflict of interest owing to their relations or any other reason to the Compliance function. Furthermore, where a conflict does exist, they must abstain from making decisions or casting votes, in addition to notifying anyone who is to take the respective decision.

Responsible Corporate Economic and Risk management Contents banking governance financial review and compliance. 
The chief officer of the area in question is responsible for resolving conflicts of interest. Conflicts that involve several areas must be resolved by the common senior officer. However, if none of the foregoing rules apply, the Compliance function will designate someone to resolve the conflict. In the event of doubt, the Compliance function is consulted.
The Code of Conduct in Securities Markets describes control mechanisms and bodies for resolving conflicts of interest related to securities markets. This code can be found on the Grupo Santander’s corporate website. It dictates that directors, senior managers or related parties may not carry out (i) counter-transactions on Grupo Santander ’s securities within 30 days from the time they are acquired or sold; or (ii) transactions on Grupo Santander securities 30 days before the quarterly, half-year or annual results are announced and until they are published.
Group companies Because Banco Santander is the only group company listed in Spain, no mechanisms must be in place to resolve conflicts of interest with subsidiaries listed in Spain.
If such conflicts do arise, Banco Santander, as the parent company, must consider the interests of all its subsidiaries and how they contribute to the long-term interest of the entire group. Subsidiaries should also consider the interests of Grupo Santander examine how the decisions they take may affect the Group.
Banco Santander, as the parent company of Grupo Santander, structures the governance of the Group through a system of rules that guarantees the existence of rules of governance and an adequate control system, as described in section 7. 'Group structure and internal governance'.

Responsible Corporate Economic and Risk management Contents banking governance financial review and compliance 6. Remuneration. 
Sections 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.5,6.6, 6.7, 9.4 and 9.5 comprise the annual report on directors’ remuneration that must be prepared and submitted to the consultative vote of the general shareholders' meeting.
In addition, section 6.4 y 6.5 sets out the directors' remuneration policy for 2022, 2023 and 2024, which is to be put to a vote at the general shareholders' meeting, which is binding.
The annual report on directors' remuneration and the directors' remuneration policy for 2022, 2023 and 2024 were approved by our board of directors on 24 February 2022. All directors were present at the time of vote casting and voted in favour.
The remuneration policy for directors in force as of the date of this report is available on our corporate website (2020 Annual Report, Corporate Governance, chapter 6: Remuneration).
6.1 Principles of the remuneration policy. 
Director remuneration in their capacity as such The board of directors sets the individual remuneration of directors (including executive directors) for the performance of supervisory and collective decision-making duties within the amount fixed by shareholders and commensurately with the roles they perform on the collective decision-making body, their committee membership and attendance, and other objective circumstances the board might consider.
Remuneration of directors for executive duties Banco Santander’s remuneration policy for executive duties (which also generally applies to Banco Santander employees) dictates that: 1. Remuneration must be in line with shareholders' interests, conducive to creating long-term value and compatible with our rigorous risk management, long-term strategy and values.
2. Fixed remuneration must make up a significant proportion of total compensation.
3. Variable remuneration must reward individuals for their role in achieving set goals within the framework of prudent risk management.
4. The global remuneration package and its structure must be competitive in order to attract and retain talent.
5. Remuneration decisions must be free of conflicts of interest and discrimination of any kind different from that based on the performance assessment of objectives and corporate behaviours.
Remuneration must be free of gender-based bias and help eliminate inequalities that could result from it.
The remuneration elements the policy lays down include necessary mechanisms to ensure remuneration will be conducive to achieving strategic and long-term sustainability objectives of the Bank.
Accordingly, it bases executive directors and senior managers’ variable pay on pre-determined, specific and quantifiable financial, sustainability-based and value-creation targets that are consistent with Banco Santander’s interests, including in regard to environmental, social and governance matters.
For more details, see section 6.3. about the policy's application in 2021 and section 6.4 about the remuneration policy for 2022 and subsequent years.
Lastly, the remuneration committee and the board enlisted the assistance of Willis Towers Watson to: • Compare markets and entities similar to the Group in size, characteristics and operations using relevant data for setting remuneration.
• Analyse and confirm compliance with certain quantitative metrics required to evaluate accomplishment of objectives.
• Estimate the fair value of variable remuneration linked to longterm objectives.
• Advise in the update to the remuneration policy described in section 6.4.
6.2 Remuneration of directors for supervisory and collective decision-making duties: policy applied in 2021. 
A. Composition and limits According to our Bylaws, the remuneration of directors in their roles consists of a fixed annual amount set at the general shareholders' meeting. This amount remains in effect until shareholders vote to amend it, even though the board may reduce it in the years it deems appropriate. At the annual general shareholders' meeting, remuneration for 2021 was set at EUR 6 million, which included (a) annual allotment and (b) attendance fees.
Santander has taken out a civil liability insurance policy for directors subject to usual terms proportionate to its circumstances.

In accordance with the remuneration policy approved at the general shareholders' meeting on 26 March 2021, the amounts for serving and holding roles on the board and committees was the same amount as initially approved for 2020, adding that the innovation and technology committee began to be remunerated, with its members receiving EUR 25,000 and its Chair, an additional EUR 70,000.

However, in line with the board of directors' decision (shared by Bruce Carnegie-Brown) to reduce their allotments and fees from 1 April 2020 to 31 December, the same reduction was applied to that amount.

For 2021, in the same manner as with the annual allotment, the board voted to keep the same amounts set out in the 2020 policy before the exceptional decision above, and, as foreseen in the remuneration policy approved at the general shareholders' meeting on 26 March 2021, attendance fees for innovation and technology committee members were added.

Responsible Corporate Economic and Risk management Contents banking governance financial review and compliance 6.3 Remuneration of directors for executive duties. 
The policy on directors’ remuneration for executive duties in 2021 was approved by the board of directors and put to a binding vote at the 2021 general shareholders' meeting, with 93.26% votes in favour.

He has not received any other remuneration for executive functions in Banco Santander, S.A. On 31 December 2021, Mr Rial has stepped down as CEO and vice-chair of Santander Brasil and as Regional head for South America.

B. Variable remuneration i) General policy for 2021 The board approved the executive directors’ variable remuneration on the remuneration committee’s recommendation, according to the policy approved at the general shareholders' meeting: • Variable components 22 (including the variable part of the contributions to the benefit systems) of executive directors’ total remuneration in 2021 should amount to less than 200% of fixed components, as established by resolution of the general shareholders' meeting on 26 March 2021.
• At the beginning of 2022, on the remuneration committee’s recommendation, the board approved the final amount of the 2021 incentive, based on the set bonus pool in accordance with the directors' remuneration policy approved at the general shareholders' meeting on 26 March 2021, in consideration of: • Short-term quantitative metrics measured against annual objectives.
• A qualitative assessment that cannot adjust the quantitative result by more than 25 percentage points upwards or downwards.
• Any exceptional adjustment that must be supported by evidence.
• The final figure is adjusted to executive directors’ individual variable remuneration benchmark according to the current model and (i) their individual objectives (which generally match the Group’s and cover financial, risk management and capital adequacy metrics as well as the three pillars the Group's strategy stands on: One Santander, PagoNxt and Digital Consumer Bank; and (ii) how they achieve them in consideration of how they manage employees and demonstrated the corporate values.
The payment schedule of the incentive is illustrated below.

A. Any exceptional adjustment supported by evidence. 
Quantitative metrics and qualitative assessment aspects are described below.
• Payment of the approved incentive is split equally into cash and shares. 40% is paid in 2022, once the final amount has been set. The remaining 60% will be deferred in equal parts over five years (subject to long-term metrics) as follows: • The deferred amount payable in 2023 and 2024, (24% of the total) will be paid if none of the malus clauses described below are triggered.
• The deferred amount payable in 2025, 2026 and 2027, (36% of the total) will be paid if the malus clauses are not triggered and the multi-year targets described below are reached. These targets can only reduce these amounts and the number of deferred shares (which can be lower but not higher).
• When the deferred amount is paid in cash, the beneficiary may be paid the amount adjusted for inflation up to the date of payment.
• All payments in shares are subject to a three years retention period, unless the director already holds shares for an amount equivalent to twice his/her annual fix remuneration, in which case the shares would be subject only to the regulatory one year retention period obligation.
• The hedging of Santander shares received during the retention and deferral periods is expressly prohibited. The sale of shares is also prohibited for one year from time they are received.
2022 2023 2024. 
All deferred payments can be subject to malus, even if they are not subject to long-term objectives. Similarly, Santander can claw back paid incentives in the scenarios and for the period dictated in the group’s malus and clawback policy.
ii) Quantitative metrics and qualitative assessment for 2021 Executive directors’ variable remuneration for 2021 has been based on the corporate centre executives' common bonus pool, which 2025 2026 2027 100% calculation comes from the quantitative and qualitative metrics approved by the board at the beginning of 2021 on the remuneration committee’s recommendation. This also takes into account the input received from the human resources committee, which for these purpose counts on the participation of the senior management in charge of the group's risk, compliance, audit, human resources and legal and financial accounting and control functions, who among others provided input on risk, solvency, liquidity, results' quality and 22 As indicated in the first chart in section 6.3 pension contributions include both fix and variable components, the latter of which also form part of total variable remuneration.

The following section details the individual variable remuneration approved by the board.
iii) Determination of the individual variable remuneration for executive directors set in 2021 The board approved executive directors’ variable remuneration on the remuneration committee’s recommendation based on the policy mentioned in the paragraphs above and the result of the quantitative metrics and qualitative assessment described above.
The board also verified that none of the following circumstances have occurred: • The Group’s ONP 23 for 2021 was not more than 50% less than for 2020. Otherwise, variable remuneration would not have been greater than 50% of the benchmark incentive.
• The Group’s ONP was not negative. Otherwise, the incentive would have been zero.
The board voted to maintain the same benchmark incentive for Ana Botín and José Antonio Álvarez in 2021 as in 2020.
Variable contributions to pensions were not modified in 2021, so the amounts are the 22% of the 30% of the last three assigned bonus' average.
Breakdown of immediately payable and deferred remuneration. 
Comparing with the previous year, it should be mentioned that amid the covid-19 health crisis in 2020, Ana Botín and José Antonio Álvarez proposed to reduce their total 2020 compensation (salary and bonus) by 50%.
To achieve the 50% reduction compared to 2019, the board of directors decided to apply an additional adjustment to Ana Botín’s and José Antonio Alvarez’s variable compensation, reducing the variable compensation by 74% in the case of Ana Botín and 79% in the case of José Antonio Álvarez.
In 2021, the good business performance (which enabled Banco Santander to reach a 12.73% underlying RoTE, above 2019), the excellent execution of our strategy (with the highest underlying attributable profit of the last 12 years), and efficient capital management, have improved substantially the bonus pool results, and thus the variable remuneration of corporate centre employees, including the executive directors.
The immediately payable variable remuneration in deferred amounts not contingent on long-term metrics and variable remuneration deferred and contingent on long-term objectives approved by the board of directors, following a proposal by the remuneration committee resulting from the aforementioned process are:

A. The number of shares in the table total 625 thousand shares in Banco Santander (121 thousand shares in 2020).
Fair value has been determined on the grant date based on the valuation report of an independent expert, Willis Towers Watson. Based on the design of the plan for 2021 and success levels of similar plans at peer entities, the expert found a range of 60%-80% reasonable to estimate the initial success ratio. Therefore, fair value was considered to be 70% of the maximum value.
23 For this purpose, ONP is attributed ordinary net profit, adjusted upwards or downwards for transactions the board believes have an impact not connected to the performance of evaluated directors, for which extraordinary profit, corporate transactions, impairments, or accounting or legal adjustments that may occur during the year are evaluated. The exclusion in the calculation for these purposes of goodwill impairments is aligned with the supervisors' criteria on their recommendations on dividend distributions. 24 Corresponds to the fair value of the maximum amount to be received over a total of 3 years, subject to continued service -with certain exceptions-, non- applicability of malus clauses and compliance with set goals. Fair value was estimated at the plan award date on account of several scenarios for the variables in the plan during the measurement periods.

The maximum number of shares to be delivered under the plan (2,480 thousand shares not adjusted for fair value) is within the limit of 3,705 thousand shares authorised in the 2021 AGM for executive directors. This limit was calculated with the weighted average daily volume of weighted average listing prices of Santander shares in the 15 trading sessions prior to the Friday (not inclusive) before 1 February 2022 (the date on which the board approved the 2021 bonus for executive directors), which was EUR 3.104 per share.
iv) Multi-year targets linked to the payment of deferred amounts in 2025, 2026 and 2027 The multi-year targets linked to the payment of the deferred amounts payable in 2025, 2026 and 2027 are:
Metrics Weight Target and compliance scales (metrics ratios)
A Earnings per share (EPS) growth in 2023 vs 2020 33 % If EPS in 2023 (% vs.2020) ≥ 125%, then metric ratio is 1.5 If EPS in 2023 (% vs.2020) ≥ 100% but < 125%, then metric ratio is 1 – 1.5 C. 
If EPS in 2023 (% vs. 2020) ≥ 70% but < 100%, then metric ratio is 0 – 1 C. 
If EPS in 2023 (% vs. 2020) < 70%, ratio is 0. 
B Relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) A in 2021-2023 within a peer group 33 % If ranking of Santander above percentile 66, then metric ratio is 1 If ranking of Santander between percentiles 33 and 66, then ratio is 0 – 1 D. 
If ranking of Santander below percentile 33, then metric ratio is 0. 
C Fully loaded target common equity Tier 1 ratio (CET1) B for 2023 33 % If CET1 is ≥ 12%, then metric ratio is 1 If CET1 is ≥ 11% but < 12%, then metric ratio is 0 – 1 E. 
If CET1 is < 11%, then metric ratio is 0. 
A. TSR refers to the difference (%) between the final and initial values of capital invested in ordinary shares of Banco Santander. The final value is calculated based on the dividends or other similar concepts (such as the Santander Scrip Dividend programme) shareholders receive for this investment during the corresponding period -as if they had invested in more shares of the same type at the first date on which the dividend or similar concept was payable to shareholders- and the weighted average share price at that date. To calculate TSR, the weighted average daily volumes of the weighted average listing prices for the fifteen trading sessions prior to 1 January 2021 (exclusive) is considered (to calculate the initial value) and the fifteen trading sessions prior to 1 January 2024 (exclusive) (to calculate the final value). The peer group consists of BBVA, BNP Paribas, Citi, Crédit Agricole, HSBC, ING, Itaú, Scotia Bank and Unicredit. B. To check success in terms of this objective, possible increases in CET1 resulting from capital increases will be disregarded (except in relation to the Santander Scrip Dividend programme). Furthermore, the CET1 ratio at 31 December 2023 could be adjusted to factor out the impact of any new regulations on its calculation up to that date. C. Linear increase in the EPS ratio based on the specific EPS growth rate in 2023 in respect of 2020 within this bracket of the scale. D. Proportional increase in the TSR ratio based on the number of positions moved up in the ranking. E. Linear increase in the CET1 ratio as a function of the CET1 ratio in 2023 within this bracket of the scale.
To determine the annual amount of the deferred portion linked to objectives corresponding to each board member in 2025, 2026 and • 'B' is the TSR ratio according to the scale in the table above, 2027, the following formula shall be applied to each of these according to the relative performance of Banco Santander’s TSR payments ('Final annuity') without prejudice to any adjustment within its peer group in 2021-2023.
deriving from the malus clauses: • 'C' is the CET1 ratio according to compliance with the CET1 target. 
Final annuity = Amt. x (1/3 x A + 1/3 x B + 1/3 x C) for 2023 described in the table above.

25 When the beneficiary’s relationship with Banco Santander or another group entity terminates because of retirement, early retirement or pre-retirement; a dismissal ruled by the courts to be wrongful; unilateral withdrawal for good cause by an employee (which includes the situations set forth in article 10.3 of Royal Decree 1382/1985, of 1 August, governing the special relationship of senior management, for the persons subject to these rules); permanent disability or death; mandatory redundancy; or because an employer other than Banco Santander ceases to belong to Santander Group, the right to receive shares and deferred amounts in cash and any amounts of the deferred amounts in cash adjusted for inflation will remain under the same conditions in force as if none of such circumstances had occurred. In the case of death, the right will pass to the beneficiary’s heirs. In cases of justified temporary leave due to temporary disability, suspension of contract due to maternity or paternity leave, or leave to care for children or a relative, there will be no change in the beneficiary’s rights. If the beneficiary goes to another group company (even through international assignment and/or expatriation), these rights will likewise not change. If the relationship terminates by mutual agreement or because the beneficiary obtains a leave not mentioned above, the terms of the termination or temporary leave agreement will apply. None of those circumstances attach the right to receive the deferred amount in advance. If beneficiaries or their heirs maintain the right to receive deferred pay in shares and cash and any deferred amounts in cash adjusted for inflation, it will be delivered within the periods and under the terms dictated by the rules for the plans. None of the above circumstances shall give the right to receive the deferred amount in advance. If the beneficiary or the successors thereof maintain the right to receive the deferred remuneration in shares and cash and, where applicable, the amounts arising from the adjustment for inflation of the deferred amounts in cash, it shall be delivered within the periods and under the terms provided in the rules for the plans.

Similarly, Banco Santander can clawback any paid variable amounts in the scenarios and for the period dictated by the terms and conditions in the said policy.
Variable remuneration for 2021 can be clawed back until the beginning of 2028.
Malus and clawback clauses are triggered by poor financial performance of Banco Santander, a division or area, or exposures from staff as a result of an executive(s)’s management of, at least, one of these factors:
Category Factors. 
Significant failures in risk management by Banco Risk Santander, or by a business or risk control unit.
An increase in capital requirements at the Banco Capital Santander or one of its business units not planned at the time that exposure was generated.
Regulatory penalties or legal convictions for events that might be attributable to the unit or Regulation and staff responsible for them. In addition, failure to internal codes comply with Banco Santander’s internal codes of conduct.
Improper conduct, whether individual or collective. Negative effects deriving from the Conduct marketing of unsuitable products and the liability of persons or bodies making such decisions will be considered especially significant.
The application of malus or clawback clauses for executive directors shall be determined by the board of directors, at the proposal of the remuneration committee, and cannot be proposed once the retention period for the final payment in shares under the plan has elapsed in early 2028. Therefore, the board determines the specific deferred incentive amount to be paid as well as any amount that could be subject to clawback, upon on the remuneration committee’s recommendation and depending on the level of compliance with the conditions for applying malus clauses, .
C. Main features of the benefit plans Executive directors participate in the defined contribution pension scheme created in 2012, which covers contingencies due to retirement, disability and death.
José Antonio Álvarez's contract has been updated in 2020 so that he has ceased to have the right to early retirement in case of termination of his contract. Ana Botín has ceased to have the right to voluntary early retirement, keeping this right if Banco Santander terminates her contract before 31 August 2022, after which early retirement will no longer be available. As long as she retains that right, she is entitled to an annual allotment equal to her total fixed remuneration, plus 30% of the average of up to her last three variable pays.
According to the 2012 system, contracts for executive directors (and other senior managers) with defined benefit pension obligations were transformed into a defined contribution system. The new system gives executive directors the right to receive benefits upon retirement, even if they are not active at Banco Santander at the time, based on contributions to the system. It also replaces their previous right to receive a pension supplement in the event of retirement.
The initial amount for each executive director in the new defined contribution pension scheme corresponded to the market value of the assets for which the provisions for due obligations were recognized when the previous pension commitments had been transferred to the new pension scheme.
Every year since 2013, Banco Santander has been contributing to the pension scheme for executive directors and senior executives in proportion to their pensionable bases until their departure from the group, retirement, death or disability (even during pre-retirement). The pensionable base for executive directors is the sum of fixed remuneration plus 30% of the average of their last three variable remuneration amounts. Contributions will be 22% of pensionable bases in all cases.
Pursuant to remuneration regulations, contributions calculated on the basis of variable remuneration are subject to the discretionary pension benefits scheme. Therefore, under the policy, malus and clawback clauses can be enforced on them in place at any given time and during the same period in which variable remuneration is deferred. Furthermore, these contributions must be invested in shares in Banco Santander for five years from the date of the executive director's retirement, or from the date on which executive directors leave the group. Once that period has elapsed, the amount invested in shares will be paid to them or their beneficiaries if some contingency covered by the pension scheme was happened or will be added to the remainder of their cumulative balance until their retirement age when the total amount will be paid.
The benefit plan is outsourced to Santander Seguros y Reaseguros, Compañía Aseguradora, S.A. The economic rights of the directors previously mentioned belong to them even if they are not active at Banco Santander at the time of their retirement, death or disability. Their contracts do not stipulate any severance payment outside the extent of the law for termination of contract or the aforementioned annual allowance for pre-retirement.
The provisions recognised in 2021 for retirement pensions amounted to 1,825 thousand euros (2,019 thousand euros in 2020), as broken down below.

Ana Botín 1,041 1,155.

José Antonio Álvarez 18,821 18,082. 
Total 66,896 67,526. 
D. Other remuneration Grupo Santander also takes out insurance policies for life, health and other contingencies for its executive directors. This other remuneration component includes the fixed supplement approved for Ana Botín and José Antonio Álvarez to replace the supplementary benefits from the pension scheme eliminated in 2018, in addition to the cost for insuring death or disability until they retire. Executive directors are also covered under the group’s civil liability insurance policy.
Note 5 to the group’s consolidated financial statements describes other benefits received by executive directors in detail.

E. Shareholdings In 2016, on the remuneration committee’s recommendation, the board of directors approved a shareholding policy to better align executive directors with shareholders’ long-term interests.
According to this policy, in addition to the executive directors’ commitment to maintaining a significant holding of shares in the group for as long as they have their role, executive directors active on 1 January 2016 would have five years to demonstrate that their personal assets include shares in Banco Santander that amount (net of taxes) to twice their gross annual salary on that date. Executive directors have complied with this policy. The following table show the ratio, with a share price at 31 December 2021 of 2.94 euros: 2021 2020. 
Gross Gross annual number of annual number of salary (thousand) shares (thousand) X salary (thousand) shares (thousand) X.

CEO 2,541 1,985 2.3 2,541 1,821 2.1. 
Likewise, in addition to the regulatory obligation for executive directors not to sell the shares they receive as remuneration for a year from their award, which is included in the shareholding policy, and will apply to all cases, this policy has also been updated to include the obligation for executive directors not to sell the shares they receive as remuneration for a period of three years from their award date, unless the executive director already holds Banco Santander shares for an amount equivalent to twice his/her fix annual remuneration.

G. Remuneration of board members as representatives of Banco Santander The executive committee has resolved that the remuneration received by directors who represent Banco Santander on boards of companies where it owns equity and were appointed after 18 March 2002 will accrue to the group. No executive director received remuneration for this type of representation in 2021 or 2020.
However, in their personal capacity, in 2021 Álvaro Cardoso was paid BRL 2,130 thousand (EUR 334 thousand) as non-executive chair of Banco Santander Brasil, S.A., Homaira Akbari was paid USD 190 thousand (EUR 161 thousand) as member of the board of Santander Consumer USA (SCUSA) and EUR 52 thousand as member of the Board of PagoNxt, and Henrique de Castro and R.Martín Chávez were each paid the same EUR 52 thousand as members of the board of PagoNxt. Likewise, Pamela Walkden was paid GBP 31 thousand (EUR 36 thousand) as member of Santander UK plc and Santander UK Group Holdings boards.
Likewise, Luis Isasi was paid EUR 1,000 thousand for his roles as nonexecutive chair and for board and committees meetings (amount included in the chart below as "other remuneration" as it is paid by Banco Santander, S.A.).

J. Summary of link between risk, performance and remuneration Banco Santander's remuneration policy and its application in 2021 have promoted sound and effective risk management, at the same time as supported the fulfilment of long-term business objectives.
The key elements of the remuneration policy for executive directors making alignment between risk, performance and reward in 2021 were as follows:
Key words Aspect aligning risk, performance and remuneration. 
The balance of quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments, including customer, risk, capital and profitability Metrics balance in relation to risk, used to determine the executive directors’ variable remuneration.
The adjustment to variable remuneration if certain financial thresholds are not reached, which may limit the Financial thresholds variable remuneration to 50% of the previous year's amount or lead to it not being awarded at all.
The long-term objectives linked to the last three portions of the deferred variable remuneration. These objectives Long-term objectives are directly associated with return to shareholders relative to a peer group, earnings per share and maintaining a sound capital base.
The discretion of the board to consider the performance of each executive director in the award of their individual Individual performance variable remuneration.
Variable remuneration cap 200% of fixed remuneration.
The work undertaken by the human resources committee aided by senior managers leading Control functions in Control functions involvement relation to the analysis of quantitative metrics information and undertaking qualitative analysis. 
Malus can be applied to unvested deferred pay and clawback can be applied to vested or paid compensation under Malus and clawback the conditions dictated by the group’s remuneration policy.
Payment in shares At least 50% of variable pay is in shares and subject to retention for at least one year from their delivery.
6.4 Directors' remuneration policy for 2022, 2023 and 2024 submitted to a binding shareholder vote. 
Remuneration policy principles and remuneration system. 
A. Directors’ remuneration in their capacity as such. 
Director’s remuneration is regulated by article 58 of Banco Santander’s bylaws and article 33 of the Rules and regulations of the board of directors. For 2022, 2023 and 2024, no changes to the principles and composition of directors’ remuneration for supervisory and collective decision-making duties are planned with respect of those in 2021. They are described in sections 6.1 and 6.2.
B. Executive directors' remuneration. 
Executive directors are entitled to be paid the remuneration (e.g., salaries, incentives, bonuses, severance payments for early termination from such duties, and amounts to be paid by Banco Santander for insurance premiums or contributions to savings schemes) deemed appropriate for performing executive functions following a proposal from the remunerations committee and by resolution of the board of directors, subject to the limits set by law.
For 2022, 2023 and 2024, several changes to the principles of executive directors’ remuneration for executive duties are planned ( sections 6.1 and 6.3).
First, to simplify the variable remuneration scheme, the proposal is to reduce the number of metrics in the bonus scorecard from the four applied in 2021 to three (30% for customers; 40% for RoRWA; and 30% for RoTE) to focus more on the Group's strategic priorities of customers and profitability, assuring adequate risk management and efficient use of capital.
The qualitative assessment for the scorecard will be conformed by the same metrics as in 2021, but adding CET1, to acknowledge the importance of having sufficient capital to support the bank’s strategy even in the event of severe stress.
Second, to create a stronger alignment with shareholder returns, it is proposed to introduce options as a remuneration instrument.
Accordingly, the variable remuneration of Banco Santander's identified staff would be 50% in cash, 25% in shares and 25% in share options, instead of 50% in cash and 50% in shares under the current scheme. Executive directors would also be allowed to choose to receive only options, so their variable remuneration would be 50% in cash and 50% in share options.
Options will not include any premium, as they will be valued at fair market price at the moment when they are awarded. So the executives' exposure to shareholders' return is amplified by the effect of the evolution of the share price both positively and negatively.
Third, it is proposed to update the long-term performance metrics according to market best practice and our stakeholders’ preferences, prioritising shareholder returns and the Group's profitability in the long-term, as well as sustainability of the balance sheet and its activities and how they are carried out. Therefore: • Relative performance of Banco Santander's total shareholder return (TSR) compared to our peer group will remain; however, the threshold at which executives begin to accrue remuneration is increased from 33% to 40%. Its weight will be 40% of the total.
• Return on tangible equity (RoTE), as an indication of long-term value creation. Its weight will be 40% of the total.
• Five ESG (environmental, social and governance) metrics linked to the progress we make on our commitments to implement the Group's Responsible banking agenda. Their weight will be 20% of the total. For additional details about our public commitments, please see Responsible banking section.
As shown below in the 'Deferred variable remuneration linked to long-term objectives' section, the maximum achievement ratio is also increased from 100% to 125% so executives have the incentive to exceed their targets; however, the maximum achievement ratio for.

Responsible Corporate Economic and Risk management Contents banking governance financial review and compliance effectively paid remuneration will not exceed the thresholds approved at the AGM.
Additionally, with the aim of providing a strong alignment with PagoNxt's success, the executive Chair and the chief executive officer will be able to receive restricted share units (RSUs) of PagoNxt, S.L.
The RSUs will substitute part of their Santander variable pay instruments without increasing their total pay and will not represent more than 10% of their variable pay.
Specifically, as regards 2022, Ana Botín would receive the equivalent of EUR 608 thousand in RSUs, and José Antonio Álvarez would receive the equivalent of EUR 410 thousand in RSUs, under PagoNxt, S.L.'s long term incentive plan. Each RSU would grant the right to a share in PagoNxt, S.L. or the holding entity of its group (or its equivalent in cash) at the moment when, according to such plan, a liquidity event, a repurchase or a liquidation of such instruments takes place.
This plan is subject to the same principles of risk alignment, variable remuneration caps, deferrals and malus and clawback as the incentive which applies to executive directors described herein, but with payment being done in PagoNxt instruments. It is also subject to specific objectives of PagoNxt, the main of which is the completion of its corporate restructuring for 2022.
Finally, every year, Banco Santander conducts a comparative analysis of total compensation for executive directors and other senior executives. For 2022, the analysis will consist of a 'peer group' made up by BBVA, BNP Paribas, Citi, Crédit Agricole, HSBC, ING, Itaú, Scotia Bank and Unicredit.
Principle of equal pay for equal work and equal employment conditions for Santander executives and employees Santander applies the equal pay principle in the Corporate remuneration policy of Grupo Santander for executive directors and employees alike, which forbids any type of differential treatment that is not exclusively based on an assessment of performance results and corporate behaviours, and promotes equal pay for men and women.
Furthermore, our remuneration framework rewards Santander employees for their contribution based on such common principles as: • Meritocracy: Non-discrimination based on sex, age, culture, religion or ethnicity.
• Consistency: Remuneration consistent with the level of responsibility, leadership and performance within the Group, to promote retention of key professionals and attract the best talent.
• Sustainability: A remuneration framework that is sustainable in terms of associated costs, cost control, and related objectives (as described in the policy) that ensure variable remuneration is commensurate with the Group's performance, disincentivize shortterm commitment and promote long-term sustainability. The remuneration scheme for the c. 1,000 identified staff also includes deferral of up to 60% of variable remuneration, its payment 25% in Santander shares and 25% in Santander share options (also subject to one-year retention), and malus and clawback clauses.
Also, performance objectives for annual variable remuneration have included since 2020 ESG components aligned with our Responsible banking commitments. From 2022, with the purpose of increasing focus on the group's Responsible banking agenda and highlight sustainability as a core long-term strategy, five new ESG metrics are included (described in the next section) for the last deferred variable remuneration payments.
• Social responsibility: Employees’ pay cannot be lower than the legal minimum wage or the living wage in the country where they work. Additionally, in order to give our social responsibility prominence in remuneration, the Group’s Responsible banking objectives for employee remuneration include the people financially empowered metric.
• Performance-based pay: Variable remuneration is subject to the achievement of (i) annual objectives (set out in section 6.4.B.ii.B), which reflect customer and profitability strategy, promote proper risk management and cost-effective capital allocation, and discourage short-term management focus; and (ii) long-term objectives (set out in section 6.4.B.ii.B), which support a sustainable balance sheet, shareholder return, the Group’s profitability and sustainability of the Group's activities and the way they are carried out.
Directors’ remuneration for 2022. 
A. Directors' remuneration in their capacity as such In 2022, directors, in their capacity as such, will receive remuneration for supervisory and collective decision-making duties for a total of up to 6 million euros as authorised by the shareholders at the April 2021 AGM (which will again be put to a vote at the 2022 AGM). It consists of: • annual allocation; and • attendance fees.
The amounts agreed for 2022 are the same as initially established for 2021 (disclosed in section 6.2.B and C above), with the exception of the annual board member allotment (which is to increase from EUR 90,000 to EUR 95,000).
The specific amounts and the form of payment are determined by the board of directors in the manner described in section 6.2 above, based on the objective circumstances of each director.
Additionally, as indicated in the description of the director remuneration system, Banco Santander will pay its directors’ the corresponding civil liability insurance premium in 2022. The related policy is common to all executives and was taken out under usual market condition, proportionate to Banco Santander's situation.
B. Executive directors' remuneration for the performance of executive duties i) Fixed remuneration components. 
A) Gross annual salary On the remuneration committee’s recommendation, the board resolved that Ana Botín and José Antonio Álvarez’s gross annual salaries would be the same for 2022 as in 2021.
Their gross annual salary amounts may increase owing to adjustments made to the fixed remuneration mix based on the criteria approved by the remuneration committee, provided this does not entail any cost increase for Banco Santander.

Responsible Corporate Economic and Risk management Contents banking governance financial review and compliance. 
B) Other fixed remuneration components • Benefit systems: defined contribution schemes as set out in section 'Pre-retirement and benefit schemes' 26 .
• Supplement to fixed salary: Ana Botín will receive the fixed salary supplement for an amount of EUR 525 thousand in 2022, and José Antonio Álvarez, EUR 710 thousand, that was approved in 2018 when the supplementary death and disability pension schemes were eliminated.
• Social welfare benefits: executive directors will also receive social welfare benefits such as life insurance premiums, medical insurance and the allocation of remuneration to employee loans, in accordance with Banco Santander’s general policy for senior management, and in the same terms as the rest of employees. Likewise, the Bank makes available to directors the human and material means required or considered appropriate for carrying out their duties (including any travel required for the exercise of their role). Any eventual private use of these means by the executive directors is duly paid by them under the terms and conditions approved by the board of directors upon proposal from the remuneration committee. This information can also be found under the 'Pre-retirement and benefit plans' section ii) Variable remuneration components The board approved the policy on executive directors’ variable remuneration for 2022 on the remuneration committee's recommendation, based on the remuneration policy principles described under section 6.3.
Executive directors’ variable remuneration consists of a single incentive scheme, linked to the achievement of short-and long-term objectives. It is structured as follows: • The final amount of variable remuneration will be set at the start of the following year (2023) based on the benchmark amount and subject to compliance with the annual objectives described under section B) below.
• 40% of the incentive will be paid immediately once the final amount has been set, and 60% will be deferred in equal parts paid out over five years and subject to long-term metrics: • The amount deferred over the first two years (24% of the total) will be paid in 2024 and 2025 on the condition that no malus clauses described under section 6.3 B vi) are triggered.
• The amount deferred over the next three years (36% of the total) will be paid in 2026, 2027 and 2028, on the condition that no malus clauses are triggered and long-term targets –described in section D) Deferred incentive subject to long-term performance objectives– are met.
The Group can claw back incentives already paid in the cases and during the term set out in its malus and clawback policy, described under section 6.3 B vi).
Exceptionally, when a new executive director joins Banco Santander, his/her variable pay may include a sign-on bonus and/or buyouts.
Variable components in executive directors’ total remuneration for 2022 cannot exceed the limit of 200% of fixed components submitted for approval to the 2022 AGM. However, under EU regulations on remuneration, certain variable components can be excluded.
A. Variable remuneration benchmark Variable remuneration for executive directors in 2022 will be set based on a standard benchmark contingent upon the full achievement of their set individual targets, which for 2022 among others include, both for the executive chair and the CEO, increasing CET1 and sustainability targets.
The board of directors may revise the variable pay benchmark on the remuneration committee’s recommendation and following market and internal contribution criteria.
B. Setting of final variable remuneration based on yearly results Based on that standard benchmark, 2022 variable remuneration for executive directors will be based on the corporate bonus pool, and set according to: • Short-term quantitative metrics for annual objectives, which reduce from the four used in 2021 to three (customers, RoTE and RoRWA) to reflect strategic priorities regarding customers and profitability.
• A qualitative assessment that cannot raise or lower the quantitative result by more than 25%, which among other elements includes metrics on capital and progress on ESG commitments.
• An exceptional adjustment that must be supported by duly substantiated evidence and may involve changes owing to control and/or risk deficiencies, negative assessments from supervisors or unexpected material events.
Capital continues to be an important part of key employees´ remuneration (including executive directors), due to the management of RWA (RoRWA metric weights 40%), the inclusion of CET1 in the qualitative assessment below and also the individual targets of the executive chair, the CEO and all executives running businesses.
26 As indicated in the next section, executive directors contribution to the benefit systems includes both fixed and variable components.

A. Net promoter score. B.For this purpose, these metrics may be adjusted upwards or downwards by the board, following a proposal from the remuneration committee, when inorganic transactions, material changes to the Group’s composition or size or other extraordinary circumstances (such as impairments, share buybacks, legal changes or restructuring procedures) have occurred which affect the suitability of the metric and achievement scale established in each case and resulting in an impact not related to the performance of the executive directors and executives being evaluated.
Lastly, as additional conditions for determining the incentive, the following circumstances must be confirmed to set variable pay: • If the Group’s ONP for 2022 were 50% less than in 2021, variable pay would in no case exceed 50% of the benchmark incentive for 2022.
• If the Group’s ONP were negative, the incentive would be zero.
When setting individual bonuses, the board will also consider restrictions to the dividend policy imposed by supervisors.
C) Forms of payment of the incentive Variable remuneration will be 50% in cash, 25% in shares and 25% in share options. One portion is paid in 2023 and the other is deferred for five years and subject to long-term metrics: a) 40% of variable remuneration is paid in 2023 net of tax, with 50% in cash, 25% in shares and 25% in share options.
b) 60% paid, if applicable, in five equal parts in 2024, 2025, 2026, 2027 and 2028 (net of tax), with 50% in cash, 25% in shares and 25% in share options under the conditions stipulated in section E).
The final three payments will also be subject to long-term objectives described in section D) below.
Shares shall be subject to a three-years retention period, unless the executive directors already hold shares for an amount equivalent to 200% of their fix annual remuneration -in which case the regulatory one year retention period will apply. For share options, the retention period applied will be in accordance with the rules of the plan approved by the board of directors to comply with applicable regulations and regulatory recommendations.
Options will not include any premium, as they will be valued at fair market price at the moment when they are awarded. They may be exercised from the moment they are delivered to the executive, in accordance with the deferral calendar above, and until the tenth anniversary of the date when they are delivered.
D) Deferred variable pay subject to long-term objectives As indicated above, the amounts deferred in 2026, 2027 and 2028 will be paid on the condition that the group achieves its long-term targets for 2022-2024, in addition to the terms described in section E).
As advanced in section B) on the principles of the remuneration policy, the new long-term targets are: a. Banco Santander’s consolidated Return on tangible equity (RoTE) target in 2024. The RoTE ratio for this target is obtained as follows:
RoTE in 2024 (%) ‘RoTE Ratio' ≥ 15% 1.5 ≥ 12% but < 15% 0 – 1.5 A < 12% 0. 
A. Straight-line increase in the RoTE ratio based on the percentage of specific RoTE in 2024 within this bracket of the scale.
To verify compliance with this objective, the board, following a proposal from the remuneration committee, may adjust it to remove the effects of any regulatory change to its calculation rules or any extraordinary circumstances (such as impairments, corporate transactions, share buybacks or restructuring procedures) that have occurred which affect the suitability of the metric and achievement scale established in each case and resulting in an impact not related to the performance of the executive directors and executives being evaluated.
b. Relative performance of Banco Santander's total shareholder return (TSR) in 2022-2024 in respect of the weighted TSR of a peer group comprising 9 credit institutions, with the appropriate TSR ratio based on the group’s TSR among its peers.

It is the sum NZBA: of the change in share price plus dividends and other similar items (including the Santander Scrip Dividend programme) shareholders can receive during the period.
The peer group comprises BBVA, BNP Paribas, Citi, Credit Agricole, HSBC, ING, Itaú, Scotiabank and Unicredit.
c. ESG (environmental, social and governance) metrics.
Achievement of this target will depend on the progress made on the Group's responsible banking commitments (described below): 1.Target for women in senior leadership positions by the end of 2024:
Women in senior leadership positions B (%) Coefficient ≥ 30.5% 1.25 ≥ 30% but < 30.5% 1 – 1.25 A ≥ 28% but < 30% 0 – 1 A < 28% 0. 
A. Increase of the coefficient is proportional to its position on this line of the scale. B. Senior leadership positions make up 1% of the total workforce 2. Financially empowered people target between 2019 and 2024:
Financially empowered people B (million) Coefficient ≥ 14 1.25 ≥ 13 but < 14 1 – 1.25 A ≥ 9 but < 13 0 – 1 A < 9 0. 
A. Increase of the coefficient is proportional to its position on this line of the scale. B.Unbanked, underbanked or financially vulnerable individuals receive tailored finance solutions and can increase their knowledge and resilience through financial education. More ambitious target than the public commitment announced due to the good performance of this metric. Furthermore, our financial inclusion target will always conform to the Group’s credit risk policy without altering loanbook performance. The public commitment is measured with cumulative data since 2019 to align with our 2019-2025 responsible banking public commitments.
3.Green finance raised and facilitated target between 2019 and 2024:
Green Finance B (EUR Bn) Coefficient ≥ 170 1.25 ≥ 160 but < 170 1 – 1.25 A ≥ 120 but < 160 0 – 1 A < 120 0. 
A. Increase of the coefficient is proportional to its position on this line of the scale. B. Includes Grupo Santander's contribution to green finance: project finance; syndicated loans; green bonds; capital finance; export finance, advisory services, structuring and other products, to help customers transition to a low-carbon economy. Includes the public commitment and the launch of new products and green retail volumes. The public commitment is measured with cumulative data since 2019 to align with our 2019-2025 responsible banking public commitments.
Sectors with decarbonisation targets (number) Coefficient ≥ 11 1.25 =10 1 ≥ 0 but <10 0 – 1 A. 
A. Increase of the coefficient is proportional to its position on this line of the scale.
The Group is working on aligning our climate-material portfolios with the goals of the Paris Agreement. In 2021, we set decarbonization targets for the coal and electricity generation industries, based on our ambition to be net zero by 2050. In February, we made our decarbonization targets public with a view to end financing for electricity-generating customers if the source of over 10% of their revenue is thermal coal; and to eliminating our exposure to coal mining entirely by 2030. In July 2021, we announced a new decarbonization target to reduce the emissions intensity of our electricity generation portfolio. As part of the NZBA, we have the obligation to set and announce interim emissions-related targets for 2030 (or sooner) regarding these ten industries by March 2024: electricity generation; coal; oil and gas, transport; iron and steel; aluminium; cement; mortgage lending; property; and agriculture (subject to the availability of data and methodologies, in line with our commitment to NZBA). To meet NZBA guidelines, we must disclose, at least, one target for portfolios of each of those ten industries.
5.Meeting the decarbonisation target set for Santander Power Generation Portfolio:
Emission intensity reduction of our power generation portfolio (%) Coefficient ≥ 18.75% 1.25 ≥ 15% but < 18.75% 1 – 1.25 A ≥ 0% B but < 15% 0 – 1 A. 
A. Increase of the coefficient is proportional to its position on this line of the scale. B. In case emission intensity increase, the coefficient would be 0.
This commitment aims to make sure we succeed in lowering the emissions intensity of our electricity generation portfolio from 0.23 tCO2e/MWh (2019) to 0.18 tCO2e/MWh by 2025 and 0.11 tCO2e/ MWh by 2030, in accordance with the “IEA – Net Zero emissions” scenario. From the 2019 baseline scenario of 0.23, a 21.7% emissions reduction is necessary to reach the 2025 target of 0.18. Cutting emissions from 2019 by between 15% and 18.75% will put us on the right path with momentum to reach the targets for our electricity generation portfolio by 2025 and 2030.
Each of the five Responsible banking commitments have the same weighting and this formula to calculate them:
C = (1/5 x Coefficient 1 + 1/5 x Coefficient 2 + 1/5 x Coefficient 3 +1/5 x Coefficient 4 +1/5 x Coefficient 5 )
TSR refers to the difference (%) between the final and initial values of capital invested in ordinary shares of Banco Santander. The final value is calculated based on the dividends or other similar concepts (such as the Santander Scrip Dividend programme) shareholders receive for this investment during the corresponding period -as if they had invested in more shares of the same type at the first date on which the dividend or similar concept was payable to shareholders- and the weighted average share price at that date. To calculate TSR, the weighted average daily volumes of the weighted average listing prices for the fifteen trading sessions prior to 1 January 2022 (exclusive) is considered (to calculate the initial value) and the fifteen trading sessions prior to 1 January 2025 (exclusive) (to calculate the final value).

Responsible Corporate Economic and Risk management Contents banking governance financial review and compliance. 
The following formula will be used to set the annual amount of performance-based deferred variable remuneration in 2026, 2027 and 2028 ('Final annuity'), without prejudice to any adjustment deriving from the application of the malus policy (see section 6.3 B vi):
Final annuity = Amt. x (2/5 x A + 2/5 x B + 1/5 x C) where: • 'Amt.' is one third of variable remuneration deferred conditional on performance (i.e. Amt. will be 12% of the total incentive set in early 2023).
• ‘A' is the RoTE coefficient according to the scale in the table above, based on RoTE at year-end 2024.
• 'B' is the TSR ratio calculated as the scale in the table above, according to the relative performance of Banco Santander’s TSR within its peer group in 2022-2024.
• ‘C’ is the coefficient resulting from the sum of weighted coefficients for each of the five Responsible banking commitments for 2024 (see section (c) above).
• In any event, if the result of (2/5 x A + 2/5 x B +1/5 x C) is greater than 1.25, the multiplier will be 1.25.
The estimated maximum amount to be delivered in shares or share options to executive directors is 11.5 million euros.
E) Other terms of the incentive Payment of the deferred amounts (including those linked to longterm targets) if they remain in the group and none of the circumstances triggering malus clauses arising (as per the malus and clawback section in the group’s remuneration policy) under terms similar to those indicated for 2021. Furthermore, the group can claw back paid incentives under the scenarios, period and terms and conditions set out in the remuneration policy.
Hedging the value of Santander shares or share options received during the retention and deferral periods is expressly prohibited.
The effect of inflation on the deferred amounts in cash may be offset.
Selling shares is also prohibited for at least one year since the delivery. Shares received by the exercise of options, as well as cash proceeds deriving from exercise by differences, will be in accordance with the rules of the plan approved by the board of directors. .
The remuneration committee may propose to the board adjustments in variable remuneration under exceptional circumstances owing to internal or external factors, such as requirements, orders or recommendations issued by regulatory or supervisory bodies. Such adjustments will be described in detail in the report on the remuneration committee and the annual report on directors’ remuneration put to a non-binding vote at the annual general meeting.
iv. Shareholdings As described in section 6.3.E, in addition to the regulatory obligation not to sell shares they receive as remuneration for a year since from their award date, in order to comply with recommendation 62 of the Spanish Corporate Governance Code, the policy on shareholdings includes the obligation for executive directors not to sell the shares they receive as variable remuneration for a period of three years from their award date, unless the executive director already holds Banco. 
Santander shares for an amount equivalent to twice his/her annual salary. For share options, the retention period applied will be in accordance with the rules of the plan approved by the board of directors to comply with applicable regulations and regulatory recommendations.
Directors’ remuneration for 2023 and 2024. 
A. Directors’ remuneration For 2023 and 2024, no changes to directors’ remuneration are planned for 2022. However, shareholders at the 2023 or 2024 annual general meeting could approve an amount higher than the six million euros currently in force, or the board could approve an alternative allocation of that amount to directors in accordance with article 58.2 of Banco Santander’s Bylaws (duties and responsibilities; positions held on the board; their membership and attendance at committee meetings; and other objective circumstances).
B. Directors' remuneration for the performance of executive duties Executive directors’ remuneration will conform to principles similar to those applied in 2022, with the following changes.
i. Fixed components of remuneration. 
A) Gross annual salary Executive directors’ annual gross fixed pay may be adjusted each year based on the criteria approved by the remuneration committee at any given time. For 2023 and 2024, it may not increase above 5% of their annual gross salary in the previous year. It could also increase over that threshold owing to adjustments made to the fixed remuneration mix based on standards approved by the remuneration committee, as long as it will not increase the Group’s costs.
The 5% increase mentioned above may be higher for one or several directors provided that, when applying the rules or requirements or supervisory recommendations that may be applicable, and if so proposed by the remuneration committee, it is appropriate to adjust their remuneration mix and, in particular, their variable remuneration, in view of the functions they perform.
This should not increase executive directors’ total remuneration. Otherwise, it must be disclosed in the report on the remuneration committee and the annual report on director's remuneration put to a non-binding vote at annual general meeting.
B) Other fixed remuneration components No changes planned in respect of the terms for 2022.
ii) Variable remuneration components The policy on executive directors’ variable remuneration for 2023 and 2024 will be based on the same principles as in 2022, following the same single-incentive scheme described above, and subject to the same rules of operation and limitations.
A) Setting variable remuneration Executive directors’ variable remuneration for 2023 and 2024 will be set based on the corporate bonus pool and a benchmark approved for each year which takes into account: • a set of short-term quantitative metrics measured against annual objectives and aligned with the group’s strategic plan. These metrics will also cover, at least, shareholder return targets, capital and customers. They can be measured at group level and, where applicable, at division level, for a specific business division headed by an executive director. The results of each metric can be.

Responsible Corporate Economic and Risk management Contents banking governance financial review and compliance contrasted with the budget for the financial year, as well as with growth from the previous year.
• a qualitative assessment that cannot raise or lower the quantitative result by more than 25%. It will be conducted for the same categories as the quantitative metrics, including shareholder returns, risk and capital management and customers.
• an exceptional adjustment that must be duly substantiated and may involve changes owing to control and/or risk shortfalls, negative assessments from supervisors or unexpected material events.
The quantitative metrics, qualitative assessment and potential extraordinary adjustments will ensure main objectives are considered from the perspective of the various stakeholders and that the importance of risk and capital management is factored in.
Once the corporate bonus pool is fixed according to the criteria above, the board of directors, further to a proposal from the remunerations committee, decides on the individual bonus, taking into consideration the level of achievement of their individual objectives, which in general terms coincide with the bonus pool metrics (60%) and their compliance with corporate values (40%).
Lastly, the following circumstances must be confirmed to set variable remuneration: • If ONP does not reach a certain compliance threshold, the incentive cannot exceed 50% of the year’s incentive benchmark.
• If the group’s ONP were negative, the incentive would be zero.
• When setting individual variable pay, the board will also consider restrictions to the dividend policy imposed by supervisors.
B) Forms of payment of the incentive No changes to pay forms are planned in respect of the terms in place for 2022.
It is also envisaged that for 2023 and 2024 Ana Botín would receive the equivalent of EUR 500 thousand in RSUs, and José Antonio Álvarez would receive the equivalent of EUR 410 thousand in RSUs, under PagoNxt, S.L.'s long term incentive plan. Each RSU would grant the right to a share in PagoNxt, S.L. or the holding entity of its group (or its equivalent in cash) at the moment when, according to such plan, a liquidity event, a repurchase or a liquidation of such instruments takes place.
The RSUs will substitute part of their Santander variable pay instruments without increasing their total pay and will not represent more than 10% of their variable pay.
C) Deferred variable remuneration subject to long-term objectives The last three annual payments of each deferred variable remuneration amount will be made in accordance with the terms described under section E) above and if the Group fulfils long-term objectives for at least three years. This may confirm, reduce or increase payment amounts and the number of deferred shares.
Long-term metrics will, at least, cover value creation and shareholder returns as well as capital and sustainability over a minimum period of three years. They will be aligned with the group’s strategic plan and main priorities towards its stakeholders. They can be measured for the entire group or by country or business, when appropriate, and subsequently compared to a group of peers.
The portion paid in shares cannot be sold until one year has elapsed since delivery. For share options, the retention period applied will be in accordance with the rules of the plan approved by the board of directors.
D) Other terms of the incentive No changes to the continuity, malus and clawback clauses of the remuneration policy for 2022 described in section E are expected. Furthermore, no changes are planned in respect of the clauses on hedging shares or the deferred amounts in cash adjusted for inflation.
iii) Shareholdings The policy on shareholdings approved in 2016, with the amendment introduced in 2020 relating to not selling the shares they receive as variable remuneration for a period of three years detailed in section 6.3.E above will apply in 2023 and 2024, unless the remuneration committee proposes it be amended to the board in light of exceptional circumstances (regulations, orders or recommendations from regulators or supervisors). Such amendments would be described in detail in the report on the remuneration committee and the annual report on director’s remuneration put to a non-binding vote at the annual general meeting.
iv) Principle of equal pay The same principle of equal pay that applies for executive directors and any other Santander employee described in respect of 2022 applies for 2023 and 2024.
Terms and conditions of executive directors’ contracts Executive directors’ terms of service are governed by board-approved contracts they sign with Banco Santander. The basic terms and conditions, besides those relating to the remuneration mentioned above, are the ones described herebelow.
A. Exclusivity and non-competition Executive directors may not contract with other companies or entities to perform services, unless expressly authorised by the board of directors. In all cases, they are bound by a duty of non-competition in relation to companies and activities similar in nature to Banco Santander and its consolidated group.
In addition, executive director contracts impose prohibitions on competing and attracting customers, employees and suppliers, which can be enforced for two years after their termination in their executive duties for reasons other than a breach by Banco Santander. In regard to Ana Botín and José Antonio Álvarez, the compensation to be paid by Banco Santander for this duty of non-competition is twice the amount of the fixed remuneration.
B. Code of Conduct Executive directors are obliged to adhere strictly to the group’s General Code and the Code of Conduct in Securities Markets, especially in terms of confidentiality, professional ethics and conflicts of interest.
C. Termination The length of executive directors' contract is indefinite. Contracts do not provide for any severance payment upon termination apart from what the law provides.
If Ana Botín’s contract is terminated by Banco Santander, she must remain available to the group for four months in order to ensure proper transition (6 months from the moment pre-retirement.

Responsible Corporate Economic and Risk management Contents banking governance financial review and compliance provisions are taken out). During this period, she would continue to receive her gross annual salary.
D. Pre-retirement and benefit plans The board of directors has approved in 2020, an amendment to the contracts of the executive directors whereby: • Ana Botín ceases to have the right to pre-retire if she leaves Banco Santander out of her own volition, keeping this right in case of termination by Banco Santander until 31 August 2022. After this date, she does not have the right to pre-retire. While she keeps this right she will be entitled to an annual allotment equal to the sum of her fixed remuneration and 30% of the average amount of her last variable remuneration, to a maximum of three. This allotment is subject to the malus and clawback provisions in place for a period of five years.
• José Antonio Álvarez ceases to have the right to pre-retire in case of termination of his contract.
They both participate in the defined contribution scheme created in 2012, which covers the contingencies of retirement, disability and death. Banco Santander makes annual contributions to executive directors’ benefit plans schemes. Annual contributions are calculated in proportion to executive directors’ pensionable bases, and the group will continue to make them until the executive directors’ leave the group or until their early retirement within the group, their death or disability (including during pre-retirement). The pensionable base of executive directors’ annual contributions is their fixed remuneration plus 30% of the average of their last three variable remuneration amounts. Contributions will be 22% of pensionable bases.
The pension amount that corresponds to contributions linked to variable remuneration will be invested in Santander shares for five years from the earlier of the date of retirement or cessation. It will be paid in cash after the five years have elapsed or on the retirement date (if later). Moreover, the malus and clawback clauses for variable remuneration contributions will apply for the same period as the related bonus or incentive.
This benefit plan is outsourced to Santander Seguros y Reaseguros, Compañía Aseguradora, S.A. Executive directors’ economic rights under the scheme belong to them even if they are not active in the group at the time of their retirement, death or disability. Their contracts do not provide for any severance pay upon termination apart from what the law provides and in the case of pre-retirement, the aforementioned annual allotment.
E. Insurance and other remuneration and benefits in kind Ana Botín and José Antonio Álvarez will receive the supplement to their fixed remuneration approved when the supplementary life and health benefits were eliminated in 2018. It will be paid in 2022, 2023 and 2024 in the same amount and continue to be paid until they reach retirement age (even if they are still active).
The group has life and health insurance policies taken out for directors. Insurance premiums for 2022 include standard life insurance and the life insurance cover with the supplement to their fixed remuneration mentioned above. In 2023 and 2024, premiums could vary if directors’ fixed pay or actuarial circumstances change.
Furthermore, executive directors are covered by Banco Santander’s civil liability insurance policy and may receive other benefits in kind (such as employee loans) pursuant to the group’s general policy and subject to the corresponding tax treatment. Likewise, the Bank makes available to directors the human and material means required or considered appropriate for carrying out their duties (including any travel required for the exercise of their role). Any eventual private use of these means by the executive directors is duly paid by them under the terms and conditions approved by the board of directors upon proposal from the remuneration committee.
F. Confidentiality and return of documents Directors are bound to a strict duty of confidentiality during their relationship and subsequent to termination. Executive directors are required to return any documents and items relating to their activities and in their possession to Banco Santander.
Agreements with non-executive members of the board Sergio Rial signed an agreement (effective on 1 January 2022) as strategic adviser to Grupo Santander for providing specific advisory services on strategic and digital transformation, including also business development in the Asian markets and other strategic matters. He will receive fixed remuneration of EUR 2.1 million and variable pay of EUR 1 million, subject to the achievement of objectives. The agreement is for an indefinite term. It also includes a one year non-compete commitment which would entitle him to receive EUR 2 million if he complies with this commitment.
Luis Isasi has a contract since 4 April 2020 to act as non-executive chair of the board of Santander España (for which he receives EUR 925,000 a year) and to serve as a member of the board of Santander España (for which he receives EUR 75,000 a year). His contract is permanent and does not entitle him to any compensation if terminated.
Appointment of new executive directors The components of remuneration and basic structure of the agreements described in this remunerations policy will apply to any new director that is given executive functions at Banco Santander, notwithstanding the possibility of amending specific terms of agreements so that, overall, they contain conditions similar to those previously described.
Directors’ total remuneration for executive duties cannot exceed the highest remuneration received by the group’s current executive directors under the remuneration policy approved by shareholders. The same rules apply if a director assumes new duties or becomes an executive director.
If a director takes up executive functions in a specific division or local unit, the board of directors, on the remuneration committee's recommendation, can adapt the metrics for setting and paying incentives to take that division or local unit into account in addition to the group.
Remuneration paid to directors in that capacity will be included within the maximum amount set by shareholders to be distributed by the board of directors in the terms described above.
A new director coming from an entity outside Santander Group could be paid a buyout to offset any variable remuneration foregone for having accepted a contract with the group; and/or a sign-on bonus for leaving to join Banco Santander.
This compensation could be paid fully or partly in shares and share options, depending on the delivery limits approved at the annual general shareholders' meeting. Authorization is expected to be sought at the next general shareholders’ meeting in order to deliver a.

Furthermore, sign-on bonuses can only be paid once to new executive directors, in cash or in shares, and in each case they will not exceed the sum of the maximum variable remuneration awarded for all executive directors.
In 2021, no executive director appointments could trigger buy outs, sign-on bonuses or any other form of remuneration.
Temporary exceptions to the remuneration policy According to section 6 of Article 529 novedecies of the Spanish Companies Act, specific exceptions may apply to components in the remuneration policy, based on particular business needs or macroeconomic context in the Group's geographies , provided that they are required to serve the long-term interests and sustainability of the entity; ensure its viability; and require to be adopted urgently.
Such exceptions include: • Complex macroeconomic scenarios where the ordinary course of the business is severely impacted.
• The appointment of a new executive chair or chief executive officer, or the need to retain an executive director to avoid a vacancy at the head of the Group (vacatio regis) during especially complex times for the business.
• The need to adapt to regulatory change.
To apply, exceptions must be supported by: • a reasoned remuneration committee proposal; and • board of directors analysis and approval.
Any applied exception will be explained in the Annual report on directors' remuneration.
6.5 Preparatory work and decision-making for the remuneration policy; remuneration committee involvement. 
Section 4.7 'Remuneration committee activities for 2021', (the report on the remuneration committee) states: • Pursuant to Banco Santander’s bylaws and the Rules and regulations of the board of directors, the duties relating to the remuneration of directors performed by the remuneration committee.
• How the remuneration committee is composed on the date the report is approved.
• The number of meetings it had in 2021, including joint sessions with the risk, compliance and regulation supervision committee.
• The date of the meeting in which the report was approved.
• The 2020 annual report on directors’ remuneration was approved by the board of directors and put to a binding vote at the 2021 AGM, with 91.6% of the votes in favour. The tally of the votes was:

Decision process for the development, review and application of the policy Pursuant to Article 529 novodecies of the Spanish Companies Act, the remuneration committee issues the report on the proposed remuneration policy for 2022, 2023 and 2024 herein. The board of directors then submits it to the 2022 AGM as a separate item on the agenda and an integral part of this text. See section 6.4 'Directors' remuneration policy for 2022, 2023 and 2024 submitted to a binding shareholder vote'.
Banco Santander’s Compensation function prepares the remuneration policy with the suggestions, requests and comments received during the year from the human resources committee, remuneration committee and the board of directors. A first draft of the policy is submitted to the remuneration committee for review every January. The review considers the suggestions, requests and comments the chair and lead director receive through shareholder and stakeholder engagement during the year on our corporate governance and our remuneration structures. Regulators’ recommendations and legal requirements that may have come to light since the last time the director remuneration policy was submitted for approval by the annual general meeting are also considered.
The committee also makes sure the policy is consistent with the Group's culture and our Simple, Personal and Fair values. The Compensation function then prepares the final draft for the remuneration committee to submit to the board of directors for approval in February.
Based on the analysis carried out in the context of the 2021 annual remuneration report elaboration and its continued supervision of the remuneration policy, the remuneration committee believes the director remuneration policy for 2022, 2023 and 2024 which is included in section 6.4 above is consistent with the principles of Banco Santander’s remuneration policy and its remuneration scheme set out in the Bylaws.
As detailed herein, the policy considers (i) further simplifying our executive remuneration scheme by reducing the four metrics relating to annual results to three (i.e. customers, RoRWA and RoTE) and combining more simplicity with our key strategic pillars of customers and profitability, without losing sight of proper risk and capital management, which is also added as qualitative element for the result,; (ii) introducing share options as part of variable pay, with the aim of creating a greater alignment with shareholder returns; and (iii) updating the metrics linked to the achievement of multi-year objectives, maintaining total shareholder return (TSR) and introducing RoTE and ESG-related metrics related to our Responsible banking commitments, in order to adhere to best market practice and our stakeholders’ preferences, prioritizing long-term profitability for.

In 2021, no deviations from, or temporary exceptions to, the application of the remuneration policy occurred.
6.6 Remuneration of non-director members of senior management 2021 variable remuneration was approved by the board of directors on 1 February 2022 in view of the recommendation the remuneration committee of 31 January 2022. It was set according to Banco Santander’s general remuneration policy as well as specific details pertaining to senior management.
In general, senior management variable remuneration packages were calculated with the quantitative metrics and qualitative assessment used for executive directors (see section 6.3 B ii).
Some senior managers’ contracts were amended in 2018 in the same manner described under 6.3.C and D in respect of Ana Botín and José Antonio Alvarez, with a pension scheme of 22% of their pensionable bases, the elimination of supplementary benefits, an increase of the insured sum of life insurance and a supplement to fixed remuneration in cash which is included under "Other remuneration".
The following table shows the amounts of short term remuneration (immediately payable) and deferred remuneration (not linked to multi year targets) for senior management as of 31 December 2021 and 2020, excluding those of executive directors. This amount has been reduced by 33% compared to that reported in 2014 (EUR 80,792 thousand):

In 2020, this corresponds to the estimated fair value of maximum annual payments for 2024, 2025 and 2026 in the fifth cycle of the plan for deferred variable pay linked to multi-year targets. Fair value in the plan was determined on the authorization date based on the valuation report of independent expert Willis Towers Watson. Based on the plan for 2021 and success levels of similar plans at peer entities, the expert found a range of 60%-80% reasonable to estimate the initial success ratio. Therefore, fair value was considered to be 70% of the maximum value. B. The number of shares in Santander as deferred variable pay subject to long-term metrics shown in the table above was 1,234 thousand in 2021 (965 thousand shares in Santander in 2020).
The long-term goals are the same as those for executive directors. They are described in section 6.3 B iv).
Senior executives who stepped down from their roles in 2021 consolidated salary remuneration and other remuneration until the cessation of their duties for a total amount of EUR 5,294 thousand during the year (EUR 5,984 thousand for those who stepped down from their roles in 2020). They also have the right to receive, in total, 55 thousand euros in variable pay subject to long-term targets (EUR 133 thousand for those who stepped down from their roles in 2020).
At our 2021 AGM, shareholders approved the 2021 Digital Transformation Incentive, a variable remuneration scheme that delivers Santander shares and share options if the group hits major milestones on its digital roadmap, and is aimed at a group of up to 250 employees whose functions are deemed essential to Santander’s growth. No senior executives are included within this plan in 2021.
The 2020 Digital Transformation Incentive, which terms are substantially the same as those of the 2021 one, included three senior executives, who may receive a total of EUR 1,700 thousand.
See Note 46 to the 2021 Group's consolidated financial statements for further information on the Digital Transformation Incentive.
In 2021, the ratio of variable to fixed pay components was 125% of the total for senior managers, well within the maximum limit of 200% set by shareholders.

Responsible Corporate Economic and Risk management Contents banking governance financial review and compliance 6.7 Prudentially significant disclosures document. 
On the remuneration committee’s recommendation, the board approves the key remuneration elements of managers or employees who, while not belonging to senior management, take on risks, carry out control functions (i.e. internal audit, risk management and compliance) or who receive global remuneration that places them in the same remuneration bracket as senior management and employees who take on risk. These are typically those whose professional activities may have an important impact on the Group's risk profile (all of these, together with the senior management and Banco Santander's board of directors form the so called 'Identified Staff' or 'Material Risk Takers')
Every year, the remuneration committee reviews and, if applicable, updates identified staff in order to include individuals within the organization who qualify as such. The Remuneration Policies chapter in the 2021 Pillar III disclosures report 28 of Banco Santander, S.A. explains the criteria and regulations followed to identify such staff.
At the end of 2021, 1,018 group executives (including executive directors and non-director senior managers) were considered identified staff (1,394 in 2020), which accounts for 0.52% of the total final workforce (0.73% in 2020).
Identified staff have the same remuneration standards as executive directors (see sections 6.1 and 6.3), but not: • Category-based deferral percentages and terms.
• The possibility in 2021 of certain manager categories of only having deferred variable pay subject to malus and clawback clauses (and not to long-term targets).
• The portion of variable remuneration paid or deferred as shares for group executives in Brazil, Chile and Poland that can be delivered in shares or similar instruments of their own listed entities (as in previous years).
In 2022, on top of the inclusion of share options, described in section 6.4 above, the board will maintain its flexibility to determine full or partial payment in shares or similar instruments of Banco Santander and its subsidiaries in the proportion it deems appropriate (according to the maximum number of Santander shares allocated at the general meeting and to any regulatory restrictions in each jurisdiction), in addition to the aforementioned introduction of share options in the executive pay of Banco Santander, S.A.
The aggregate amount of variable remuneration for identified staff in 2021, the amounts deferred in cash and shares, and the ratio of the variable to fixed remuneration components are explained in the remuneration policies chapter of Banco Santander’s Pillar III disclosures report for 2021.

Responsible Corporate Economic and Risk management Contents banking governance financial review and compliance 7. Group structure and internal governance. 
Grupo Santander is structured into legally independent subsidiaries whose parent company is Banco Santander, S.A. Its registered office is in Santander (Cantabria, Spain), while its corporate centre is located in Boadilla del Monte (Madrid, Spain). It has a GroupSubsidiary Governance Model (GSGM) and good governance practices in place for its core subsidiaries. Any references to subsidiaries in this section are to the group’s most prominent entities.
The key features of the GSGM are: • The subsidiaries’ governing bodies must ensure their rigorous and prudent management and economic solvency while pursuing the interests of their shareholders and other stakeholders.
• The subsidiaries are managed locally by teams that possess extensive knowledge on, and experience with, their customers and markets, while benefiting from the synergies and advantages of belonging to the Group.
• The subsidiaries are subject to local authority regulation and supervision, although the ECB supervises the Group overall.
• Customer funds are secured by the deposit guarantee schemes in the subsidiaries’ countries and are subject to local laws.
The subsidiaries finance their own capital and liquidity. The group’s capital and liquidity are coordinated by corporate committees. Intragroup risk transactions are limited, transparent and carried out under market conditions. Grupo Santander retains a controlling interest in subsidiaries listed in certain countries.
Each subsidiary runs independently and has its own recovery plan, limiting the contagion of risk between them and reducing systemic risk.
7.1 Corporate Centre. 
Banco Santander’s GSGM is supported by a corporate centre, which brings control and support units together with functions such as strategy, risk, compliance, auditing, finance, accounting, technology and operations, human resources, legal services, internal governance, communications and marketing. It adds value to the Group by: • Enhancing governance under robust corporate frameworks, models, policies and procedures to implement strategies and ensure effective Group oversight.
• Making the group’s units more efficient through cost management synergies, economies of scale and a common brand.
• Sharing best practices in global connectivity, commercial initiatives and digitalization.
7.2 Internal governance. 
Grupo Santander’s internal governance model outlines a set of principles that regulate three types of relationships with its subsidiaries: • The subsidiaries’ governing bodies are subject to the group’s rules and procedures for structuring, forming and running boards of directors and audit, nomination, remuneration and risk committees, according to international standards and good governance practices. This includes embedding other group rules and regulations on the suitability, appointment, remuneration and succession plans of governing body members, which fully comply with local regulations and supervisory standards.
• The relationship between regional and country heads and the group CEO.
• The relationship between local and global heads of key control positions, following a three lines of defence model: chief officers for risk (CRO), compliance (CCO), audit (CAE), finance (CFO) and accounting (CAO), as well as other key support and business functions (Technology and Operations, HR, General Counsel, Legal Services, Marketing, Communications, Strategy, SCIB, and Wealth Management & Insurance).
The group has three regional heads who report to the group CEO and are responsible for consolidating and streamlining the management and coordination of its core countries in the three geographic areas where it operates: Europe, South America and North America. Their key responsibilities must be undertaken in compliance with European Union and country-specific laws and regulations, ensuring that the country heads' role and accountability (including regulatory responsibilities) are not compromised.
Since 2020, the Europe region (Spain, Portugal, Poland and UK) has the mandate to execute a pan-European operating model to deliver benefits of scale and efficiency that leverage common product and regional management structures in the countries. Specific coordination elements and organizational structures were defined to ensure the effective discharge of the Europe regional head's responsibilities, fully respecting local governance. Business and functional roles were also created to support and control those responsibilities.

Responsible Corporate Economic and Risk management Contents banking governance financial review and compliance. 
The GSGM dictates rules for appointing those officers, setting their objectives (weighted 50% local and 50% group/regional) and variable pay, assessing their performance and planning their succession. It also explains how group officers should coordinate and interact with their subsidiary counterparts.
Grupo Santander has corporate frameworks for matters considered to have a material impact on its risk profile, covering risk, capital, liquidity, compliance, financial crime, technology, auditing, accounting, finance, strategy, human resources, outsourcing, cybersecurity, special situations management, and communications and brand. In 2021 a new Responsible Banking Corporate Framework was approved by the board. They also specify: • How the Group should supervise and exert control over subsidiaries; and • The group’s involvement in subsidiaries’ decision-making (and vice versa).
Banco Santander board of directors approves the GSGM and corporate frameworks for the subsidiary governing bodies to formally adhere to them. They take local requirements for subsidiaries into account, and are revised each year as required by the group’s board and adapted to new legislation and international best practices.
The functions draw on corporate frameworks to prepare internal regulatory documents that are given to subsidiaries as a reference for implementing those frameworks effectively, cohesively and in compliance with local laws and supervisory requirements. This approach ensures consistency throughout the Group. Every year an assessment is conducted by the Functions on the effective embedding of the contents of the group's internal regulation at local level. This information is presented by the internal governance office to the board of directors.
The group’s internal governance office and subsidiary general counsels are responsible for embedding the governance model and corporate frameworks. Every year, the group assesses their performance in reports sent to governing bodies.
Since 2019, a policy for the governance of non-GSGM subsidiaries , completes and enhances the governance and control system that has been applied to those companies thus far.
Since 2020, PagoNxt, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Banco Santander that is structured as a dedicated holding company with a set of key initiatives on digitalizing the group's financial services, with payments at the core has its own governance model. This model defines an organizational and governance framework for PagoNxt and its subsidiaries in the context of the group-wide arrangements. It specifically covers the scope, principles, roles and responsibilities, key processes and governance bodies that should be in place to ensure that PagoNxt is managed in alignment with group, legal and supervisory expectations.
Also since 2020, Santander Corporate and Investment Banking (SCIB) and Wealth Management and Insurance have specific governance models to ensure robust, group-wide oversight of those businesses, as set out in the GSGM.
The following charts show the three levels of the GSGM, as well as the main actions to ensure an effective relationship and solid internal governance system for the Group.

Responsible Corporate Economic and Risk management Contents banking governance financial review and compliance 8. Internal control over financial reporting (ICFR)
This section describes the key aspects of Grupo Santander's ICFR in respect of financial reporting, including: • Control activities and control environment.
• Risk assessment in financial reporting.
• Reporting and communication.
• System monitoring.
• The external auditor’s report.
8.1 Control environment. 
Governance and control bodies The board of directors approves the financial reports Banco Santander must publicly disclose as a listed company. It is the body that oversees and guarantees the integrity of the Group’s systems for internal communication, operational and financial control, accounting, financial reporting and legal compliance.
The board of directors has an audit committee that assists with supervising the group’s financial reporting and internal control systems (see section 4.5 'Audit committee activities in 2021').
The audit committee works with the external auditor to address every aspect with impact in the ICFR identified in audits. It also makes sure the external auditor issues a report on the group’s system for ICFR.
Responsibilities, General Code of Conduct, whistleblowing channel and training Responsibility functions Grupo Santander, through its corporate organization functions, in countries and businesses, defines, implements and maintains the unit's organizational structures, catalogue of roles and size. The corporate organization function defines and documents the corporate model for managing structures and templates which is used as a reference across the group.
The organizational units are in charge of identifying and defining the main functions under the responsibility of each structural unit, ensuring that the organization has a solid ICFRS model.
Grupo Santander has a responsibility scheme to identify potential risks and their mitigating controls under a three-pronged defence model that establishes lines of authority and accountability including:
The head of the financial accounting and control function (the CAO), which has the following functions concerning the generation of financial information, amongst others: • Integrating the group's corporate accounting policies into its management and adapting them to local needs.
• Ensuring that appropriate organizational structures are in place to carry out the tasks assigned, as well as suitable hierarchicalfunctional structure.
• Running critical procedures (control models), based on corporate technology.
• Implementing the corporate accounting and management information systems and adapting them to the specific needs of each unit.
In order to preserve its independence, each controller reports hierarchically to the head of the entity or country in which it exercises its responsibilities (country head) and functionally to the head of the group's Financial Accounting and Control division.
The non-financial risk control function is responsible for: • Establishing and circulating the methodology for documenting the group's Internal Risk Control System (IRCS) and IRCS evaluation and certification, which covers the ICFRS, amongst other regulatory and regulatory requirements. Grupo Santander's IRCS means the process carried out by the board of directors, senior managers and other group staff to provide reasonable assurance that their objectives will be achieved.
• Encouraging documentation maintenance to adapt it to organizational and regulatory changes and, along with the Financial Accounting and Control division, and, where applicable, representatives of the divisions and/or companies involved, to present the IRCS evaluation outcome to the audit committee. Similar functions in each unit that reports to the corporate nonfinancial risk control area.
General Code of Conduct (GCC) The group’s GCC sets out the guidelines, principles and rules approved by the board of directors to govern Grupo Santander employees’ conduct and ethics. Furthermore, it dictates guidelines in relation to accounting standards and financial reporting. The GCC can be viewed on our corporate website.
All of the group’s employees, including members of its governance bodies, sign the Code of Conduct, even though some are also bound to the Code of Conduct in Securities Markets and other codes of. 
Annual report 2021 276


 

 

 

 

 

 
Responsible Corporate Economic and Risk management Contents banking governance financial review and compliance conduct specific to the area or business in which they work. Employees have access to e-learning courses on the Code and can consult the compliance and conduct function to address any queries about its application.
The GCC is a fundamental resource of the compliance function. It explains the duties of the group’s governance bodies, units and areas required to implement it together with the compliance function.
If anyone violates the code, the human resources function adopts disciplinary measures and recommends corrective action (including work sanctions), irrespective of any related administrative or criminal sanctions.
The board of directors adapted the GCC in 2021 to forbid board members and employees from releasing external communications on Banco Santander's behalf or from acting as its representatives and employees if such communications could undermine the Group's neutrality by showing political or ideological bias. See the on the information on 'General Code of Conduct' section 'Conduct and ethical behaviour' in the 'Responsible banking' chapter.
Whistleblowing channel Banco Santander’s whistleblowing channel is called Canal Abierto. It is a confidential and anonymous means for employees to report unlawful acts, violations of the GCC and other behaviour contrary to corporate values. The channel enable communications by other people related to Banco Santander other than employees, such as shareholders, customers, suppliers and other third parties, ensuring that they are treated confidentially and anonymously.
It can also be used to report claims of accounting or auditing irregularities under SOX to the compliance and conduct function, which will elevate them to the audit committee for appropriate measures to be taken.
The channel does not require whistleblowers to give personal information in order to keep reports confidential before they the audit committee can review them. Only certain compliance and conduct function officers analyse reports to determine if matters pertain to accounting or auditing in order to submit them to the audit committee.
Canal Abierto is supervised jointly by the audit committee and the risk supervision, regulation and compliance committee depending on the subject of the complaint. The SOX attributes the authority to supervise the whistleblowing channel in matters that fall under the remit of the audit committee (specifically financial and accounting, including those related to the audit), while the supervision of reports of breaches of regulatory requirements for corporate behaviours or the internal governance system are the responsibility of the risk, regulation and compliance committee. The channel can be viewed on our corporate website.
For more information on the number of complaints filed on the channel and their typology, see the on the information on 'Ethical Channels' section 'A talented and motivated team' in the 'Responsible banking' chapter, for additional information.
Training Group employees who help prepare or analyse financial information take part in training programmes and regular refresher courses specifically designed to teach them the concepts and skills they require to discharge their duties properly.
The Financial Accounting and Control division promotes, designs and oversees these programmes and courses. It has with support from the corporate learning and career development unit under the Human Resources division.
Training takes the form of both e-learning and on-site sessions monitored and overseen by the corporate learning and career development unit to guarantee that employees duly complete them and assimilate concepts properly.
Training programmes and refresher courses taught in 2020 focused on matters directly and indirectly related to the financial reporting. These subjects include: (i) risk analysis and management; (ii) accounting and financial statement analysis; (iii) the business, banking and the financial environment; (iv) financial management, costs and budgeting; (v) numerical skills; and (vi) calculations and statistics.
31,373 employees in the all of the group’s markets were involved in training programmes. Over 545,459 training hours were spent at the corporate centre in Spain and remotely via e-learning. Furthermore, local units develop their own training programmes based on the parent’s.
8.2 Risk assessment in financial reporting. 
The Group has a specific process to identify the companies that must be included in its scope of consolidation. The Financial Accounting and Control division and the General Secretariat division oversee this approach.
This process enables us to identify the entities the Grupo Santander controls through the voting rights that grant direct or indirect ownership of its capital and other entities controlled by others such as mutual funds, securitization funds and structured entities; analyses whether the group has control over an entity, whether it has rights to the variable returns of the entity or is exposed to them, and whether it can influence the amount of such variable returns. If the group is considered to have control, the entity is included in the scope of consolidation and is consolidated using the global integration method.
Otherwise, we analyse whether there is significant influence or joint control. If so, the entity is also included in the scope of consolidation and it is measured using the equity method.
For entities with the greatest impact on the preparation of the group's financial information, we implement an IRCS using a homogeneous methodology to make sure that relevant controls are included and all significant risks to financial reporting are covered.
The group's IRCS complies with the strictest international standards, particularly the guidelines of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) within its last published Internal Control framework in 2013 which covers control targets for the effective and efficient operations, reliable financial reporting and regulatory compliance.
The risk identification process takes into account all the group's activities, the scope of which is greater than all the risks directly related to the preparation of the group's financial information.
The identification of potential risks that must necessarily be covered by the IRCS is based on management's knowledge and understanding of the business and its operations relative to the. 
Annual report 2021 277


 

 

 

 


Responsible Corporate Economic and Risk management Contents banking governance financial review and compliance importance and qualitative criteria associated with the type, complexity or structure of the business.
Banco Santander ensures there are controls to cover risks of errors and fraud in financial reporting, such as (i) the existence of assets, liabilities and transactions at the relevant date; (ii) the items are assets or rights or liabilities and obligations of the group; (iii) timely and correct recording and adequate valuation of assets, liabilities and transactions; and (iv) correct application of accounting principles and rules, as well as appropriate breakdowns.
The main features of the group's IRCS are as follows: • It is a corporate model that involves the entire organizational structure through a direct set of individual responsibilities.
• Management of the IRCS documents is decentralized to the various units, while coordination and monitoring falls to the nonfinancial risk control area, which provides general criteria and guidelines to standardize procedure documents, control assessment, criteria for classifying potential deficiencies and regulatory adaptations.
• It is a global model primarily aimed at documenting activities to produce consolidated financial information and other procedures carried out by each entity's support areas that, without having a direct impact on the accounts, could lead to possible losses or contingencies in the event of incidents, errors, breaches of regulations and/or fraud.
• It is dynamic and constantly updated in order to reflect the reality of the group's business, risks and controls to mitigate them.
• It produces comprehensive documents on the processes within its scope and includes detailed descriptions of operations, assessment criteria and reviews.
All IRCS documents of the Group's companies are compiled on a corporate IT application that is used by employees of different levels of responsibility in the assessment and certification of the group's internal control system.
The audit committee is responsible for supervising Banco Santander and the group's regulated financial information procedures and the internal control systems.
8.3 Control activities. 
Revision and approval of financial information The audit committee and the board of directors oversee the preparation and submission of the financial information required of Banco Santander and the Group, which includes the non-financial information and its integrity. They also review compliance with regulatory requirements, the scope of consolidation and the correct application of accounting criteria, ensuring that this information is permanently updated on the Banco Santander corporate's website.
The production, revision and approval of financial information and the description of ICFR is documented in a corporate tool that integrates the control model into risk management, including a description of activities, risks, tasks and controls associated with all operations that may have a significant effect on the financial statements. This documentation covers recurrent banking operations and one-off transactions (sale of investments, fixed assets transactions, etc.) and aspects related to judgements and estimates, to correctly record, evaluate, present and breakdown financial information.
The audit committee is responsible for reporting to the board on the financial information that the group must regularly publish, ensuring that it is prepared in accordance with the same principles and practices as the annual accounts and is as equally reliable as the financial statements for the board to adopt the corresponding resolutions.
The most significant aspects when closing and reviewing relevant judgements, estimates, measurements and projections are: • Impairment losses on certain assets.
• The assumptions used in the actuarial calculation of postemployment benefit liabilities and other obligations.
• The useful life of tangible and intangible fixed assets.
• The valuation of consolidation goodwill.
• The calculation of provisions and of contingent liabilities.
• The fair value of certain unquoted assets and liabilities.
• The recoverability of the tax assets.
• The fair value of acquired identifiable assets and the liabilities assumed in business combinations.
The group CAO presents the financial information to the audit committee for validation at least quarterly, giving explanations of the main criteria used to make estimates, assessments and significant judgements.
The information provided to directors prior to meetings, including relevant judgements, estimates and projections is specifically prepared for these sessions.
The group also has a corporate accounting and financial management information committee, which is responsible for governing and supervising accounting, financial management and control, and ensuring that these matters are disclosed in accordance with law and such disclosure is fair, accurate and not misleading.
To verify that the IRCS operates correctly, the group conducts an annual pyramid assessment and certification, identifying and analysing the criticality of risks and the effectiveness of controls. This begins with an assessment of control activities by those responsible for them, which is then challenged and ratified through the organization's different hierarchy, so that, the CEO, the CFO and the CAO can certify the effectiveness of the IRCS.
The Non-Financial Risk Control area prepares a report that includes the main conclusions from the units' certifications reflecting the main deficiencies identified during the year and indicating whether they have been appropriately resolved or what plans are in place for satisfactory resolution as well as supporting evidence for the signatures of the CEO, CFO and CAO.
The Non-Financial Risk Control area presents the conclusions of these assessments to the audit committee alongside with the Financial Accounting and Control division and, where applicable, the representatives of the divisions and/or companies in question, prior to submission to the risk supervision, regulation and compliance committee.

Responsible Corporate Economic and Risk management Contents banking governance financial review and compliance. 
The Group also has a forum to oversee internal control. It is chaired by the heads of the Risk and Financial Accounting & Control divisions and continuously monitors the Group's control environment and ICFR strategy and operations.
Internal control policies and procedures for IT systems The Technology and Operations division draws up the group’s corporate policies on IT systems involved directly or indirectly with the financial statements. These systems implement special internal controls to prepare and post financial information correctly.
The internal control policies on the following aspects are of particular importance: • Updated and divulged internal policies and procedures for system security and access to applications and computer systems according to functions and ratings of each unit/role.
• The group's methodology, under which new applications are developed and existing applications are maintained or adapted through a circuit that formulates, develops and tests them so as to treat financial information reliably.
• Once applications are developed according to regularly defined requirements (detailed documentation of processes to be implemented), they are run through comprehensive tests by a specialist development laboratory.
• Before they are rolled out, a complete software testing cycle is run in a pre-production computerized environment that simulates real situations. Testing includes technical and functional tests, performance tests, user-acceptance tests and pilot and prototype tests, which are defined by the entities.
• The group’s continuity plans for key functions in disasters or other events that could suspend or disrupt operations, as well as highly automated back-up systems that support critical systems and require little manual intervention owing to redundant systems, high availability systems and redundant communication lines.
Internal control policies and procedures for outsourced activities and valuation services from independent experts The group’s action framework and specific policies and procedures fittingly cover outsourcing risks. All group companies must adhere to this framework, which meets the EBA's requirements for outsourcing and risk management with third parties. It consists of: • Tasks to initiate, record, process, settle, report and accounting for transactions and asset valuations.
• IT support in terms of software development, infrastructure maintenance, incident management, security and processing.
• Other material support services not directly related to financial reporting, such as supplier management, property management, HR management, etc.
Key control procedures include: • Documenting relations between group companies with comprehensive service agreements.
• Documentation and validation by the group’s service providers of processes and controls for the services they perform.
• The external suppliers must undergo an approval process to ensure that the relevant risks associated with the services they provide remain within acceptable levels, in accordance with the group's risk appetite.
The group reviews estimates internally according to its control model guidelines. It will hire the services of a third party to help with specific matters upon confirming their expertise and independence and approving their methods and rationale of its assumptions though relevant procedures.
Furthermore, the group’s controls make sure information for external suppliers of services that could affect the financial statements is accurately and comprehensively detailed in service level agreements.
8.4 Information and communication. 
Responsible for accounting policies The Financial Accounting and Control division has an area called 'accounting policies', whose manager reports directly to the head of the division, and has the following exclusive responsibilities: • To define the accounting treatment of the transactions that constitute Banco Santander's activity, in accordance with their economic nature and the regulations governing the financial system.
• To define and keep up-to-date the group's accounting policies and resolve any doubts or conflicts arising from their interpretation.
• Improve and standardize the group's accounting practices.
The corporate accounting and financial reporting and management framework sets out the principles and guidelines to prepare accounting, financial and management information that must apply to all Grupo Santander entities as a key element of their good governance. The group's structure makes it necessary to establish these principles and standard guidelines for their application, and for each of the group entities to have effective consolidation methods and employ homogeneous accounting policies. The framework's principles described in this framework are adequately reflected in the group's accounting policies.
Accounting policies should be understood as a complement to local financial and accounting rules. Their overarching aims are (i) that statements and financial information made available to the management bodies, supervisors or other third parties, provide accurate and reliable information for decision-making in relation to the group, and (ii) timely compliance by all group entities with their legal obligations.
Accounting policies are revised at least once a year and when relevant regulations are amended.
Every month, the Accounting Policies area publishes an internal bulletin on new accounting regulation and their most significant interpretations.
The Group entities, through their operations or accounting heads, maintain open communication with the financial regulation and accounting processes area, as well as with the other areas of the Financial Accounting and Control division.

Responsible Corporate Economic and Risk management Contents banking governance financial review and compliance 8.5 Monitoring 2021 ICFR monitoring activities and results The board of directors approved an Internal Audit framework for Grupo Santander that defines the function and how it should conduct its work.
Internal Audit is a permanent, independent function that guarantees the quality and effectiveness of internal control, risk management (current or emerging) and governance processes and systems, thus contributing to the protection of the organization's value, solvency and reputation as well as the board of directors and senior managers. The internal audit function reports to the audit committee and periodically, at least twice a year, to the board of directors. As an independent unit, it also has direct access to the board when required.
Internal audit assesses: • The efficiency and effectiveness of the processes and systems referred to above.
• The compliance with applicable regulations and supervisory requirements.
• The reliability and integrity of financial and operational information.
• Asset integrity.
• Internal audit is the third line of defence, independent of the other two. Its scope of action includes: • All entities over which the group exercises effective control.
• Separated assets (for example, mutual funds) managed by the entities mentioned in the previous section.
• Any entity (or separated assets) not included in the above points, with which the group has entered into an agreement to provide Internal Audit functions.
This subjective scope includes, in any case, the activities, businesses and processes carried out (either directly or through outsourcing), the organization and, where applicable, commercial networks. Internal Audit may also conduct audits for other investees that are not included in the preceding points when the group has reserved this right as a shareholder, as well as on outsourced activities in accordance with the established agreements.
The audit committee supervises the group's internal audit function. See section 4.5 'Audit committee activities in 2021'.
As at 2021 year-end, Internal Audit had 1,212 employees, all exclusively dedicated to this service. Of these, 269 were based at Corporate Centre and 943 in the local units located in the main geographies where the group is present.
Every year, Internal Audit prepares an audit plan based on a risk selfassessment and is solely responsible for executing the plan. Reviews may lead to audit recommendations, which are prioritized in accordance with their relative importance, and are continuously monitored until fully implemented.
At its meeting of 19 February 2021, the audit committee reviewed the 2021 audit plan, which was reported to and approved by the board at its meeting of 22 February 2021.
Internal audit reports, as regards the review of the ICFR, mainly aimed to: • Verify compliance with the provisions contained in sections 302, 404, 406, 407 and 806 of the SOX Act.
• Check corporate governance with regard to information relating to the internal control system for financial reporting, including the risk culture.
• Review the functions performed by the internal control departments and by other departments, areas or divisions involved in ensuring compliance with the SOX Act.
• Make sure the supporting documentation relating to the SOX Act is up to date.
• Confirm the effectiveness of a sample of controls based on an internal audit risk assessment methodology.
• Assess the accuracy of the unit's certifications, especially their consistency of the certifications with respect to the observations and recommendations made by Internal Audit, the external auditors of the annual accounts or supervisors.
• Ratify the implementation of recommendations made in the audit plan.
In 2021, the audit committee and the board of directors were informed of the Internal Audit unit's work, in accordance with its annual plan, and of other matters related to this function. See section 4.5 'Audit committee activities in 2021'.
Detection and management of deficiencies The audit committee oversees to supervise the financial reporting process and the internal control systems. It is responsible for any control deficiencies that could affect the reliability and accuracy of the annual accounts. It may refer to the areas of the Group involved in the process to obtain the necessary information and clarifications. The committee also assesses the potential impact of any errors detected in the financial information.
The audit committee is responsible for discussing any significant weaknesses detected in the audit with the external auditor.
As part of its oversight, the audit committee assesses the results of the work of the internal audit unit, and may take the necessary measures to correct any deficiencies identified in the financial information.
In 2021, the audit committee was informed of the IRCS evaluation and certification for the 2019 financial year. See section 4.5 'Audit committee activities in 2021'.

Responsible Corporate Economic and Risk management Contents banking governance financial review and compliance 9. Other corporate governance information. 
Since 12 June 2018 CNMV allows the annual corporate governance and directors’ remuneration reports Spanish listed companies must submit to be drafted in a free format, which is what we selected for our corporate governance and directors’ remuneration reports since 2018.
The CNMV requires any issuer opting for a free format to provide certain information in a format it dictates so that it can be aggregated for statistical purposes. This information is included (i) for corporate governance matters, under section 9.2 'Statistical information on corporate governance required by the CNMV', which also covers the section 'Degree of compliance with corporate governance recommendations', and (ii) for remuneration matters, under section 9.5 'Statistical information on remuneration required by the CNMV'.
Some shareholders or other stakeholders may be used to the formats of the corporate governance and directors' remuneration reports set the by the CNMV. Therefore, each section under this format in sections 9.1 'Reconciliation with the CNMV’s corporate governance report model' and 9.4 'Reconciliation to the CNMV’s remuneration report model' include a cross reference indicating where this information may be found in the 2021 annual corporate governance report (drafted in a free format) and elsewhere in this annual report.
We have normally completed the 'comply or explain' section for all recommendations in the Spanish Corporate Governance Code to clearly show the ones we complied with, and explain the ones we partially complied or failed to comply with. In section 9.3 'Table on compliance with or explanations of recommendations in corporate governance', we have included a chart with cross-references showing where information supporting each response can be found in this corporate governance chapter and elsewhere in this annual report.

Responsible Corporate Economic and Risk management Contents banking governance financial review and compliance 1. Economic, regulatory and competitive context. 
In 2021, Santander operated in an environment marked by (i) fiscal and monetary policies implemented to counter the adverse effects of the covid-19 pandemic; (ii) the ongoing recovery from the pandemic, which has been inconsistent across countries and sectors; (iii) new covid-19 variants and significant outbreaks; and (iv) an upturn in inflation in the second half of the year, which reached a three-decade high in mature markets.
Inflationary pressures have intensified as a result of a number of factors, including the renewed demand for consumer goods; labour shortages; tensions in the supply chains of microchips and other key items; transportation issues; and increases in energy, certain raw materials and food prices.
Under these circumstances, withdrawal of the expansionary fiscal and monetary policies implemented in response to the covid-19 pandemic began, especially in the last quarter of 2021, particularly in countries that experienced the heaviest pressure on prices.
Economic performance by geography was as follows: • Eurozone (GDP: 5.2% estimated in 2021). GDP growth was driven by the lifting of lockdown measures and expansionary monetary and fiscal policies. The ECB kept interest rates stable despite the 5.1% rise in inflation in January 2022. However, at the monetary policy meeting held in February, the ECB showed more concern and was less positive regarding the outlook for inflation. In December 2021, the ECB had announced a reduction in its asset purchases starting in spring 2022.
• Spain (GDP: 5.0% in 2021). Economic recovery continued in 2021, a trend which is expected to return GCP to pre-pandemic levels in 2022. The labour market improved at a faster rate, with employment exceeding pre-pandemic levels. Inflation reached 6.7% in December, largely due to energy prices.
• United Kingdom (GDP: 7.5% in 2021). Strong economic growth offset the severe decline in 2020. Tensions in the labour market, particularly in some sectors, posed a greater risk for higher inflation (which exceeded 5% and is one of the main reasons behind the Bank of England's interest rate hike from 0.1% to 0.25% at the end of the year) to take hold.
• Portugal (GDP: 4.9% in 2021). Economic recovery continued. The labour market recovered quickly (unemployment at 6.5%) and inflation jumped to 2.7% in December. The socialist party won the country's parliamentary elections held in January 2022 with an absolute majority, providing stability for the next 4 years.
• Poland (GDP: 5.7% in 2021). The economy was remarkably buoyant despite a relatively moderate decline in 2020. Inflation ended the year at 8.6%, leading the central bank to raise the official interest rate to 2.25%.
• United States (GDP: 5.7% in 2021). Fiscal impulses and the reopening of the economy favoured a vigorous economic recovery which was somewhat dampened by supply-side problems from summer onwards. Supply chain and labour constraints pushed inflation to 7.0%. Unemployment falling to 3.9% in November drove the Federal Reserve (Fed) to start withdrawing monetary stimulus.
• Mexico (GDP: 4.8% preliminary in 2021). Strong GDP growth, partially reversing the decline in 2020. Inflation picked up considerably (7.4%). Banco de México raised its official benchmark from a low of 4.0% in the first half of 2021 to 5.5% at the end of the year.
• Brazil (GDP: 4.6% estimated in 2021). Outstanding economic recovery, especially since the drop in 2020 was lower than in the region as a whole. However, growth stalled as the year progressed due to the withdrawal of the 2020 fiscal stimulus and, in particular, to the inflation upturn (10.1% in December) and the consequent official interest rate hike, from 2% to 9.25% by the end of 2021, and an additional hike in January 2022 to 10.75%.
• Chile (GDP: 12.0% estimated in 2021). Sharp GDP growth stemmed from exceptional fiscal and monetary measures. Inflation rebounded to 7.2%. Banco Central de Chile raised the official interest rate from 0.5% to 4% by the end of 2021, with a further increase to 5.5% in January 2022.
• Argentina (GDP: 10.0% estimated in 2021). Strong recovery after recording one of the region's largest declines in 2020, driven by the reopening of service sector activities and fiscal stimulus. Inflation remained high at monthly rates of around 3%.

In mature markets, vaccination campaigns' favourable impact on the recovery of international travel acted as a support lever for equities, (especially in the US, where there was a strong fiscal impulse in addition to monetary stimulus). Spain, however, lagged behind other European countries and its stock market has not yet recovered precovid levels.
Inflationary pressures built up by rising commodity prices and by global supply chain bottlenecks due to a post-covid demand spike (especially for goods) pushed up bond yields in early 2021. Inflation is proving a more persistent problem than initially expected and central banks have started to withdraw monetary stimulus. Longterm debt yields remained subdued, as the withdrawal of stimulus is perceived as a risk to medium-term growth and there is still some uncertainty about the pandemic caused by new variants. German bund yields remained negative. The US dollar appreciated against the euro, boosted by the growth differential benefitting the US and expectations that the Fed will be ahead of the ECB in normalizing monetary policy.
Latin American countries' assets struggled amid heightened uncertainty stemming from rising inflation and tightening financial conditions, stimulus withdrawal in the US, the economic risk of new covid-19 variants, and some political tensions. Uncertainty was reflected in the fact that central bank interest rate hikes did not lead to currency appreciation in the countries.
The international banking environment is entering a phase of normalization and banks are gradually returning to their traditional business. In general, as support measures helped cushion the blow of the pandemic in the private sector, loan portfolios deteriorated less initially forecasted. This, together with economic recovery, is enabling banks to lower provisions, which improved profitability relative to 2020.
We estimate that this, together with stronger solvency in 2021, will leave the banking industry in a strong position to face a potential economic slowdown, based on the stress tests carried out by the main central banks.
Even so, global inflationary pressures and the consequent tightening of monetary policy in most economies pose management challenges for banks in the short term, particularly in developing markets with high indebtedness.
The challenges faced by the banking industry (considered more medium-term) have gained momentum in recent years and require institutions to act swiftly. The digital transformation accelerated during the pandemic, pushing entities to offer the best digital customer experience in the wake of a surge in new competitors.
The climate transition also requires a significant effort as institutions must develop new portfolio classification models to understand each entity's exposure to the transitional and physical risks that companies and households will face due to climate change in the coming years. This will be reflected in the first climate change stress exercises that the main central banks will conduct in 2022.
Regulatory environment As in 2020, sustainability and digitalization took centre stage in a regulatory landscape once again influenced by the covid-19 pandemic, with debates on key prudential topics, in view of the need to ensure banks' ability to help keep the economy afloat during times of crisis.
Prominent actions came in three areas: • Prudential: the European Commission published its proposal to implement the Basel III reform, which aims to reduce excessive variability of risk-weighted assets and favour comparability among banks.
• Sustainability: Europe continued to lead the way in talks on sustainability. Of note was the adoption of the Taxonomy Regulation that sets the criteria for classifying economic activities as environmentally sustainable. It also dictates the information that financial and non-financial companies will have to disclose about the environmental impact of their activities. Furthermore, the green asset ratio (GAR) is of utmost importance to the banking industry as it will show the percentage of exposures aligned with the EU Taxonomy.
• Digitalization: because covid-19 has sped up digitalization, the authorities are keen to regulate platforms and risks associated with new, private currencies that could enter into wide circulation (e.g. stablecoins). Central banks continue to explore the possibility of issuing digital currencies. A significant marker in the age of the digital economy is the deal struck by the OECD to ensure that all multinational enterprises pay tax wherever they earn profits, regardless of physical presence.

Responsible Corporate Economic and Risk management Contents banking governance financial review and compliance. 
Summary of Santander and public policy. 
Santander has always been highly supportive of robust, high-quality regulation that supports bank strength and solvency, underpins robust consumer protection and market stability standards, and creates transparency on risk and resilience for investors and supervisors. We are committed to engaging constructively and transparently with public policy makers and regulators on the aims, design and implementation of banking rules and policy frameworks that impact our banks' or our customers' interests. All our public policy engagements are oriented to providing decision-makers, mainly through official consultations, with valuable insights and data of the banking industry with transparency and integrity.
Capital and bank resilience. 
We believe that the reforms of the last decade have made financial institutions more robust in terms of capital. However, the covid-19 crisis which began in 2019 has raised some issues regarding the functioning of the regulatory framework that need to be carefully assessed. Additionally, the EU still has work to do to build the foundations of a true banking union. We continue to advocate for: 1
• An approach to continue working on the implementation of Basel III standards that does not materially increase new post-crisis capital requirements and takes into account the demands of digitalization, the green transformation and the post-covid recovery.
• Careful reflection on how aspects of the framework established after the 2009 crisis worked in the covid-19 context, for example, the capital buffers, as well as supervisory decisions taken during the crisis such as restrictions on dividend payouts.
• Banking regulation needs to recognize some of the realities of banks with a global footprint, such as the recognition of the Multiple Point of Entry resolution framework.
• A common deposit insurance scheme for EU banks that breaks the bank/sovereign loop.
Sustainability and sustainable finance. 
We believe that decarbonization is a first order social and environmental challenge in which banks have an important role to play and are fully committed to the objectives. We continue to advocate for: 2
• A fair transition; in which the costs and impacts of change are anticipated and addressed proactively.
• International coordination on key policy frameworks to the greatest extent possible, especially on green taxonomies, climate disclosures and climate-risk stress testing.
• Robust, credible and comparable ESG data availability as a key enabler to make informed decisions and particularly to direct financial flows towards net zero emissions economies.
• A supervisory approach to climate-related risks in banking that avoids front-loading requirements faster than wider regulatory reforms are consolidated.
The digital landscape. 
We believe digital transformation is a force for innovation and customer choice in banking. Banks have to be able to compete under fair terms with any player providing financial services. We continue to advocate for: • Ex ante competition rules that address the way in which gatekeepers could engage with business users and consumers. For example, in order to ensure fair access to data and critical infrastructure.
3 • A level playing field based on the principle of "same rules, same risks, same regulation and same supervision" to ensure that, when technology firms take on banking or payments activities and risks, they are regulated the same as banks or incumbent payments providers.
• An open finance regime in the EU and elsewhere in which consumers and users are given true power over all their relevant data, not just that held by banks, whose data is already open.
• A technology-neutral approach to regulation which allows banks to use technology (e.g. cloud, artificial intelligence) under the same conditions as technology companies and other competitors.
• The direct supervision of technology providers such as cloud computing services that provide critical infrastructure to the financial services sector.
• Discussions on Central Bank Digital Currencies should take into consideration the role the financial system plays in financing the economy.

While the results generally guide the overview of our financial situation in this consolidated directors’ report, we also use non-IFRS measures and Alternative Performance Measures (APMs) to assess our performance (see section 8 'Alternative Performance Measures' of this chapter). Thus, the main adjustments to our IFRS results consist of: • Underlying results measures: we present what we call underlying results measures which, in our view, provide a better year-on-year comparison because they exclude items outside the ordinary course of business that are grouped in the net capital gains and provisions line, and are further detailed at the end of section 3.2 'Results' of this chapter.
We also present underlying results by business area in section 4 'Financial information by segment' in accordance with IFRS 8 and reconcile them in aggregate terms to our IFRS consolidated results in note 51.c to the consolidated financial statements.
• Local currency measures: we use certain non-IFRS financial indicators in local currency to assess the ongoing operating performance of our business. They include the results from our subsidiary banks outside the eurozone (excluding the exchange rate impact). Because changes in exchange rates have a nonoperating impact on results, we believe evaluating performance in local currency provides management and investors an additional and meaningful assessment of performance. Section 8 'Alternative Performance Measures' of this chapter explains how we exclude the exchange rate impact from financial measures in local currency.
We have rounded certain figures in this consolidated directors’ report to present them more clearly. Accordingly, in certain instances, the amounts given in the totals columns and rows of tables may not match the total figure given for that column or row.
3.1 Situation of Santander. 
Santander is one of the largest banks in the eurozone. At the end of 2021, we had EUR 1,595,835 million in assets, EUR 1,153,656 million in total funds and a market capitalization of EUR 50,990 million.
Our purpose is to help people and businesses prosper in a way that is Simple, Personal and Fair. We do not merely meet our legal and regulatory obligations, but also aspire to exceed expectations. We focus on areas where our activity can have the greatest impact, supporting economic growth in an inclusive and sustainable way.
We engage in all types of typical banking activities, operations and services. Our track record, business model and strategic execution drive our aim to be the best open digital financial services platform, by acting responsibly and earning the lasting loyalty of our stakeholders (customers, shareholders, people and communities).
In 2021, with the global economy and society still feeling the effects of the covid-19 pandemic, we continued to play an active role in economic recovery and continued to support our 153 million customers and society.
Our priority for our 197,070 employees is to keep them safe and healthy in line with local government recommendations and based on three pillars: (i) development and implementation of health and safety protocols; (ii) remote working where necessary; and (iii) track and tracing (diagnostic tests, health apps and even vaccination centres in our corporate buildings for employees and the general public).
We are living in an increasingly digital world, and the covid-19 pandemic has spurred this transformation. As such, more than ever, our aim is to continue to offer our customers digital products and services that will meet their needs and support them in their digital learning. However, Santander continues to invest in ensuring access to financial services for our customers who are not digitally savvy, so that no one is left behind.
We interact with our customers through several channels. We have 9,879 branches and in recent years, have worked and invested to ensure our branches satisfy our customers' needs.
We have universal branches and specialist centres for certain customer segments, such as businesses and universities. We are also promoting new collaborative spaces with excellent digital capabilities (e.g. Work Café, SmartBank and Ágil branches). Additionally, our contact centres, which provide best-in-class service quality, continue to serve our customers.

Responsible Corporate Economic and Risk management Contents banking governance financial review and compliance. 
In addition, and in order to achieve greater penetration, we have also signed agreements with other companies and organizations, such as Correos and MAPFRE in Spain, which allowed us to increase our physical points of service by more than 7,000.
Through this process, while we enhance our branches, we are continuously investing in our digital capabilities and technological infrastructure to optimize our product and service proposition, reducing our cost to serve while remaining among the top banks in customer satisfaction in almost all our core markets.
As a result, the number of digital and loyal customers as well as digital activity continued to increase. We have more than 25 million loyal customers (+11% year-on-year), and have grown in both individuals and companies. Digital customers rose 12% in the year, exceeding 47 million. Similarly, digital sales accounted for 54% of total sales (44% in 2020 and 36% in 2019).
The world is also increasingly aware of the different environmental, social and corporate governance factors (most commonly known as ESG). We focus on delivering profitable growth responsibly and creating value for our 3.9 million shareholders. For more details, see the 'Responsible banking' chapter.
Our strategic priorities are essential to increasing our core businesses' profitability by offering simple, fair and innovative products.
Our strategy is based on three strategic initiatives: One Santander, Digital Consumer Bank and PagoNxt: • One Santander: a global project encompassing the three regions where we operate, that aims to sustainably create a bank that is better for our customers and more profitable and efficient for our shareholders. It consists of enhanced customer service, an omnichannel strategy and a common operating model in each region, enabling us to market simpler products.
• Digital Consumer Bank is the leading European bank in consumer finance, created on the back of Santander Consumer Finance's (SCF) scale and leadership position in the consumer business in Europe and the business and technology of Openbank's digital platform.
Its objectives include simplifying the legal and operating structure, redefining the business platform (auto, consumer and retail) to strengthen our leadership positions or grow faster with a fullydigital approach and maintaining high profitability and efficiency.
• PagoNxt is our legally and operationally independent global payments platform. It aims to bring together all of Santander's most innovative payments assets under one roof.
Its strategy is to continue to expand our global platforms; consolidate our retail leadership positions with Getnet; deploy One Trade's international payments services; implementing the instant functionality of Payments Hub in various markets; and continue to gradually migrate our global payments services and financial inclusion platform (Superdigital) in Latin America.
Santander also has two transversal global businesses: Santander Corporate and Investment Banking (SCIB) and Wealth Management and Insurance (WM&I), that add value to our local businesses.
SCIB integrates global corporate banking businesses for large companies and financial institutions that require tailor-made services and value-added wholesale products adapted to their complexity and sophistication. It is a highly profitable business that has delivered sustainable returns throughout the cycle. Its long-term strategy is to become our clients' strategic advisor of choice. Its priorities are expanding the content and products it offers to further transform us into our clients' strategic advisors to make strategic decisions and transform their businesses according to today’s demands for sustainability and digitalization. In addition, we aim to improve our position in the markets where we operate.
WM&I comprises our asset management, private banking and insurance businesses. It is very capital efficient, with significant growth potential and high returns. Our aim remains to become the best responsible wealth and protection manager in Europe and Latin America. That's why we continue to innovate and enhance our product proposition (especially in terms of ESG products). We are also increasing our sales through digital channels.
These strategic priorities, coupled with the pillars of our business model (scale, geographical presence and business diversification) will provide numerous opportunities for growth and greater profitability, while we continue to act responsibly and earn the trust of our stakeholders while generating more value for our shareholders.

Responsible Corporate Economic and Risk management Contents banking governance financial review and compliance. 
The average balance of interest-earning assets in 2021 was 4% higher than in 2020. Domestic and mature markets grew 4% (mainly in cash and demand deposits and in loans and advances to central banks and credit institutions) and developing markets increased 5% owing to volume growth in local currency in all country units.
The average return on interest-earning assets decreased from 3.45% in 2020 to 3.36% in 2021, with decreases in domestic (-6 bps) and mature international markets (-30 bps) while developing international markets increased 26 bps. By balance sheet item, cash, demand deposits and loans and advances to central banks and credit institutions fell 2 bps; and loans and advances to customers -7 bps, primarily driven by interest rates even lower than 2020. Debt securities rose 49 bps supported by developing markets.
The average balance of interest-bearing liabilities in 2021 was 4% higher year-on-year, also spurred by overall growth in the three markets (domestic: +6%; mature international: +2%; and developing international: +4%), boosted by customer deposits and deposits from central banks and credit institutions.
The average cost of interest-bearing liabilities fell 9 bps to 0.98% owing to the domestic (-8 bps) and mature international (-33 bps) markets while developing international markets were up 44 bps. By balance sheet item, there were reductions in central banks and credit institutions deposits (-27 bps); customer deposits (-6 bps); and marketable debt securities (-1 bp).
The change in interest income/(expense) shown in the table below was calculated as follows: • To obtain the change in volumes we apply the interest rate of the previous period to the difference between the average balances from the current and previous periods.
• To obtain the change in interest rate we apply the difference between the rates from the current and previous periods to the average balance from the previous year.
Interest income grew in the year driven by higher volumes, as interest rates had a negative impact. Interest expense dropped due to lower interest rates.
As a result, net interest income increased 4% favoured by both volumes and the interest rate effect, as shown in the table below summarizing the performance of net interest income by market. Excluding the exchange rate impact, growth was 7%.
This 7% increase in constant euros was due to higher credit and deposit volumes and the lower cost of deposits, partially offset by lower revenue due to even lower average interest rates in most of our markets.
By country, and at constant exchange rates, net interest income in the UK increased 22% due to the liability cost management and greater volumes (mainly in mortgages), +13% in Brazil due to higher volumes, +10% in Chile on the back of its margin and inflation management, +4% in Poland due to the pick up in interest rates in recent months, while in Spain there was a slight increase (+1%), because of its spread management.
In the US, net interest income decreased slightly, affected by disposals (Puerto Rico and the Bluestem portfolio). Excluding the impact of these disposals, net interest income would have increased 5%. In Mexico, we saw a 2% decrease due to lower average interest rates and ALCO portfolio sales in 2020 and there were also declines in Portugal, driven by lower interest rates in 2021.

Net fee income Santander's net fee income increased 5% compared to 2020, reaching EUR 10,502 million. Excluding the exchange rate impact, it was 8% higher, showing recovery quarter after quarter from the second quarter lows in 2020, driven by the rebound in activity.
Broad-based increases, notably fees relating to card turnover and points of sale (+26% and +38%, respectively). Fees from our asset management and insurance business as well as SCIB increased at double digits, demonstrating the strength of fees from value-added products and services.
Specifically, Santander Corporate & Investment Banking increased 16% on the back of the strong growth in markets and investment banking results. Wealth Management & Insurance grew 12% including fees ceded to the branch network. Together, both businesses accounted for close to 50% of the Group’s total (SCIB: 17%; WM&I: 32%).
By region, fees in Europe were up 9%, supported by growth in all countries except the UK (mainly due to regulatory changes in April 2020 that affect overdrafts). In North America, they decreased 1%, impacted by the disposals in the US; without them, growth in the region and the US would have been 6%, the same as in Mexico. Net fee income in South America was up 13% driven by all countries.
Gains or losses on financial assets and liabilities and exchange differences (net) Gains or losses on financial assets and liabilities and exchange differences (net) accounted for 3% of total income. They were 29% lower than the previous year at EUR 1,563 million (-27% excluding the exchange rate impact) mainly due to decreases in Spain (-29%), Mexico (-47%), Brazil (-12%), Chile (-25%) and the Corporate Centre. This was due to the positive impact from FX hedging, portfolio sales and higher market volatility in 2020.
Gains and losses on financial assets and liabilities stem from valuing trading portfolio and marked-to-market derivative instruments, which include spot market foreign exchange transactions, sales of investment securities and liquidation of our hedging and other derivative positions.
Operating expenses. 
For more details, see note 43 to the consolidated financial statements.
Exchange rate differences primarily show gains and losses from foreign exchange and the differences that arise from converting monetary items in foreign currencies to the functional currency, and from selling non-monetary assets denominated in foreign currency at the time of their disposal. Because Santander manages currency exposures with derivative instruments, the changes in this line item should be analysed together with Gains/(losses) on financial assets and liabilities.
For more details, see note 44 to the consolidated financial statements.
Dividend income Dividend income was EUR 513 million, 31% higher than in 2020 (+32% excluding the exchange rate effect), recovering some income that was affected by the decrease, delay or cancellation of dividend payments due to the pandemic (especially in Europe).
Income from companies accounted for by the equity method The income from companies accounted for by the equity method climbed to EUR 432 million in 2021 (in contrast to -EUR 96 million in 2020) owing to the higher contribution from the Group's associated entities.
Other operating income/expenses Other operating income/expenses recorded a gain of EUR 24 million compared to a loss of EUR 212 million in 2020 due to higher results obtained in insurance and leasing. In 2021, contributions made to the Single Resolution Fund (SRF) in the second quarter and to the Deposit Guarantee Fund (DGF) in the fourth remained stable.

Operating expenses Operating expenses increased 1% from 2020 to EUR 21,415 million. Excluding the exchange rate impact, costs rose 3% due to the general increase in inflation in 2021 and investments in technological and digital developments, including PagoNxt. However, in real terms (excluding the impact of inflation), however, costs fell 2%.
With an efficiency ratio of 46.2% - a 0.8 pp improvement on 2020 and 2019 (mainly driven by Europe) - we remained one of the most efficient global banks in the world.
We continue to make structural changes to reduce costs while improving customer satisfaction. Some businesses are migrating to regional platforms and simplifying products and services.
Efficiency ratio (cost to income) %
47.0 47.0 46.2 2019 2020 2021 -0.8 pp 2021 vs 2020. 
The trends by region and market in constant euros were as follows: • In Europe, costs were down 0.2% in nominal terms, -3% in real terms (excluding average inflation), as we continued with our cost reduction plan. In real terms, costs in Spain were down 11%, -4% in the UK and -6% in Portugal while costs in Poland increased 3% due to greater personnel costs. As a result, the region's efficiency ratio stood at 51.0%, a year-on-year decrease of 5.4 pp.
• In North America, costs increased 8%. In real terms, there was a net increase of 3% due to investments in digitalization, the 3% rise in the US and the 2% decrease in Mexico. The efficiency ratio was 45.2%.
• Soaring inflation in Argentina significantly distorted costs in South America (+8%). In real terms, costs declined by 5% in the region: Brazil, -8%, Chile, 0% and Argentina, -5%. The efficiency ratio in South America was 35.0%, a 1 pp decline compared to 2020.
• Lastly, Digital Consumer Bank's costs were 3% higher mainly due to perimeter effects and digital transformation investments. In real terms, they were flat and efficiency was stable at 45.0%.
Provisions or reversal of provisions Provisions (net of provisions reversals) amounted to EUR 2,814 million (EUR 2,378 million in 2020). They include the charges for restructuring costs and charges related to Swiss franc mortgages in Poland and Digital Consumer Bank (EUR 319 million in 2021).
For more details, see note 25 to the consolidated financial statements.
Impairment or reversal of impairment of financial assets not measured at fair value through profit or loss (net) Impairment or reversal of impairment on financial assets not measured at fair value through profit or loss (net) was EUR 7,407 million (EUR 12,382 million in 2020), a 40% decrease year-on-year in euros and -38% in constant euros.
This decrease was mainly due to the elevated level of additional loan-loss provisions recognized in 2020 based on the IFRS 9 forwardlooking view as well as the collective and individual assessments to reflect expected credit losses arising from covid-19. In 2021, approximately EUR 750 million of those provisions were released.
For more details, see section 3 'Credit risk' in the 'Risk management and compliance' chapter.
Impairment of other assets (net) The impairment of other assets (net) stood at -EUR 231 million, compared to -EUR 10,416 million in 2020 due a -EUR 10,100 million adjustment to the valuation of goodwill.

The Group’s cost of credit was 0.77%, a significant improvement compared to 2020 and 2019 (1.28% and 1.00%, respectively).
This performance was better than expected in light of the lower provisions in most of our markets in the year, particularly in the US, the UK, Digital Consumer Bank and Chile, together with the release of provisions recognized in 2020 at the end of 2021.

Customer funds, excluding the effect of exchange rate movements, rose 7% in 2021 as follows: • By product, customer deposits excluding repos were up 6%. Demand deposits grew 9% with rises in all markets, and time deposits fell 5%, as declines in Europe and North America more than offset growth in the main South American markets.

As a result, the weight of demand deposits as a percentage of total customer funds was 67%, while time deposits accounted for 15% of the total and mutual funds 18%.
In addition to capturing customer deposits, the Group, for strategic reasons, maintains a selective policy on issuing securities in international fixed income markets. We strive to adapt the frequency and volume of market operations to each unit's structural liquidity needs and to the receptiveness of each market.

Liquidity management in Santander. 
Our structural liquidity management aims to optimize maturities and costs, and to avoid undesired liquidity risks in funding Santander’s recurrent activity.
It follows these principles: • Decentralized liquidity model.
• Medium- and long-term (M/LT) funding needs must be covered by medium- and long-term instruments.
• High contribution from customer deposits due to the retail nature of the balance sheet.
• Wholesale funding sources diversified by instrument and investor; market and currency; and maturity.
• Limited recourse to short-term funding.
• Sufficient liquidity reserves (including standing facilities/discount windows at central banks to be used in adverse situations).
• Group and subsidiary level compliance with regulatory liquidity requirements, as a new factor conditioning management.
To apply these principles effectively across the Group, we developed a unique management framework based on three fundamental pillars: • Tight organization and governance that involve subsidiaries’ senior managers in decision-making and integrate them into our global strategy. Decisions about structural risks, including liquidity and funding risk, falls on the local asset and liability committees (ALCOs), which coordinate with the global ALCO. The global ALCO is empowered by the board of directors under the corporate Asset and Liability Management (ALM) framework.
This enhanced governance model is included within our risk appetite framework, which meets regulators and market’s demands for stronger risk management and control systems, in response to the financial crisis.
• In-depth balance sheet analysis and liquidity risk measurement that support decisions and control to ensure liquidity levels cover short- and long-term needs with stable funding sources, as well as minimize the impact of their cost on earnings.
Each geographic area has a conservative risk appetite framework, (based in its commercial strategy) which sets out the liquidity risk management framework. Subsidiaries must work within the framework limits to achieve their strategic objectives.
• Liquidity management adapted to the needs of each business. We develop a liquidity plan every year to achieve: – a solid balance sheet structure, with a diversified footprint in wholesale markets; – stable liquidity buffers and limited asset encumbrance; and – compliance with regulatory and other metrics included in each entity’s risk appetite statement.
We monitor all of the plan's dimensions throughout the year.
Santander continues to carry out the Internal Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Process (ILAAP). It is integrated into our other risk management and strategic processes to measure liquidity in ordinary and stressed scenarios. The quantitative and qualitative items we consider are also inputs for the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP).
Once a year, we must submit to supervisors a board-approved ILAAP assessment that shows our funding and liquidity structures will remain solid in all scenarios and our internal processes will ensure sufficient liquidity (based on analyses that each subsidiary conducts according to our local liquidity management model).
Our governance structure is robust and suited to identify, manage, monitor and control liquidity risks. It rests on common frameworks, conservative principles, clearly defined roles and responsibilities, a consistent committee structure, effective local lines of defence and well-coordinated corporate supervision.

Responsible Corporate Economic and Risk management Contents banking governance financial review and compliance. 
We produce frequent, detailed liquidity monitoring reports for management, control, reporting and steering purposes. We also send the most relevant information regularly to senior managers, the executive committee and the board of directors.
Over the last few years, Santander and each subsidiary have developed a comprehensive special situations management framework that centralizes our governance for such scenarios. It contains contingency funding plans, that are integrated within our governance model, with feasible, pre-assessed actions that follow a defined timeline; are categorized and prioritized; and provide for sufficient liquidity and execution time to mitigate stress scenarios.
Funding strategy and liquidity in 2021. 
Funding strategy and structure Our funding strategy in recent years has focused on extending our management model to all subsidiaries (including new additions).
It is based on a model of autonomous subsidiaries that are responsible for covering their own liquidity needs. This structure has enabled our solid retail banking model to maintain sound liquidity positions in the Group and our core country units, even amid market stress.
We have had to adapt funding strategies to commercial business trends, market conditions and new regulatory requirements. In 2021, we improved specific aspects, without significant changes in liquidity management or funding policies and practices. This will enable us to face 2022 from a strong starting point, with no growth restrictions.
In general, our subsidiaries continue to apply the same funding and liquidity management strategies: • maintaining sufficient and stable medium- and long-term wholesale funding levels.
• ensuring the right volume of assets which can be discounted in central banks as part of the liquidity buffer.
• generating liquidity from the retail business.
These developments have strengthened Santander's funding structure: • Customer deposits are our main source of funding. They are highly stable because they mainly arise from retail customer activity. At the end of December 2021, they represented just over two-thirds of net liabilities (i.e. of the liquidity balance sheet) and nearly 95% of loans and advances to customers. Their weight (as a percentage of loans and advances to customers) grew compared to end 2020. For more details, see the ‘Liquidity in 2021' section.

Assets Liabilities ■ ST funding ■ Financial assets ■ Equity and other ■ M/LT debt issuance ■ Fixed assets & other ■ Securitizations and others advances to ■ Loans and ■ Customer customers deposits • M/LT funding accounted for nearly 17% of net liabilities at the end of 2021, similar to 2020. It amply covers the retail funding gap (i.e. loans and advances to customers not funded by customer deposits).
The outstanding balance of M/LT debt issued in the market (to third parties) at the end of 2021 was EUR 173,652 million. Our maturity profile is comfortable and well balanced by instruments and markets with a weighted average maturity of 4.8 years (similar to the average maturity of 4.7 years at the end of 2020).

A. If an issuance has a put option in favour of the holder, its maturity is considered (not the contractual maturity). Note: There are no additional guarantees for any of the debt issued by the Group’s subsidiaries.
The lower weight of covered bonds in recent years in favour of other instruments is mainly due to the gradual construction of the MREL and TLAC requirements, as instruments with loss-absorbing capacity cannot have additional guarantees. Additionally, loan portfolios that are currently being used as collateral in central bank funding cannot be reused to issue secured instruments to the market.
In addition to the M/LT wholesale debt issuances, we have securitizations placed in the market as well as collateralized and other specialist funding totalling EUR 48,286 million (which includes EUR 6,935 million in debt instruments placed with private banking clients in Brazil). The average maturity is around 1.6 years.
This chart shows the similarity of the geographic breakdown of our loans and advances to customers and M/LT wholesale funding across our footprint. This distribution is almost identical to 2020 both in loans and advances and M/LT wholesale funding.

Wholesale funding from short-term issuance programmes is a residual part of Santander’s funding structure, which is related to treasury activities and comfortably covered by liquid assets.
The outstanding short-term wholesale funding balance at the end of 2021 was EUR 27,296 million. 50% was in European Commercial Paper, US Commercial Paper and domestic programmes issued by Banco Santander, S.A.; 22% in certificates of deposit and commercial paper programmes in the UK; 19% in Santander Consumer Finance (SCF) commercial paper programmes; and 9% in issuance programmes in other country units.
Liquidity in 2021 The key liquidity takeaways in 2021 are: • Basic liquidity ratios remain at comfortable levels.
• Regulatory ratios were well above minimum requirements.
• Our use of encumbered assets in funding operations was moderate.
In 2021, the transition back to business as usual began, after a 2020 marked by the frenetic activity of governments, regulators and central banks following the World Health Organization’s declaration of covid-19 as an epidemic and subsequently a pandemic.
At the end of 2021, central banks (albeit at different rates) began to withdraw or think about how to withdraw some of the stimulus measures (especially those relating to injecting liquidity into the system), put in place during the most acute phase of the crisis, without causing second-round effects.
With markets fully open in 2021, we regularly monitored our liquidity position in the special situations committees and the meetings held by the Group’s executive committee and board of directors. We also supplied information to the ECB at the regular monitoring meetings held by the Group during the supervisory dialogue process.

Our liquidity position has remained solid at all times. Moreover, the commercial activity in the year (discussed below), contributed liquidity in the year.
i. Basic liquidity ratios at comfortable levels. 
At the end of 2021, Santander recorded: • A stable credit to net assets ratio (i.e. total assets minus trading derivatives and inter-bank balances) of 75%. Such a high level compared to our competitors in Europe speaks to the retail nature of our balance sheet.
• A net loan-to-deposit ratio (LTD) of 106%, a very comfortable level (well below 120%) and down from the 108% in 2020. Lending grew moderately in constant euros in almost all our markets (except consumer businesses which were affected by the semiconductor and supply chain problems). However, deposit growth more than compensated the increase in lending.
• A customer deposits plus M/LT funding to net loans and advances ratio of 117% (similar to last year).
• Limited recourse to short-term wholesale funding (just over 2% of total funding) in line with previous years.
• Lastly, our structural surplus defined as the excess of structural funding sources (deposits, M/LT funding and capital) against structural liquidity needs from fixed assets and loans had an average balance of EUR 207,233 million in the year.
Our consolidated structural surplus stood at EUR 208,540 million. Fixed-income assets (EUR 149,057 million), equities (EUR 20,357 million) and net interbank deposits (EUR 60,423 million) were partly offset by short-term wholesale funding (-EUR 27,296 million). This totalled around 16% of our net liabilities (slightly up from the end of 2020).

A. Loans and advances to customers. 
In 2021, the key drivers of Santander's and our subsidiaries' liquidity (excluding the exchange rate impact) were: • Recovery in lending, except for Digital Consumer Bank (DCB), which remained stable, affected by the semiconductor crisis and supply chain problems which slowed production of cars and consumer goods. There was also generalized growth in customer deposits. As a result, the retail funding gap provided liquidity in the year.
• Issuances continued at a similar rate to the previous year and, overall, were in line with our funding plan for the year. By region, North America and DCB issued less than planned given business performance, while South America was more active in capital markets.
In 2021, Santander issued EUR 51,954 million in M/LT funding (at year-average exchange rates).
By instrument, the stock of M/LT fixed income debt (i.e. covered bonds, senior debt, subordinated debt and capital hybrid instruments) decreased by around 5% to EUR 29,030 million at the end of the year. The greater activity in senior, both preferred and TLAC eligible bonds, and in hybrids was not enough to offset low covered bond issuances. Securitizations and structured finance totalled EUR 22,924 million in 2021, a 35% increase year-on-year.
By country unit, Spain and Brazil issued the most M/LT fixed income debt (not including securitizations), followed by the UK. In the year, the greatest absolute increases were recorded in by our units in Spain and Brazil. The main year-on-year decreases occurred in the UK and SCF.

SCF and SC USA were the main issuers of securitizations.
The charts below provide show issuances by instrument and region:

Covered bonds: 1%
Preferred: 5% Subordinated: 5%
Europe: 43%

Covered bonds issued in 2021 accounted for 1% of total issuances, well below the 14% in 2020. Only Santander Brasil issued covered bonds in 2021. The main issuers in previous years, Spain and the UK, issued no covered bonds in 2021, for the reasons stated above (regarding central bank collateral). Senior debt accounted for 45% of total issuances, compared to 42% in 2020. The weight of TLAC eligible senior debt compared to senior preferred debt was lower than in 2020.
In 2021, the Group issued EUR 16,574 million in subordinated instruments, including EUR 11,282 million in senior non-preferred debt from Banco Santander, S.A. and senior preferred from the holding in the UK; EUR 2,698 million in subordinated debt; and EUR 2,593 million in AT1 eligible hybrid instruments issued by the parent bank.
In summary, we retained comfortable access to all our markets. In 2021, we issued and securitized debt in 17 currencies, involving 20 major issuers from 14 countries and an average maturity of 4.5 years (slightly lower than 4.8 years in 2020).
ii. Compliance with regulatory ratios. 
Within the liquidity management model, over the last few years Santander has been managing the implementation, monitoring and compliance with the liquidity requirements established under international financial regulations ahead of schedule.
Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) As the regulatory LCR requirement has been at the maximum level of 100% since 2019, we have set a risk appetite of 110% for the Group and subsidiaries.
Our strong short-term liquidity base and our core subsidiaries’ autonomous management led to compliance levels above 100% (both at Group and local level) throughout the year. Our LCR in December 2021 was 163%, well above the regulatory requirement.
The table below shows that all our subsidiaries substantially exceeded the required minimum in 2021 and the comparison versus 2020. Santander UK’s figures only include activities that the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 leaves within the Ring-Fenced Bank.

Chile 148% 155%
Argentina 258% 222%
Santander Consumer Finance 319% 314%
Group 163% 168%
NSFR (Net Stable Funding Ratio)
The final definition of the net stable funding ratio (NSFR) was approved by the Basel Committee in October 2014 and transposed to EU law in June 2019 when the Official Journal of the European Union published the Regulation (EU) 2019/876 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2019 amending Regulation (EU) No575/2013 as regards the leverage ratio, the net stable funding ratio, requirements for own funds and eligible liabilities, counterparty risk, market risk, exposures to central counterparties, exposures to collective investment undertakings, large exposures, reporting and disclosure requirements, and Regulation (EU) No 648/2012.
Accordingly, entities must have a net stable funding ratio, greater than 100% from June 2021.
The NSFR is a structural measurement that gives banks an incentive to ensure long-term stability and proper management of maturity mismatches by funding long-term assets with long-term liabilities. It is the quotient of available stable funding (ASF) and required stable funding (RSF).
ASF comprises sources of funding (i.e. capital and other liabilities) considered stable over one year. RSF primarily refers to any asset deemed illiquid over one year, thus needing to be matched with stable sources of funding.

In 2021, we defined a risk appetite limit of 101.5% both at the consolidated and subsidiary level.
The high weight of customer deposits (which are more stable); permanent liquidity needs deriving from commercial activity funded by medium- and long-term instruments; and limited recourse to short-term funding help maintain our balanced liquidity structure as reflected in our consolidated and subsidiary NSFRs above 100% in December 2021.
The table below provides details by main subsidiary as well as a comparison with 2020. Santander UK’s figures only include activities that the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 leaves within the Ring-Fenced Bank. Additionally, note that 2020 figures were calculated under the Basel methodology while 2021 calculations incorporate requirements as transposed to European law.
III. Asset Encumbrance. 
Santander’s use of assets as collateral in structural funding sources of the balance sheet is moderate.
In keeping with the 2014 European Banking Authority (EBA) guidelines on disclosure of encumbered and unencumbered assets, the concept of asset encumbrance includes on-balance-sheet assets.

Responsible Corporate Economic and Risk management Contents banking governance financial review and compliance. 
On-balance-sheet encumbered assets amounted to EUR 365.1 billion; 72% are loans and advances (e.g. mortgages and corporate loans). Off-balance-sheet encumbrance stood at EUR 80.7 billion and mainly relates to debt securities received as collateral in reverse repurchase agreements and rehypothecated ("reused"). Both types of encumbered assets amount to EUR 445.9 billion, giving rise to associated liabilities of EUR 325.2 billion.
At the end December 2021, total asset encumbrance in funding operations was 26.1% of the Group's extended balance sheet under EBA criteria (total assets plus guarantees received: EUR 1,708.0 billion), lower than the 26.6% at the end of 2020 mainly due to balance sheet growth.
Rating agencies. 
Rating agencies influence Santander’s access to wholesale funding markets and the cost of its issuances.
The agencies listed below regularly review our ratings. Debt ratings depend on several internal factors (business model, strategy, capital, income generation capacity, liquidity, etc.) but also on external factors related to economic conditions, the industry and sovereign risk across our footprint.
Sometimes the methodology applied by the agencies limits ratings to the sovereign's rating of country where the bank is headquartered. However, as a testament of our financial strength and diversification, Banco Santander, S.A. is still rated above the Kingdom of Spain's sovereign rating (where it is headquartered) by Moody’s, DBRS and Standard & Poor’s (S&P) and on par with it by Fitch.
At the end of 2021, the ratings from the main agencies were:
Rating agencies. 
Long term Short term Outlook. 
DBRS A (High) R-1 (Middle) Stable. 
Fitch Ratings A- (Senior A) F2 (Senior F1) Stable. 
Moody's A2 P-1 Stable. 
Standard & Poor's A+ A-1 Negative. 
Scope AAS-1+ Stable. 
JCR Japan A+ — Stable. 
In 2021, S&P upgraded the long-term rating to A+ due to a change in its methodology. DBRS, Fitch, Moody's and JCR Japan confirmed their ratings.
As for the outlook, Fitch changed from negative to stable due to the stabilization of the operating environment in Santander's main markets, while in December S&P, after having raised it in June, downgraded it back to negative due to the worsening of the sovereign's outlook, keeping Santander 1 notch above the Kingdom of Spain.
Funding outlook for 2022. 
Despite some lingering uncertainties, Santander has begun 2022 with a comfortable liquidity position and a positive funding outlook for the year.
We expect lending to rise moderately in all our core markets, coupled with a solid performance in deposits leading to limited demand for liquidity from our retail business. The largest liquidity needs will come from our largest country units: Spain, Brazil and Digital Consumer Bank.
The maturities in upcoming quarters are manageable, aided by limited recourse to short-term funding and an expected medium- and long-term issuance dynamic slightly greater than last year. We will manage each country, optimizing liquidity to maintain a solid balance sheet structure across our footprint.
Additionally, our funding plans take into account costs and diversification by instrument, country and market as well as the construction of liability buffers with loss-absorbing capacity in resolution (whether capital eligible or not). They are designed to ensure Santander and each subsidiary always satisfy regulatory requirements and those stemming from our risk appetite framework.
For example, Banco Santander, S.A.'s 2022 funding plan is designed to cover the greater TLAC/MREL requirements and pre-finance issuances that lose loss-absorbing capacity, and to cover any needs arising from potential increases in RWAs (which form the base for both ratios). As such, the plan includes between EUR 9 billion and EUR 10 billion of senior preferred and non-preferred debt, between EUR 3 billion and EUR 3.5 billion of hybrid instruments (depending on RWA growth to ensure the continued fulfilment of the 1.5% AT1 and 2% T2 buffers). The plan does not contemplate any covered bond issuances.
With regard to the rest of the Group: Santander Consumer Finance, plans to issue between EUR 5 billion and EUR 6 billion in senior instruments, as well as the possibility of up to EUR 0.5 billion in covered bonds; in the UK we expect to issue between EUR 3 billion and EUR 4 billion in senior debt (either from the bank or from its holding company) and between EUR 0.5 billion and EUR 0.75 billion in covered bonds; and, lastly, Santander Holdings USA plans to issue between EUR 2 billion and EUR 2.5 billion in senior debt.
Notwithstanding the above, Banco Santander, S.A. and the Group remain alert to opportunities to optimize the cost of outstanding issuances and may therefore decide to carry out additional issuances or reduce them.

Capital planning is an essential part of executing the three-year strategic plan.
Santander's capital function is carried out on three levels: →
Regulatory capital. 
The first step in managing regulatory capital is to analyse the capital base, the capital adequacy ratios under the current regulatory criteria and the scenarios used in capital planning to make the capital structure as efficient as possible, both in terms of costs and compliance with regulatory requirements. Active capital management includes strategies for allocation and efficient use of capital, together with securitizations, asset sales and issuances of equity instruments (hybrid equity instruments and subordinated debt).
→
Economic capital. 
The objective of the economic capital model is to ensure that we adequately allocate our capital to cover all risks to which we are exposed as a result of our activity and risk appetite. It also aims to optimize economic value added at the Group and business unit level.
→
Profitability and pricing. 
Creating value and maximizing profitability is one of Santander's main objectives, carefully selecting the most appropriate markets and portfolios based on profitability, taking into account risk. Profitability and pricing are therefore integral parts of the key capital model processes.

The main measures we took in 2021 were:
Issuances of capital hybrid and other loss-absorbing instruments. 
In 2021, Banco Santander, S.A. issued EUR 4,464 million in hybrid instruments. This comprised EUR 1,852 million in T2 subordinated debt and EUR 2,612 million in contingently convertible preferred shares (CoCos). Part of these CoCos were intended to replace the early amortization of a EUR 1,500 million issuance called in September 2021.
Banco Santander, S.A. also issued EUR 7,934 million in senior nonpreferred debt.
Dividends and shareholder remuneration. 
On 28 September 2021, the board announced its 2021 shareholder remuneration policy to pay out an interim distribution of approximately 40% of the Group's underlying profit (half through a cash dividend and half through a shares buyback).
• Interim remuneration. Accordingly, it authorized the payment of an interim dividend of EUR 4.85 cents per share (i.e. 20% of the Group's underlying profit for H1'21), in cash and charged against 2021 profits; it was paid on 2 November 2021. The board also voted to launch the First Buyback Programme worth EUR 841 million (20% of the Group's underlying profit for H1'21) once the ECB approved it on 28 September 2021. The number of shares acquired (259,930,273 shares) makes up approximately 1.499% of our share capital.
• Final remuneration. The board of directors voted to submit a resolution at the 2022 AGM for the approval of a complementary cash dividend of EUR 5.15 cents per share (gross), equalling an approximate total of EUR 865 million; and a Second Buyback Programme for EUR 865 million, to be approved by the ECB.
For more details, see section 3.3 ‘Dividends’ on the Corporate governance chapter.
Strengthen capital management culture. 
Focus ahead will remain on disciplined capital allocation and shareholder remuneration while we maintain our fully-loaded CET1 target between 11%-12%.
The continuous improvement in the capital ratios reflects our profitable growth strategy and a culture of active capital management at all levels of the organization.
In order to have a more global vision and simplify our structure, we created a new team, ‘Capital and Profitability Management’, in charge of our capital analysis, adequacy and management, coordination with subsidiaries in all matters related to capital and monitoring and measuring returns.
All the countries and business units have drawn up individual capital plans focused on achieving a business that maximizes the return on equity.
Santander gives a significant weight to capital and incentives. Certain aspects relating to capital management and returns are taken into account when setting the variable remuneration payable to members of senior management: • The relevant metrics include our CET1 ratio, the county units' capital contributions to the Group ratio, the return on tangible equity (RoTE) and profit after tax.
• The qualitative aspects considered include the proper management of regulatory changes affecting capital, effective management of capital relating to business decisions, sustainable capital generation over time and effective capital allocation.
Action plans. 
In addition, we have developed a three-year action plan for the continuous improvement of infrastructures, processes and methodologies that support all aspects related to capital, with the aim of further enhancing active capital management, responding more quickly to the numerous and increasing regulatory requirements and efficiently carrying out all associated activities.
We continue to improve our processes and controls associated with capital data quality. Additionally, we continuously develop risk management initiatives at both the consolidated and local levels to strengthen and fine-tune different activities.

The phased-in ratios are calculated by applying the CRR transitory schedules. At year-end, the total phased-in capital ratio was 16.81% and the (phased-in) CET1 ratio was 12.51%.
We have a strong capital base, comfortably meeting the minimum levels required by the European Central Bank on a consolidated basis (13.01% for the total capital ratio and 8.85% for the CET1 ratio). This resulted in a CET1 management buffer of 366 bps, compared to the pre-covid-19 buffer of 189 bps.

In models, changes arose from TRIM (Targeted Review of Internal Models) in Low Default Portfolios. In terms of asset size, of note was the impact from securitizations the Group carried out in the year.
In short, from a qualitative point of view, Santander's solid capital ratios are consistent with its business model, balance sheet structure and risk profile.
Economic capital Economic capital is the capital required to cover risks from our activity with a certain level of solvency. We measure it through an internal model. To calculate the required capital, we determine our solvency level based on our long-term rating target of 'A' (above the Kingdom of Spain's); this represents a confidence level of 99.95% (above the regulatory level of 99.90%).
Our economic capital model measurements cover all significant risks incurred in our activity (concentration risk, structural interest rate risk, business risk, pensions risk, deferred tax assets (DTAs), goodwill and others that are beyond the scope of regulatory Pillar 1). It also considers diversification, which is key to determining and understanding our risk profile and solvency in view of our multinational operations and businesses.
Our total risk and related economic capital are less than the sum of the risk and capital of all individual units combined. Because our business spans several countries in a structure of separate legal entities with different customer and product segments and risk types, our earnings are less vulnerable to adverse situations for any given market, portfolio, customer type or risk. Despite increasing economic globalization, economic cycles are not the same and countries are affected differently. This has been evident during the covid-19 pandemic. Groups with a global presence tend to have stabler results and are more resistant to the eventual market or portfolio crises which translates into lower risk.
In contrast to regulatory criteria, we consider certain intangible assets, such as DTAs or goodwill, to retain value, even in a hypothetical resolution, owing to the geographic structure of our subsidiaries. Thus, we can value assets and estimate their unexpected loss and capital impact.
Economic capital is an essential tool for internal management and the development of our strategy, assessing solvency and managing portfolio and business risk. As such, it is a key part of the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP).
Regarding Basel Pillar 2, we use our economic model for the internal capital adequacy assessment process (ICAAP). We plan business progression and capital needs under a central scenario and alternative stress scenarios to make sure we meet our solvency objectives even in adverse scenarios.
Economic capital derived metrics help us assess risk-return objectives, price operations based on risk, determine how economically viable projects are, and value country units and business lines to fulfil our overriding objective of maximizing shareholder value.
As a homogeneous risk measure, we can use economic capital to explain how we distribute risk throughout Santander, bringing together different activities and risk types under a single metric.
Given its relevance to internal management, Santander includes several economic capital-derived metrics from both a capital needs and a risk-return point of view, within a conservative risk appetite framework established at both Group and country unit level.
Required economic capital in December 2021 amounted to EUR 60,900 million. Compared to the available economic capital base of EUR 88,790 million, this implies a capital surplus of EUR 27,890 million.

RoRAC and Economic Value Added. 
Since 1993, Santander has been using risk-adjusted return (RoRAC) methodology to: • calculate economic capital consumption and return for business units, segments, portfolios and customers, to optimize capital allocation; • measure the management of units through budgetary monitoring of capital consumption and RoRAC; and • analyse and set prices to make decisions on operations (approvals) and customers (monitoring).
The RoRAC methodology helps us compare the return on operations, customers, portfolios and businesses on a like-for-like basis. We can identify what is obtaining a risk-adjusted return higher than its cost of capital and thus align risk and business management to maximize economic value added (EVA), which is senior management’s ultimate goal.
We regularly assess the level and progression of EVA and RoRAC across the Group. EVA is the profit generated above the cost of economic capital employed, and is calculated as follows:
Economic Value Added = underlying consolidated profit – (average economic capital x cost of capital)
We calculate profit by making the necessary adjustments to consolidated profit to eliminate factors outside the ordinary course of business and thus obtain each subsidiary’s underlying result for the year.
Additionally, for internal management purposes, we analyse the impact of items that are not covered by our economic capital model but affect reserves without being included in the income statement.
The minimum return on capital a transaction must obtain is determined by the cost of capital (i.e. the minimum compensation required by shareholders). We calculate it by adding the premium shareholders demand to invest in Santander to the risk-free return. The premium depends essentially on the degree of volatility in our share price with respect to market performance. Santander's cost of capital in 2021 was 10.08% (compared to 12.00% in 2020 impacted by higher volatility stemming from the covid-19 crisis).
On top of reviewing the cost of capital every year, Santander’s management also estimates a cost of capital for each business unit based on its features (under the philosophy that subsidiaries manage capital and liquidity autonomously) to determine whether each business is capable of creating standalone value.
If a transaction or portfolio obtains a positive return, it contributes to our profits, but only adds economic value when that return exceeds the cost of capital.
This table shows economic value added and RoRAC of the Group’s main geographical segments at the end of December 2021. The following figures reflect the economic value added in all the main segments:

Capital planning and stress tests. 
Capital stress test exercises are a key tool in banks' dynamic assessments of their risks and solvency. These forward-looking reviews are based on unlikely-but-plausible macroeconomic and idiosyncratic scenarios. They require robust planning models that can translate the effects defined in the projected scenarios to elements that affect solvency.
The ultimate aim of these exercises is to thoroughly assess risks and solvency to determine capital requirements if a bank fails to meet its regulatory and internal capital objectives.
Internally, Santander has a capital stress and planning process to respond to various regulatory exercises which is a key tool integrated within management and strategy.
Internal capital stress and planning aims to ensure sufficient current and future capital, even in unlikely-but-plausible economic scenarios. We estimate results in various business environments (including severe recessions as well as expected macroeconomic environments), based on our initial situation (financial statements, capital base, risk parameters and regulatory and economic ratios) to determine our solvency ratios, usually for a three-year period.
Planning offers a comprehensive view of our capital for the analysed period and in each of the defined scenarios based on regulatory capital and economic capital metrics.

This structure supports the ultimate objective of capital planning, by making it an important strategic element that: • ensures current and future solvency, even in adverse economic scenarios; • ensures comprehensive capital management, analyses specific effects and integrates them into strategic planning; • enables a more efficient use of capital; • helps formulate capital management strategy; and • facilitates communication with the market and supervisors.
Senior managers are fully involved in and closely supervise capital planning under a framework that ensures proper governance and is subject to the robust levels of challenge, review and analysis.
In capital planning and stress analysis exercises, calculating the required provisions under these stress scenarios is key, especially to cover losses on credit portfolios. It is particularly important for income statement forecasts under adverse scenarios.
To calculate loan-loss provisions of the credit portfolio, we use a methodology that ensures provisions cover loan losses projected by internal expected loss models, based on exposure at default (EAD), probability of default (PD) and loss given default (LGD parameters), at all times.
In 2018, we adapted this methodology to incorporate changes brought in by the new IFRS 9 regulations, with models to calculate balances by stages (S1, S2, S3) as well as the movements between them and the loan-loss provisions in accordance with the new standards.
Our capital planning and stress analysis culminate with an analysis of solvency under various scenarios over a set period to measure capital adequacy and ensure we meet all internal capital and regulatory requirements.
Should we fail to meet our capital objectives, we would draw up an action plan with the measures needed to attain the minimum capital desired. We analyse and quantify those measures as part of internal exercises even if we don't need to use them as we exceed the minimum capital thresholds.
Santander carries out its internal stress and capital planning transversally throughout the Group, at the consolidated and local level. Our country units use it as an internal management tool, particularly to respond to local regulatory requirements.
Since the beginning of the economic crisis in 2008, we have undergone eight external stress tests. All proved our strength and solvency in the most extreme and severe macroeconomic scenarios showing that, owing to our business model and geographic diversification, we would still be capable of generating a profit for shareholders while satisfying the most demanding regulatory requirements.
We have also conducted internal stress tests every year since 2008 as part of our ICAAP (Basel Pillar 2). Every test has proven our capacity to confront the most difficult exercises on a global and local level. These capital planning processes are carried out using shared tools throughout the Group.

Due to the special situation resulting from the covid-19 crisis, capital planning capacities and stress tests have allowed us to analyse various pandemic scenarios and ensure capital adequacy under the various possible scenarios derived from the crisis.
In 2021, we incorporated the analysis of the potential impact of climate risks (transition risk and physical risk) into the internal stress exercises in addition to being expressly considered in the definition of macroeconomic scenarios, in line with industry best practices and supervisory expectations.
ECB/EBA 2021 stress test In July 2021, the European Banking Authority (EBA) published the results of the stress tests carried out on the European Union's 50 leading banks. As in the previous exercise, it did not impose any minimum capital threshold to pass, rather the final results represent an additional variable for the ECB to determine each bank’s minimum capital requirement (as part of the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process - SREP). This exercise included two macroeconomic scenarios (base and adverse), taking the banks’ end-2020 balance sheet positions as a starting point, with a three-year time horizon (finishing in 2023). The very improbable adverse scenario considers a sharp deterioration in the macroeconomic environment and financial markets in Europe and the other countries where we operate. For example, the simulation included a cumulative fall in GDP of 3.6%, the impact of an increase in unemployment to 12.1% and a cumulative decline in housing prices of 16.1% in 2023 for the eurozone as a whole.
In the adverse scenario, Santander destroyed the least capital among its peers. Our fully-loaded CET1 capital ratio fell 258 basis points (vs the system average of -485 basis points) from 11.89% in 2020 to 9.31% in 2023.
Under the base scenario, Santander also generated the most capital among its peers.
We also generated more profit than our peers and we were the only bank not to incur a cumulative loss over the three-year horizon. In short, we are more resilient than our peers in Europe due to our highly recurrent revenue and profit, a testimony to the strength of our business model and diversification.

Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) and Minimum Required Eligible Liabilities (MREL) In November 2015, the FSB published the TLAC term sheet based on the previously published principles for crisis management frameworks. It aims to ensure global systemically important banks (G- SIBs) will have the capacity to absorb losses and recapitalize as required to maintain critical functions during and immediately after resolution proceedings without compromising customer funds, public funds or financial stability.
The TLAC term sheet requires each G-SIB to have an individually set minimum TLAC level which is the greater of (a) 16% of risk-weighted assets from 1 January 2019 and 18% from 1 January 2022, or (b) 6% of the Basel III Tier 1 leverage ratio exposure measure from 1 January 2019, and 6.75% from 1 January 2022.
Some jurisdictions have already transposed the TLAC term sheet into law (as is the case in Europe via the CRR 2 and BRRD 2, and in the US); however, other jurisdictions where we operate (e.g. Brazil), have yet to do so.
In Europe, the final texts of CRR 2 and BRRD 2, which amend the resolution framework, were published in June 2019. One of the main objectives of this revision was to implement the TLAC requirement in Europe.
The CRR 2, which came into force in June 2019, dictates the 16%/18% minimum requirement for G-SIBs as set in the TLAC term sheet. It must be made up of subordinated liabilities (with the exception of a percentage of senior debt - 2.5%/3.5%).
As of 31 December 2021, the TLAC of the resolution group headed by Banco Santander, S.A. stood at 26.86% of risk-weighted assets and 11.83% of the leverage ratio exposure.
The BRRD 2 was transposed into law in Spain in 2021.
G-SIBs also have a Pillar 2 requirement in addition to the minimum CRR requirement, owing to the MREL methodology in the BRRD 2.
In December 2021, Banco de España formally communicated the (binding) MREL requirement for the Banco Santander, S.A. Resolution Group (sub-consolidated), which needed be met from 1 January 2022. It was set at highest of 29.85% of the Resolution Group’s RWAs 1 and 13.82% of the Resolution Group’s leverage ratio exposure, based on 31 December 2019 data.
As of 31 December 2021, Banco Santander, S.A. met its MREL requirements having issued eligible instruments during the year. Specifically, 35.35% of RWAs and 18.47% of the leverage ratio exposure respectively.
Of the total MREL requirement, a minimum subordination level was fixed as the larger of 9.04% of RWAs and 6.02% of the leverage ratio exposure. However, the Resolution Group's minimum subordination is determined by TLAC, not by MREL, as the TLAC subordination requirement is greater In December 2021, the MREL subordinated figures of the Resolution Group headed by Banco Santander, S.A. were 32.22% and 16.83% respectively.
TLAC 2021 MREL 2021 % %
A. The CBR of 2.79% is obtained by multiplying the 3.51% CBR by the post-MPE Add-on RWAs and dividing the result by the Resolution Group’s total RWAs 1. When the requirement is set in terms of RWAs, the CET1 used to cover the combined capital buffers cannot be used to comply with the MREL requirement at the same time.

Responsible Corporate Economic and Risk management Contents banking governance financial review and compliance 3.6 Special Situations and Resolution. 
Corporate Special Situations and Resolution Framework, crisis management, Recovery and Resolution Planning. 
This section summarizes the main developments in preparing for a potential crisis, focusing on governance mechanisms, activities to prepare and strengthen recovery plans, and initiatives relating to preparing and improving resolvability plans.
Corporate framework for special situations and resolution As part of our corporate frameworks that regulate the internal governance of important matters that impact the Group's risk profile, we updated the special situations and resolution corporate framework. The board of directors ratified it in Q2 2021. Following corporate level approval, country units now adhere to the updated framework. The process of transposing and adapting the documents of the new crisis management and resolution regulatory tree to local requirements is being finalized.
The lessons learned so far from the covid-19 pandemic moved us to make significant changes to the framework which focus on: (i) early and pre-emptive identification of threats; (ii) coordination mechanisms between units; (iii) simplifying governance procedures; and (iv) promoting a crisis management preparation culture internally, including preparation for resolution and improving resolvability.
The framework enables our units, to comprehensively aggregate and clearly interpret the different mechanisms for monitoring, escalating and managing both financial and non-financial events as well as governance. It helps link the different action plans (e.g. contingency plans, business continuity plans, recovery plan, etc.).
We base crisis governance on a collective decision-making model, that is organized into and operated under severity levels to facilitate flexibility and sequential decision-making. For example, in the most severe stages of a hypothetical crisis, the “Gold" committee, composed of the Group’s main executives and supported by the “Silver" forum and other specialist "Bronze" teams, would be the leading decision-making body.
Furthermore, the framework aims to encourage (i) the sharing of best practices between units; and (ii) the continuous collaboration between local and corporate teams (including coordination in the recovery and resolution planning phases) to continue developing our management and control model in the most effective way.
Several training exercises were carried out in 2021, both at corporate and local levels, facilitating the necessary dissemination of the changes and collaborative discussions.
Regardless of these changes, Santander’s defining characteristic is its pursuit of excellence. We regularly run simulation and testing exercises to be better prepared for stress situations and to reinforce the collective awareness and culture of the crisis management function.
Recovery plans Context. Santander drew up its twelfth corporate recovery plan in 2021. It sets out measures we have at our disposal to survive a very severe crisis without extraordinary public aid, in accordance with article 5.3 of the BRRD.
Its primary aim is to test the feasibility, effectiveness and credibility of recovery measures as well as the suitability of the recovery indicators and their respective thresholds, above which decisionmaking will be escalated to cope with stress situations.
It sets out macroeconomic and financial crisis scenarios which incorporate idiosyncratic and/or systemic events that could lead the Group to trigger the plan.
The recovery plan should not be considered an instrument separate from our structural mechanisms to measure, manage and supervise risk. It includes the risk appetite framework (RAF), the risk appetite statement (RAS), the risk profile assessment (RPA), the business continuity management system (BCMS), the internal assessments of capital and liquidity (ICAAP and ILAAP) and other tools. It is also integrated into the Group's strategic plans.
Progress in 2021. In May, continuing the operational relief offered last year in response to the covid-19 pandemic, the ECB asked banks to focus efforts on the parts of the recovery plan that are essential for crisis preparation and management. We therefore focused on governance and escalation, indicators, measures and scenarios. With regard to the scenarios, the ECB asked banks to develop two stress scenarios related to the possible economic and financial consequences of the covid-19 pandemic: one systemic and one including an idiosyncratic element.
Like last year, and despite this easing of requirements, we prepared a comprehensive plan in 2021 that comprised all chapters and fully covered all of the ECB’s recommendations. Specifically: • New special situations and resolution framework.
• Two new indicator categories (macroeconomic and market) and new capital and asset quality indicators.
• New chapter explaining the Group’s subsidiary model and how local crises in the subsidiaries could affect the consolidated capital and liquidity ratios.
• Three stress scenarios to cover a wider range of crisis situations: idiosyncratic, regional and combined (global crisis plus idiosyncratic).
• Greater detail on total recovery capacity including a thorough analysis showing recovery capacity in each time bucket.
• New recovery measures.

Responsible Corporate Economic and Risk management Contents banking governance financial review and compliance. 
The key takeaways from our review of the 2021 corporate plan were: • No material interdependencies between country units.
• Ample recovery capacity in all scenarios from available measures, with an advantage in a recovery situation afforded by our geographic diversification model.
• Sufficient capacity in each subsidiary to emerge from a recovery situation on its own, strengthening capital and liquidity within our autonomous subsidiaries model.
• Sufficiently robust governance to manage financial and nonfinancial stresses varying in nature and intensity.
• Amid a serious financial or solvency event, no one subsidiary is important enough to trigger the corporate plan by causing the severest recovery indicator levels to be breached.
These factors prove our business model and geographic diversification strategy, based on autonomous subsidiaries, remain firm in a recovery situation.
Regulation and governance. Santander’s recovery plan complies with EU regulations and follows the non-binding recommendations of the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and other international bodies.
We submitted our latest plan to the Single Supervisory Mechanism in October 2021; the EBA has six months to make formal considerations.
It comprises the corporate plan (Banco Santander, S.A.) and local plans for the UK, Brazil, Mexico, the US, Germany, Argentina, Chile, Portugal, Norway and a recovery plan summary for Poland (as required). All country units (except Santander Chile and SC Germany) must draw up a local plan in compliance with local regulations and corporate requirements.
Though the board of Banco Santander, S.A. approves the corporate plan, relevant content and figures are previously submitted to and discussed by the Silver forum, Gold committee, risk control committee and the risk supervision, regulation and compliance committee. Local plans are approved by corresponding local bodies in coordination with the Group (as they are included in the corporate plan).
Resolution plans Santander cooperates with the relevant authorities to prepare resolution plans, providing them with all information they request. The members of the Crisis Management Group (CMG) upheld their decision on our Multiple Point of Entry (MPE) strategy 1 to be used in a hypothetical resolution.
This is based on our legal and business structure, organized into nine resolution groups that can be resolved independently without involving other parts of the organization.
Working meetings with the SRB and their communications (working priorities letters) confirmed that there are no impediments to the bank’s resolvability. In fact, the SRB highlighted the significant progress the Group has made in recent years (especially in 2020 and 2021) to improve its resolvability.
In 2021, we prepared our first three-year multi-year plan. Banco Santander, S.A.’s board of directors approved it in February 2021. It set out the following actions: 1) Ensure the bank establishes processes and develops capabilities to: (i) estimate liquidity needs for implementing the resolution strategy; (ii) duly provide information regarding the liquidity position in resolution; and (iii) identify and mobilize the available collateral to obtain funding during and after resolution.
In 2021, we identified key liquidity entities (KLEs) that (i) provide liquidity to other entities in the Group; (ii) depend on the liquidity received from other entities in the Group; or (iii) perform liquidity management functions for the Resolution Group.
We also identified the key liquidity drivers in resolution, which are factors that could potentially trigger a substantial change or deterioration in the bank's liquidity position in resolution.
Finally, we developed a methodology to identify, process and analyse relevant data to estimate the liquidity position in resolution.
2) Ensure information systems can quickly provide the high-quality information required in resolution.
We continued to make our governance of information provided to the resolution authority for drawing up resolution plans stronger and more systematic, including the following projects in 2021: 1. Automation of Santander Consumer Finance's liability data report and additional liability report.
2. Automation of Banco Santander, S.A.’s TLAC/MREL reports.
3. Automated production of the necessary data to carry out a valuation exercise in resolution.
4. Automated production of the dataset for bail-in.

Responsible Contents banking 3) Guarantee operational continuity in resolution situations.
In 2021, we identified essential services that support core business lines, as well as their operational assets and critical personnel. We also redrafted any service contracts that did not contain the operational continuity clause to include said clause.
We continued to work on making contingency plans for market infrastructure services more operational and executive.
4) Foster a culture of resolvability.
Santander continued to involve more senior managers in resolution planning. We escalated the multi-year plan, which includes the resolution work streams, to the board. We also presenting its progress to other high-level committees (such as the Gold committee, Silver forum, and other bodies). The board and senior management also received resolution training in 2021.

Responsible Corporate Economic and Risk management Contents banking governance financial review and compliance 4. Financial information by segment 4.1 Description of segments. 
We base segment reporting on financial information presented to the chief operating decision maker, which excludes certain statutory results items that distort year-on-year comparisons and are not considered for management reporting. This financial information (underlying basis) is computed by adjusting reported results for the effects of certain gains and losses (e.g. capital gains, write-downs, impairment of goodwill, etc.). These gains and losses are items that management and investors ordinarily identify and consider separately to better understand the underlying trends in the business (see also note 51.c to the Santander financial statements).
Santander has aligned the information in this chapter with the underlying information used internally for management reporting and with that presented in the Group's other public documents.
Santander's executive committee has been selected to be its chief operating decision maker. The Group's operating segments reflect its organizational and managerial structures. The executive committee reviews internal reporting based on these segments to assess performance and allocate resources.
The segments are split by geographic area in which profits are earned and type of business. We prepare the information by aggregating the figures for Santander’s various geographic areas and business units, relating it to both the accounting data of the business units integrated in each segment and that provided by management information systems. The same general principles as those used in the Group are applied.
On 9 April 2021, we announced that, starting and effective with the financial information for the first quarter of 2021, we would carry out a change in our reportable segments to reflect our new organizational and management structure.
These changes in the reportable segments aim to align the segment information with their management and have no impact on the Group’s accounting figures.
a. Main changes in the composition of Santander's segments made in April 2021. 
The main changes, which have been applied to management information for all periods included in the consolidated financial statements, are the following:
Primary segments 1. Creation of the new Digital Consumer Bank (DCB) segment, which includes: • Santander Consumer Finance (SCF), previously included in the Europe segment, and the consumer finance business in the United Kingdom, previously recorded in the country.
• Our fully-digital bank Openbank and the Open Digital Services (ODS) platform, which were previously included in the Santander Global Platform segment.
2. Santander Global Platform (SGP), which incorporated our global digital services under a single unit, is no longer a primary segment. Its activities have been distributed as follows: • Openbank and Open Digital Services (ODS), which, as mentioned above, are now included under the new Digital Consumer Bank reporting segment.
• The business recorded in Global Payment Services (Merchant Acquiring, International Trade and Consumer) has been allocated to the three main geographic segments, Europe, North America and South America, with no impact on the information reported for each country.
Secondary segments 1. Creation of the PagoNxt segment, which incorporates simple and accessible digital payment solutions to drive customer loyalty and allows us to combine our most disruptive payment businesses into a single autonomous company, providing global technology solutions for our banks and new customers in the open market, and which has been structured into three businesses, previously included in SGP: • Merchant Acquiring: acquiring solutions for merchants.

António Simões common operating model”
Regional Head of Europe and CEO of Santander Spain. 
Strategy Business performance 1 Results 1. 
Our strategy in Europe is to maintain the focus on customer experience and service quality, while making the necessary structural changes to develop a common operating model across the region. 
Customer funds rose 6% driven by retail deposits and mutual funds. Loans and advances to customers were 3% higher, with strong growth in individuals. 
Underlying attributable profit rose 110% year-on-year underpinned by NII and net fee income growth, efficiency improvement and the lower cost of credit 1. Excluding the exchange rate impact.
Strategy. 
The aim of One Santander is to create a better bank in Europe, that our customers and employees feel a deep connection with while delivering sustainable value to shareholders and society by: • serving our customers better to grow our business, focusing on capital efficient opportunities (including SCIB and WM&I), simplifying our mass market value proposition, improving customer experience and engaging with PagoNxt; • making headway with our omnichannel strategy, redefining customer interaction, accelerating our digital agenda and maintaining close relationships through our teams; and • creating a common operating model, to serve our businesses through shared technology platforms and automated operations, leveraging shared services. This should enable us to become a more agile organization with one aligned team across Europe.
Our ongoing structural changes aim to deliver revenue growth and significant cost savings, resulting in positive operating jaws. This is consistent with the commitment we announced in October 2020 to deliver EUR 1 billion additional cost savings by 2022 year end.
In 2021, we laid the foundations for our transformation, through structure simplification, the convergence to our Everyday Banking value proposition across the countries, the launch of a common app in Spain, Portugal and Poland, and started to offer homogeneous payment products. As a result, we: • improved service quality, reflected in achieving a top 3 NPS position in our core markets; • increased revenue and improved efficiency 5.4 pp year-on-year; and • doubled Europe's return on equity in terms of underlying RoTE, from 3.6% in 2020 to 7.4% in 2021.

Responsible Corporate Economic and Risk management Contents banking governance financial review and compliance. 
The strategy by country in 2021 was as follows:
Spain. 
Economic activity picked up in the year, particularly reflected in individuals.
• In individuals, higher demand for loans and positive trends in protection insurance drove commercial dynamism. All of this was channelled through our mobile app.
• In corporates, performance was largely shaped by ICO loans granted in 2020, coupled with the integrated management platform for Next Generation EU programmes (available to customers and non-customers).
• In Private Banking, we consolidated our position as market leader through customer attraction and digital interaction.
• In SCIB, we maintained our leadership in volumes and number of transactions in the main league tables.
In line with One Santander's regional strategy in Europe, we continued to make headway with business transformation and product simplification.
We incorporated the more than 3,000 MAPFRE points of sale where our products are offered. We also launched the rebranding campaign Por ti, los primeros.
We continued to push our digital transformation process and develop new product, services and process capabilities. Our app for individuals, rolled out in 2020, led the Aqmetrix ranking and was successfully exported to other countries such as Portugal and Poland. We also launched a new app and website for businesses, including a wider service proposition. As a result, Euromoney named us Best Digital Bank in Western Europe in 2021.
United Kingdom. 
We are delivering on our strategy, focusing on improved customer loyalty.
We continued to enhance our operating model, by digitalizing the business while simplifying its structure and automating processes.
• The number of digital customers reached 6.6 million, up 6% year-on-year.
• We completed the transfer of the wholesale banking business out of the UK perimeter, separating it from the retail banking and asset management businesses.
• We enhanced our Breakthrough initiative that helps companies (mainly SMEs) to re-focus their strategies post-pandemic.
We continued to run One Santander-related projects, such as the Transformation for Success programme aimed at boosting productivity.
Portugal. 
Against a backdrop of economic recovery, our main priority was to increase customer loyalty by: • implementing a more agile and simpler commercial and digital transformation plan, that built on already high customer satisfaction; • strengthening our position as the leading bank in lending, following double-digit growth in new mortgage lending and above-market increases in corporate loans, while maintaining high credit quality; and • maintaining our leadership in efficiency without compromising quality customer service.

Poland. 
Following the impact of the covid-19 crisis in 2020, we focused on returning to pre-pandemic activity levels and to position our brand as one of the banks with the highest customer satisfaction ratings, ranking top 3 in 2021 by NPS.
• We focused on digitalizing and simplifying our catalogue, which reduced the number of marketed products, processes and the complexity of the organization.
• In retail banking, we streamlined online processes for account openings which led to an increase in the number of digital customers (+9% year-on-year) and record new lending.
• In business and corporate banking, we focused on the development of the iBiznes24 app (launched in 2020) and used it to build a common platform to offer comprehensive services to our customers.
Business performance The individuals segment recorded sharp growth in all countries. In line with our strategy, WM&I also grew strongly and CIB increased its revenue at double-digit rates.
Loans and advances to customers were 5% higher year-on-year. In gross terms, excluding reverse repurchase agreements and the exchange rate impact, they rose 3%. We saw broad-based growth in all countries especially in mortgages in the UK, individuals in Spain, mortgages and SMEs in Portugal and individuals, SMEs and CIB in Poland.

Results. 
Underlying attributable profit in 2021 was EUR 2,978 million (28% of the Group's total operating areas). Compared to 2020, underlying attributable profit was up 111% and +110% in constant euros, as follows: • Total income was up 11%, with increased net interest income (+10%), benefitting from higher volumes, interest rate management and the positive TLTRO impact. Net fee income rose 9% spurred by greater commercial activity and business growth in WM&I and CIB.
• Despite inflation, increased activity and necessary investments in IT, significant restructuring efforts in all countries and cost control left administrative expenses and amortizations flat by year-end. As a result, net operating income rose 24%.
• Net loan-loss provisions dropped 32% compared to 2020, due to covid-19-related provisions recorded in 2020 that were partially released in 2021.
• Other gains (losses) and provisions increased 32%, mainly due to Swiss franc mortgage-related charges.

Underlying attributable profit Spain EUR 957 Mn. 
Business performance Activity in the individuals segment picked up in 2021, especially in residential mortgages (where we reached record highs in new lending), and in consumer credit (which recovered to pre-pandemic levels in Q2). As a result, we gained market share in both products.
In corporates, signs of recovery emerged in H2'21, with growth in working capital management (+15% year-on-year). However, the demand for loans slumped due to the extensions of grace periods in ICO funding and expectations regarding the Next Generation EU funds.
In transactional products, we gained significant market share and expanded our customer base in PoS, which was reflected in a 44% increase in turnover compared to the previous year. Both credit and debit card turnover rose 17% year-on-year.
Loans and advances to customers rose 0.4% versus 2020. In gross terms, excluding reverse repurchase agreements, growth was also 0.4%, driven by individuals and institutions.
Customer deposits increased 5% compared to 2020. Excluding repos, growth was also 5%. Mutual funds grew 16% driven by sustained net positive inflows in the last seven quarters. Customer funds rose 8%.
Results Underlying attributable profit amounted to EUR 957 million (9% of the Group’s total operating areas), 85% higher than 2020. By line: • Total income increased 3% propelled by the positive performance in net fee income (+7%), driven by transactional fees, insurance, and mutual funds, and, to a lesser extent, net interest income (+1%), supported by TLTROs.
• Our cost reduction efforts continued to bear fruit (-7% year-onyear), improving the efficiency ratio by 5.5 pp to 47.7%. Net operating income increased 15%.
• Net loan-loss provisions fell 8%, which enabled the cost of credit to improve 9 bps year-on-year.
• Other gains (losses) and provisions increased due to higher operational risks and contingencies.

Business performance. 
We delivered a very strong performance in 2021 against a challenging backdrop. Our strategy remains focused on customer loyalty, simplification, improved efficiency and sustainable growth, while delivering outstanding customer experience. We are transforming the business to meet changing customer needs and delivering on our purpose to help people and businesses prosper.
The increasing use of digital channels is demonstrated by our retention of 72% of refinanced mortgage loans thanks to new digital retention journeys, and we opened 90% of new current accounts and 98% of credit cards through digital channels. We also transformed our ways of working and reduced our head office and branch property estate.
Strong mortgage growth, with GBP 7.5 bn net mortgage lending (GBP 30.7 bn of gross new lending) in a buoyant housing market. This performance was not reflected in total lending balances due to the transfer of the CIB business to the London branch. In gross terms excluding repos and the FX impact, loans and advances to customers were 0.5% higher.
Customer deposits rose 5%. Excluding repurchase agreements and the exchange rate impact, customer deposits and total customer funds saw no material change. Mutual funds were 6% higher.
Results. 
Underlying attributable profit was EUR 1,570 million in 2021 (15% of the Group’s total operating areas), four times that of 2020. In constant euros, growth was 288%, as follows: • Total income was up 18%, driven by net interest income growth (+22%) from increased lending volumes and lower cost of funding.
• Administrative expenses and amortizations dropped 1%, due to efficiency savings from our transformation programme, offsetting ongoing investments in IT and the business, as well as costs related to greater activity. As a result, net operating income was up 52%.
• We recorded a net credit impairment write-back of EUR 245 million, due to the improved economic outlook and partial release of covid-19 provisions from 2020.
• The negative impact from other gains (losses) and provisions increased compared to 2020, owing to legal contingencies.

Business performance In 2021, we focused on recovering pre-pandemic levels. We rapidly enhanced our digital capabilities, regaining the third position in NPS, and aligned our commercial proposition with our customers' needs.
Loans and advances to customers rose 6%. In gross terms, excluding reverse repurchase agreements and exchange rate impact, growth was also 6%, driven by retail, where we hit record highs in mortgage sales, digital loans, bancassurance and SME lending. In CIB, we consolidated our market leadership as one of the country's preferred banks for executing capital market transactions.
Customer deposits increased 9% compared to 2020, +10% excluding repos and the exchange rate impact. Demand deposits spiked in wholesale banking, individuals and SMEs. Mutual fund growth remained positive, boosting growth in customer funds (+10% in constant euros).
Results Underlying attributable profit amounted to EUR 161 million (2% of the Group’s total operating areas). Compared to 2020, profit dropped 1% but grew 2% in constant euros, as follows: • Total income was 11% higher driven by transactional and WM&I fee income, and net interest income, as NII pressures eased following interest rate hikes in Q4.
• Administrative expenses and amortizations were up 8% affected by high inflation and costs related to the rebound in activity. Net operating income rose 13%.
• Loan-loss provisions plummeted, which enabled cost of credit to improve.
• The negative impact from other gains (losses) and provisions (including the charges related to Swiss franc mortgages which distort the year-on-year comparison) increased 113% to -EUR 404 million.

Strategy. 
In North America, our aim is to create a joint value proposition that boosts profitable growth in the region by leveraging the US's and Mexico's individual strengths and the Group’s global digital platforms.
In 2021, we continued with our strategy to deploy capital to the most profitable businesses.
• In Q1, the Group announced its intention to repurchase the outstanding c. 8.3% stake in Santander México it did not own. This transaction closed in Q4 with the Group having paid MXN 5.17 bn for Santander México shares and USD 138.5 million for its ADSs acquired in this operation, increasing its stake by 4.5% to 96.2%.
• In Q2, BSI completed the acquisition of the Miami office of Crédit Agricole's global wealth management company.
• In Q3, SHUSA entered into a definitive agreement with SC USA to acquire the remaining common SC USA stock that it did not own. This deal closed on 31 January 2022.
• Also in Q3, SHUSA reached an agreement to acquire Amherst Pierpont Securities however it remains subject to completion, regulatory approval and other conditions.
Synergies between countries leverage joint initiatives in our regional strategy, including: • further development of the USMX trade corridor. Revenue increased as CIB and Commercial Banking continued to deepen relationships with existing customers; • boosting customer attraction and retention through loyalty strategies, while broadening our tailored products and services proposition for a more straightforward customer experience. We are also working on developing payment solutions for the USMX trade corridor and leveraging PagoNxt in line with the Group’s strategy; • improved customer interaction through new segmentation. In the US, we launched a value proposition aimed at servicing affluent customers. In Mexico, we implemented a service model for highincome customers differentiating the value proposition into three segments for a more customer-focused experience; and • leveraging our regional capabilities to optimize expenses, improve profitability and increase collaboration between the US and Mexico and with the Group and continue reducing duplication in the operating model, platform and architecture.
We are also consolidating IT functions across the region to address common challenges, comprising operations (know-how, digitalization, hubs, front-office and back-office) and the integration of the regional IT platform, MEXUS.

Our strategy by country in 2021 was as follows:
United States. 
Santander US is positioned to maintain profitability above cost of capital across core businesses.
We are refocusing our operations in the US around our consumer franchise and fee-based businesses that benefit from the Group’s connectivity or have a distinct competitive advantage.
The simplification of our US businesses anchored in disciplined expense management and capital allocation is leading us to discontinue our home lending product operations and to review certain C&I segments.
The strategic investments we announced in 2021 will improve our competitiveness and capture revenue and cost synergies (Amherst Pierpont and SC USA minorities).
Our strategy has four key pillars: • Simplify our operating model (One Santander US): optimize our Auto business by integrating our origination and funding strategy across our bank and finance company platforms.
• Drive organic growth across our profitable business lines: – Consumer: Become a more relevant player in auto near-prime and prime segments through other OEM partnerships and relationships with large national dealer groups.
– Commercial: Expand multifamily direct origination capabilities.
– CIB: Deepen and up tier relationships with corporates; successfully integrate APS/SIS.
– Wealth Management: Offshore market growth and capabilities to compete in the onshore market for Latin American individuals domiciled in the US.
• Transformation of Consumer and Commercial Banking segments: Enhance value proposition, customer service and digital capabilities and drive a customer-centric mindset across the organization to deliver customer growth and product penetration.
• Long term optionality: global Group initiatives to drive optionality in digital banking and payments.
Mexico. 
Multichannel innovation and digital channel momentum continued to strengthen our value proposition and introduce new products and services, allowing us to improve our customer attraction and loyalty strategy.
• We continued to make headway with projects to generate synergies between commercial areas, in particular the project to increase profitability through the attraction of new payrolls and portabilities. We also improved our value proposition for collections and payments through new commercial alliances.
• Our digital focus prompted campaigns to promote the use of electronic signatures and digital cards, such as the Like-U credit card, which allows customers to make online purchases, tailor benefits and support social causes.
• We strengthening our real-time capabilities and implementing direct communication via WhatsApp to provide more direct and fluid digital customer assistance.
• We confirmed a deal to partner with Samsung and MasterCard and launched Members Wallet, which includes such services as financing, payments, and balance and movement queries.
In mortgages, we are one of the main originators due to our innovative products and services, such as Hipoteca Plus and Hipoteca Free. We were the first bank in Mexico to offer an interest rate tailored to the customer’s profile.
In auto, we doubled our market share in one year. It exceeded 12% in December, due in part to a new alliance with Honda (together with the already established partnerships with Mazda, Tesla, Suzuki, Peugeot, among others).
In SMEs, partnerships with Contpaqi and Getnet helped attract digital customers. We launched Getnet’s G Store, an initiative that enables SMEs to digitalize their business through an online store, developed by a professional team. We signed commercial alliances with the main chambers of commerce and launched TDC Agro which provides financing adapted to production cycles.
We continued to promote financial inclusion and empowerment through Tuiio. We were named World’s Best Bank for Financial Inclusion by Euromoney.

Business performance. 
Loans and advances to customers grew strongly year-on-year, up 14%. In gross terms, excluding reverse repurchase agreements and the exchange rate impact, they rose 3% boosted by overall growth in Mexico (except SMEs) and lending growth in auto in the US. Without the impact of the Bluestem portfolio disposal, growth was 4%.
Customer deposits grew significantly compared to 2020 (+19%). Excluding repurchase agreements and the exchange rate impact, growth was 7% driven by retail and corporate deposits in the US and demand deposits in Mexico.
Mutual funds were up 15% in constant euros owing to our strong performances in both countries, reflecting the high level of liquidity in the market and success with our customer attraction and loyalty strategy. As a result, customer funds increased 9% in constant euros.

Results. 
Underlying attributable profit in 2021 was EUR 3,053 million (29% of the Group's total operating areas).
Compared to 2020, underlying attributable profit more than doubled; +107% in euros (+109% in constant euros). The year-on-year comparison by line was distorted due to the impact of the Bluestem portfolio and Puerto Rico disposals. Without them and the exchange rate impact, growth was 111%, as follows: • Total income was up 5%. Net interest income grew 3% as price management and hedging in the US more than offset lower net interest income in Mexico due to the negative impact of lower interest rates and ALCO portfolio sales in 2020. Net fee income grew 6% and leasing results increased 48%; • Administrative expenses and amortizations rose 10% primarily due to inflation and investments in digitalization. The efficiency ratio stood around 46%; • As a result, net operating income increased 2%; • Net loan-loss provisions plummeted 66% due to better market outlooks and a healthier operating environment, following heavy covid-19-related provisioning in 2020. The cost of credit improved notably to 0.93%, the NPL ratio stood at 2.42% and coverage was 135%; and • Other gains (losses) and provisions were more negative in 2021 mainly due to the early amortization of buildings and integration costs in the US.

Business performance Loans and advances to customers increased 14% compared to 2020. In gross terms and excluding reverse repurchase agreements and the impacts of both the exchange rate and the Bluestem portfolio disposal, they grew 3% year-on-year as lending growth in CIB and auto more than offset tepid corporate demand. Considering the Bluestem portfolio disposal impact, loans increased 2%.
Auto originations climbed 13% versus 2020 as our consumer business further leveraged its strong deposit base to support originations across the full credit spectrum.
Customer deposits soared 23% year-on-year. Excluding repurchase agreements and the exchange rate impact, customer deposits grew strongly (8% higher), boosted by retail deposits.
Mutual funds also increased 23% excluding the exchange rate impact.

Though net interest income growth was impacted by loan volumes and interest rate pressure, it still increased 5% due to focused deposit price management. Net fee income increased 6% due to CIB and Wealth Management. Other operating income improved 53%, primarily due to outstanding auto lease results; • Administrative expenses and amortizations increased 10% due to increased activity and investments in strategic initiatives (such as digital transformation), as well as a USD 60 million donation to our community foundation in Q3 and Q4. Excluding the latter, costs rose 8%, resulting in a 3 pp increase in operating leverage; • Net loan-loss provisions plummeted 85% on the back of lower net charge-offs, better macroeconomic conditions and strong used vehicle prices; • The negative impact of other gains (losses) and provisions increased by 31%, mainly due to the early amortization of buildings and integration costs.

By line: • Total income fell 4%, impacted by lower gains on financial transactions (sales of ALCO portfolios in 2020) and net interest income (-2%), the latter a result of interest rate cuts and lower ALCO portfolio volumes. Net fee income increased by 6%, mainly due to transactional fees and insurance; • Administrative expenses and amortizations increased 4%, well below inflation, mainly driven by technology costs and the increase in amortizations; • As we move to a more normal operating environment, net loanloss provisions were down 21%, following the high levels recorded in 2020 due to the pandemic; • Other gains (losses) and provisions improved 49% mainly due to the sale of foreclosed assets and lower contingencies charges.

In Argentina, we partnered with a major energy provider on renewable energy financing.
As a result, we were named the Best Bank for Sustainable Finance in Latin America in 2021 by Euromoney. Santander Chile was recognized by Global Finance as Outstanding Leader in Sustainable Finance in Latin America (alongside Santander México).

Jose Luis de Mora “We are dedicated to supporting our partners and developing. 
CEO SCF advanced technologies to give them a competitive edge, enabling us to become the top mobility financer and provider in Europe"
In 2021 management focused on: • Auto: strengthening our auto financing leadership position by: renewing existing agreements and entering into new ones with car manufacturers, importers and dealers; reinforcing our leasing business; and developing new services (e.g. subscriptions) across our footprint. SCF also focused on providing advanced online financing capabilities to its partners to help boost their sales growth.
The Auto business closed 2 million new contracts in 2021. By the end of the year, it was managing a loan book of EUR 91 billion.
• Consumer (Non-Auto): gaining market share in consumer financing solutions by leveraging our position to grow in ecommerce, checkout lending and buy now, pay later (BNPL).
The Consumer (Non-Auto) business closed 6 million new contracts in 2021. As at 31 December 2021, it managed a loan book of EUR 20 billion.
In retail, we focused on improving digital capabilities to inspire loyalty among our 3.7 million retail (Openbank and SC Germany Retail) customers and to boost digital banking activity.
• Cost reduction and simplification: accelerating digitalization to transform the business and improve efficiency. The main drivers were: – organizational simplification by transitioning from banking licences to branches in the Western hub. SCF is already working through branches in Portugal, Belgium, the Netherlands and Greece; – streamlining IT by leveraging technology and data capabilities with digital banking apps (APIs) and a Banking as a Service (BaaS) model.
During 2021, DCB signed new agreements with retail distributors and manufacturers, supporting them in their commercial transformation and increasing the value proposition for end customers. We executed strategic deals to strengthen our presence in Europe in order to maintain our auto finance leadership and boost digital channels including: • the acquisition of Sixt Leasing in Germany (renamed Allane); • the kick off of the joint consumer finance venture with Telecom Italia Mobile in Italy, deploying a new consumer finance solution (for smartphones, modems, eWatches, etc.) which was used by more than 5,500 active retail points of sale and financed more than 600,000 TIM customers in 2021; • SCF's acquisition in the second half of 2021 of a 14.7% stake in Vinturas Holding, a company with a blockchain-based technology solution which allows manufacturers to digitally track vehicles throughout the entire logistics process, supporting our focus on digitalization; and • a non-binding agreement with Stellantis (the world's fourth largest car manufacturer) signed in December to renegotiate the terms of cooperation (binding contracts expected to be signed in Q1 2022). This new agreement will enable us to broaden our scope and be the captive financing partner for all Stellantis brands (Abarth, Alfa Romeo, Chrysler, Citroën, Dodge, DS, Fiat, Fiat Professional, Jeep, Lancia, Maserati, Opel, Peugeot, RAM and Vauxhall) in France, Italy, Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands, Poland and Portugal.
In 2021, the leasing business doubled and digital credit and leasing sales tripled. We also launched a subscription business in Spain, Germany and Norway (to be launched in our remaining countries in 2022-2023).
Moreover, we ran several cost reduction and income initiatives (pricing and funding costs) to compensate revenue lost during lockdowns.
To sustainably grow our business and contribute to the enhancement of the environment, we are developing new business solutions and partnerships to finance electric vehicles (we financed >113,000 fullyelectric vehicles in 2021), electric chargers, solar panels, green heating systems, etc. while promoting carbon offset services (available in all countries). Additionally, we are an active issuer in the green bond market, with 5 issuances in 2021.
In comparison with our pan-European competitors, our higher volumes and better efficiency (in absolute terms and trends) enabled us to maintain our leadership position and high profitability, thereby increasing our competitive advantage.
Thanks to all these initiatives, DCB secured its great potential to continue enhancing the business and growing the 19 million active customer base.
SCF was once again named Top Employer in Austria, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands and Poland recognizing its HR best practices. Additionally, Great Place to Work named SCF among the best 25 companies to work for in Italy, France and the UK.

Though pandemic restrictions affected commercial activity in early 2021 (mainly in Central Europe), new business recovered to precovid-19 levels in Q2 (driven by Germany and the Nordics).

The price of these transactions with other Group entities is the market rate plus a premium, which in liquidity terms, we support by immobilizing funds during the term of the transaction.
– Active management of interest rate risk with derivatives with high credit quality, high liquidity and low capital consumption in order to reduce the impact of interest rate shifts on net interest income.
– Strategic management of exposure to exchange rates in equity and dynamic on the countervalue of the country units’ annual results in euros.

Business performance Business in 2021 was marked by recovery in SCIB's core markets despite the pandemic upsurge and uncertainty caused by rising inflation and geopolitical tension. Against this backdrop, SCIB continued to offer clients tailored financing solutions, strategic advice and assistance with capital markets to meet their needs, and advice on their digital transformation and sustainability goals.
Each business's revenue performance (in constant euros) was as follows: • Global markets: revenue was 12% higher year-on-year. The markets business recorded strong revenue growth in 2021 underscored by sound management of the trading books and sales to clients whom we have continued to support with structured hedging products, especially in Spain and Portugal, Asia, Argentina, Brazil and Chile. Solid performance of interest rate and FX hedging products, fixed income, lending and equity derivatives.
In 2021, SCIB developed the first sustainable market products, such as the ESG Linked Derivatives, whose price is based on KPIs of Santander's corporate ESG programmes and our customers; and the first ESG Impact Derivatives, which help Santander run environmental projects with a portion of their proceeds. SCIB also issued structured notes and ESG deposits.
• GDF (Global Debt Financing): Santander continued to support clients in accessing liquidity sources. As a result, funding volumes spiked in the year and total income was 14% higher year-on-year. We shifted our strategy towards sustainable financing in the loan and bond markets.
In particular, we issued our first social project bond with Sacyr in Colombia plus the sustainable bonds of the Kingdom of Spain, Republic of Chile, the European Investment Bank and others.
We continued to be a global leader in structured finance. SCIB ranked number one in Latin America and Europe thanks to the large renewable projects we led.
We also began to engage in our clients' leveraged buy-outs on companies in Europe such as Burger King, Masmovil, Urbaser and the privatization of Aggreko.
• Global Transactional Banking (GTB): Total income was 1% higher than in 2020. Cash Management improved during the year as transactional banking continued to recover, with greater commercial activity in most of the division's core countries, offsetting the negative impact of low interest rates in some, though rises are expected in 2022.
Export & Agency Finance continues to provide financial and risk mitigation solutions for cross-border capex transactions in all markets. It benefits from the support of Export Credit Agencies (ECAs) and Multilateral Lending Agencies (MLAs) to serve our entire client base.
We were particularly active in green finance for environmental projects and in covid-19 impact mitigation programmes. We also maintained our market leadership with solid growth (especially in Europe).

In 2021, the Trade & Working Capital Solutions team enhanced its industry leadership. It closed large transactions with the development of new products and strategic asset allocation initiatives. Of note was the launch of the Inventory Finance product (which rounds off our working capital solutions proposition). To maintain our double-digit growth rate sustainably, we expanded our client base and developed tools that optimize the use of our balance sheet. In particular, we rolled out an alternative investment fund with Santander Asset Management for trade assets, and entered into an EUR 2 billion agreement with the EIB to expand our confirming programmes.

Markets +12% • Corporate Finance (CF): we saw significant revenue growth (+44% vs 2020) driven by an increase in mergers and acquisitions (M&A) and equity capital market (ECM) transactions.
In M&A, we focused on transactions for assets related to the energy transition and renewable electricity. In two green hydrogen-related transactions, we advised Plug Power in the creation of a joint venture with Renault and another with Acciona Energía. In renewable energies, we advised Canada's Northland Power and Italy's ENI on acquisitions in Spain.
In the technology, media and telecom (TMT) sector, we advised on digital infrastructure transactions. SCIB advised Telefónica in three sales of fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) companies worth more than USD 2.5 billion, which will help expand digital inclusion in Chile, Brazil and Colombia.
The infrastructure M&A market also had a good year. We carried out more than 15 global transactions. In particular, Platinum Equity acquired the Spanish environmental services group Urbaser and Goldman Sachs Infra sold the last package of the RCO highway in Mexico. As a result, SCIB was at the top of advisor rankings for Spain and Portugal and for Latin America.
ECM revenue spiked, strengthening our market leadership in Spain and Portugal, Brazil, Mexico and Poland. We led major transactions of the year, such as Acciona Energía's EUR 1.5 billion IPO in Spain (the largest in Europe's renewable energy industry), Universal Music Group's EUR 20 billion IPO (the largest spin-off ever) and EXI's IPO (the largest equity offering in Mexico since 2017).
We performed exceptionally well in Brazil. Our 28 transactions (16 IPOs and 12 primary share offerings), included Armac's BRL 1.5 billion IPO and Brisanet's BRL 1.4 billion IPO and Lojas Renner's BRL 4 billion follow-on public offering.
Results. 
Underlying attributable profit in 2021 increased 21% to EUR 2,167 million (20% of the Group's total operating areas). Excluding the exchange rate impact, growth was 26%, strongly backed by GDF and Markets. RoRWA was 2.23% (1,86% in 2020). By line: • Total income was 10% higher driven by net fee income (+16%) and gains on financial transactions (+9%).
• Administrative expenses and amortizations rose 15%, compared to 2020 due to investments in products and franchises under development. However, efficiency improved year-on-year and remained a benchmark in the sector (40%).
• Sharp improvement in loan-loss provisions compared to 2020, due to significant increases last year stemming from the widespread macroeconomic downturn caused by the covid-19 pandemic. Better-than-expected economic conditions at the beginning of 2021 led us to release provisions and improved the credit outlook for the customer portfolio, which had an impact on the level of provisions recorded during the year.

Strategy. 
Underlying attributable profit PagoNxt -EUR 253 Mn "After just over 12 months of existence, I'm thrilled to see the progress we've made to become a one-stop-shop that meets all payment needs for merchants, SMEs, corporates and consumers. We're investing in world-class technology and hiring top payments talent to continue to innovate and launch new products and services that will improve user experience"
Business performance Results. 
Accelerating commerce for merchants and for their connected ecosystem of customers and business partners, on the back of our cloud-native global payments platform, Santander's large-scale distribution capabilities and open market access. 
PagoNxt achieved significant growth across markets in 2021. In the last 12 months, Getnet's base of active merchants grew 6% and Total Payments Volume was 50% higher. 
PagoNxt's revenue is growing fast. It amounted to EUR 495 mn in 2021, 47% higher in H2 than in H1. 
Strategy PagoNxt aims to accelerate commerce for merchants and for their connected ecosystem of customers and business partners. Its strength lies in its digital commerce proposition for merchants and in its exposure to fast-growing markets, complemented by distinctive assets that are progressively connecting corporates and consumers. We are fulfilling our purpose with: • Our strong track record serving merchants through a digital commerce proposition. We serve merchants of different sizes according to their payment needs with a full suite of merchant service products, which include PoS payments, e-commerce and omnichannel, boasting local and cross-border coverage. We also offer value-added solutions that leverage our in-house product development and third-party providers.
• Our progressively integrated value proposition that leverages our shared cloud-native, data-driven global payments platform. PagoNxt's real-time, flexible and highly scalable technology platform is fully cloud- and API- based, and enterprise-ready. It ensures access to PagoNxt's latest features with simpler integration. We process and generate insights to help our customers and their businesses harness the full power of data and make data-driven decisions.
• Santander’s distribution network and open market capabilities. Our connection to Santander gives us privileged access to 153 million customers, plus proven distribution capabilities, that enable us to scale up faster and save acquisition costs.
To expand our global reach, we are leveraging synergies with Santander’s existing presence but also developing open market distribution capabilities outside its footprint.
• Reinforced adjacencies that deliver value to businesses and consumers. We are developing solutions to expand our breadth of payment services to cover the entire commerce network. In combining the cutting-edge platforms, One Trade and Ebury, PagoNxt is offering a complete portfolio to meet SMEs' and institutions' international trade needs and help them thrive across borders with a simple, secure solution to transfer money globally.
This is complemented by our Payments Hub's instant payment capabilities. In consumer, our Superdigital platform connects merchants with the underbanked and with low-income individuals across Latin America, providing them with a low cost-to-serve model and innovative offering.
Our full autonomy and clear governance ensure delivery speed, as we operate independently, with our own people, culture, technology and operations.

Business performance In late 2020, PagoNxt launched as a global payments platform to bring Santander's most innovative payment assets under one roof, build on the established Getnet franchise and achieve global leadership in the payments market.
Since inception, we have had several important achievements: • PagoNxt is now a standalone operation. Its talent, processes and corporate governance provide the necessary base for faster growth. It has autonomous decision-making processes and a diverse talent pool with a strong technological background, 60% of whom are technologists and payments experts. We are investing to expand our payments proposition, increase our scale and enter high growth markets.
• Getnet, our payment solution for merchants, increased its footprint and achieved significant growth in 2021. Its Total Payments Volume (TPV) grew 50% to EUR 116 billion and its active merchants totalled 1.2 million a 6% increase year-on-year.
In Latin America, Getnet continued to expand. It achieved TPV market share exceeding 15% TPV market share in Brazil and Mexico, and it also launched commercial operations in Chile and Uruguay. Getnet Brazil is now fully integrated within PagoNxt after the completion of its spin-off from Santander Brasil and subsequent listing on the B3, in São Paulo and on the Nasdaq. Likewise, Getnet Europe began operations in H2 as a pan-European acquirer after the integration of former Wirecard's technology, and consolidated its position in Spain with a 14% TPV market share.
• PagoNxt's global technology platform continued to enhance its capabilities and scale: – On the merchant side, our global platform added multiple new services including digital onboarding and PoS, alternative payment methods (APMs) and other payment schemes. We rolled it out in the EU, Argentina and Uruguay, and accelerated migration in other countries (e.g., 80% of transactions in Mexico have already been transferred).
– On the trade side, our One Trade value proposition expanded its international payments, FX and trade finance solutions for SMEs and institutions. It is already connected to eight countries, providing, for example, instant payments in BRL in Brazil.
– Our Payments Hub platform complements that proposition with its instant payments access to schemes in GBP and EUR.
– On the consumer side, our Superdigital global platform developed digital wallets and payments for the underbanked. It was rolled out in Argentina, ahead of an initial launch of friends & family in Colombia and Peru.

Responsible Corporate Economic and Risk management Contents banking governance financial review and compliance 5. Research, development and innovation (R&D&I)
Research, development and innovation activities Innovation and technological development are fundamental to Santander's strategy. We aim to focus on operational excellence and customer experience in response to fresh challenges that emanate from digital transformation.
Moreover, the information from our new technological platforms helps us better understand the customer journey and enable us to design a more accurate digital profile to generate more confidence and increase customer loyalty.
As well as competition from other banks, financial entities must watch out for new entrants to the financial system, whose use of new technology is both a differentiating factor and a competitive advantage.
Developing a sound strategic technology plan must provide: • greater capacity to adapt to customers’ needs (customized products and services, full availability, and excellent, secure service across all channels); • enhanced processes for Santander’s professionals to ensure greater reliability and productivity; and • proper risk management, supplying teams with the necessary infrastructures to help identify and assess all business-related, operational, reputational, regulatory and compliance risks.
As a global systemically important bank, Santander and its subsidiaries face increasing regulatory demands that impact system models and their underlying technology. Therefore they must make considerable additional investments to guarantee compliance and legal security.
As in previous years, the European Commission's 2021 EU Industrial R&D Investment Scoreboard (based on 2020 data) ranked our technological effort first among Spanish companies and our R&D investment second among global banks.
The equivalent investment in R&D&I to that considered in the ranking was EUR 1,325 million. See note 18 to the consolidated financial statements.
Technological strategy To meet business and customer needs, we must integrate new digital capabilities such as agile methodologies, public and private cloud-based products and core systems development. We must also broaden our data and technological capabilities (APIs - Application Programming Interface, artificial intelligence, robotics, blockchain, etc.).
Our technological strategy aligns with the three pillars of the Group's strategy: One Santander, PagoNxt and Digital Consumer Bank. Our technological pillars (cloud, agile, data, core evolution and deep tech skills), a flexible and common architecture and a global operating model, and better risk and associated cost management, help us achieve this.
To ensure the technology strategy is consistent in all the Group's entities, the Santander Architecture Review Board (SARB) holds monthly meetings that bring together the chief technology officers (CTOs) of the different units and businesses to actively participate in key architecture decision-making. The SARB oversees everything; the analysis of potential assets, the migration to the cloud, the review of data lake reference architectures and other measures. The use of a single technology stack and reference architectures are key to achieving Santander Common Architecture. Based on simplification, component recycling and the principle of composable architecture, the SARB also guarantees the use of technologies that matches the business of the future.
To implement our technological strategy we rely on internal regulation, the Group's commitment and experience in relations with our entities, and a governance model that articulates projects and initiatives that help crystallize it in all our markets.
The development of our technology and operations (T&O) model will help us cultivate new business, especially in terms of global products and digital services. Some 5,000 Santander Global Technology & Operations professionals in Spain, the UK, Portugal, Poland, the US, Mexico, Brazil and Chile are gradually incorporating the global product portfolio agreed on by the Group's entities, our global businesses and the T&O division, guaranteeing the not only quality of digital services and products, but also their security.
Technological infrastructure. 
Santander has a network of high-quality data centres (CPDs) interconnected by a redundant communications system. The CPDs are spread across strategic markets to support and develop our activity. They combine traditional information technology (IT) systems with the capabilities supplied by an on-premise private cloud, which, thanks to its swift adoption, enables integrated management of the business areas’ technology, accelerates digital transformation and allows us to save costs significantly.
Santander has migrated more than 75% of its technology infrastructure to the cloud and expects to complete the roll-out by 2023. Our cloud strategy enables us to improve processes, innovate swiftly and improve service quality. Our Local Cloud Centres of Excellence (local CCoEs), which the Global CCoE coordinates, guarantee consistent and rigorous cloud adoption across our entities. This minimizes risks in accordance with our Public Cloud policy. The process will also help fulfil Santander's responsible banking goals as.

Cybersecurity is one of Santander’s main priorities and a crucial element in supporting our purpose of helping people and businesses prosper, as well as offering excellent digital services to our customers.
The new cyber services and capabilities created during the 3-year Cybersecurity Transformation Plan completed in 2020 have moved to business as usual (BAU) operations in line with the Group’s Cybersecurity Framework. It enabled us to set the organizational foundations and governance for cyber security globally; establish global cybersecurity services in the Group; strengthen defences according to existing best practices and latest technology tools; and drive a security-aware culture among employees and clients. During the transformation, Santander opened a Global Cybersecurity Centre in Madrid which proactively identifies, monitors and responds to cyber threats 24/7 to protect all Group entities, systems and customers.
At the same time, as cyber threats and attack techniques become more sophisticated, we must continuously evolve our cyber defences. In 2021, we established these key strategic cyber security pillars and initiatives to help us develop our cyber defences against emerging threats and technologies: • Level the playing field: The current threat landscape is increasingly challenging and new weaknesses, techniques and procedures are reported on a daily basis. Deterrence, deception and automation techniques are crucial to make attacks more difficult; • Defend the (hyper-connected) "Bank of the Future": Banks'platforms, cloud and supply chains are increasingly hyperconnected and interdependent. Cybersecurity teams have been working on implementing new defence paradigms such as “Zero Trust” and other innovative solutions; and • Generate value and trust: Helping customers stay safe online is key to continue building trust and helping everyone prosper in the digital world. Santander promoted public-private partnerships and collaborations to tackle cybercrime to protect customers and society as a whole. For Santander this has translated into several initiatives in 2021, detailed in section 'Acting responsibly towards customers' of the Responsible banking chapter.
Internal and external audits of information systems occur periodically. The Group identifies IT assets, systems and information (including those in third parties), and regularly reviews the relevant risks and levels of protection to proactively discover and remedy any weakness through frequent security testing such as vulnerability scanning, penetration testing and red team exercises that simulate real cyber-attack scenarios.
Santander also actively participates in various coordinated cyberexercises in collaboration with public and private organizations. In 2021, Santander placed first and third against 29 teams in the “Capture the Flag” exercise the SANS Institute in Spain had organized. We also placed seventh out of 200 teams from 48 countries in the World Economic Forum's Cyberpolygon exercise.
In addition to regular testing and reviews, independent certification authorities such as the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 27001 and the Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE) 18 certify our critical cyber security services.
For more details on the different on how we measure, monitor and control cybersecurity risks and their respective mitigation plans, see section 6.2 'Operational risk management' of the Risk management and compliance chapter.
Digitalization and fintech ecosystem. 
To make headway in our digital transformation, in addition to the technological strategy, infrastructure development and cybersecurity initiatives, we created PagoNxt in 2020. This new brand enables us to accelerate business for merchants and enhance their ecosystem connecting customers and business partners, through our cloudnative, data-driven global payments platform, coupled with Santander's large-scale distribution and proven capabilities to provide access to the open market. Further details are given in section 4 'Financial information by segment' in this chapter.
Moreover, Santander combined Santander Consumer Finance's scale and leading position in Europe with Openbank's platform. Openbank's technology (digital banking API, with a Banking as a Service model) and data management capabilities drive growth by offering new services and operational improvements.
For more details about our digital and innovative products and services for individuals and corporates, as well as references to cybersecurity policies, see section 2 ‘Inclusive and sustainable growth’ in the Responsible banking chapter.

Responsible Corporate Economic and Risk management Contents banking governance financial review and compliance 7. Trend information 2022. 
This director’s report contains certain prospective information on the directors’ plans, forecasts and estimates, based on what they consider to be reasonable assumptions.
Readers of this report should take into account that such prospective information must not be considered a guarantee of our future performance. As the plans, forecasts and estimates are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, our future performance may not match initial expectations. These risks and uncertainties are described in the Risk management chapter of this report and in note 53 of the consolidated financial statements.
The economic outlook for 2022 is subject to considerable uncertainty owing to the spread of new covid-19 variants in Europe and the US in the final stretch of 2021, the risk they will spread to other regions and doubts about the transience of the 2021 inflation upturn.
The impact of the omicron variant and any future variants or outbreaks on activity is difficult to gauge and will largely depend on the resulting pressure on hospital capacity, which is not easy to foresee given the varying contagiousness and virulence of each covid-19 variant. Higher inflation will have an adverse effect on consumption and on financial conditions.
Our baseline scenario assumes that the measures to contain the virus will have a moderate effect on business activity, inflation gradually subsides but remains above the target for the year, and, with some exceptions, the withdrawal of monetary stimulus will be very gradual. Among the bank's most relevant economies, growth in Europe and the US is expected to stay strong growth, but it may be more imbalanced in Latin America.
The macroeconomic forecast for 2022 by country/region is as follows:
Eurozone Although growth recorded in 2021 may be slightly more hesitant at the start of 2022, it is expected to continue into the year, underpinned by continued expansionary financial conditions, loose fiscal policy, a greater weight of Next Generation EU funds, a downturn in the pandemic and a gradual decline in inflation.
In several countries, upcoming elections and the reforms and credibility of countries' fiscal consolidation plans will be important in a year in which the restoration of the Stability and Growth Pact may be announced and monetary and prudential measures against the pandemic will be gradually withdrawn.
Spain In Europe, the deployment of EU funds (particularly crucial for Spain), the potential improvement in international tourism, the expected further recovery in household consumption and the anticipated reactivation of home construction indicate remarkable growth that could push GDP close to pre-pandemic levels.
The success of ongoing structural reforms (partly related to EU funds) will be fundamental in the short- and medium-term.
United Kingdom A favourable outlook points to another year of strong recovery. The main unknown is the UK's ability to adapt to Brexit and the implications it will have for supply (mainly in the labour market which has shown some tension due to labour shortages in some segments).
Overall, financial conditions are expected to remain expansionary and inflation is projected to fall, which will boost confidence and activity as long as the spread of covid-19 reduces.
Portugal The economy is forecast to grow above pre-pandemic levels as early as 2022, thanks to consumption growth (backed by accumulated savings), Next Generation EU funds and the hope of an upturn in tourism. The labour market is already at pre-pandemic employment levels, but is suffering from worker shortages, as the job vacancy rate suggests that unemployment will fall even further, to around 6%. The commitment to putting public accounts in order will remain a priority.
Poland GDP growth was surprisingly positive in 2021 and it seems as though the economy is starting 2022 strongly. That could keep annual GDP growth close to 5%. Positive outlooks for the highly competitive and diversified manufacturing and export sector (which will benefit from ongoing positive growth abroad). While high inflation has not affected corporate profit margins, it did lead to a 165 bp rise in interest rates in Q4'21 to 1.75%, a trend that is expected to continue.

Responsible Corporate Economic and Risk management Contents banking governance financial review and compliance. 
United States The US economy is forecasted to grow around 4% in 2022 supported by pick ups in activity, wealth-backed private consumption and inventory rebuilding. However, the withdrawal of fiscal and monetary stimulus and effects of potential further covid-19 waves will have a negative impact. Inflation will start the year suffering from supply-side strains; however it is expected to moderate but at high rates. The Federal Reserve (Fed) is expected to end tapering in March and begin to raise interest rates.
Mexico Mexico's outlook is positive in light of the dynamism in the US, the credibility of monetary and fiscal policies and expected easing of the recent bottlenecks. The Fed's interest rate hike is not expected to have a major influence on the central bank's plans to continue raising rates given that it has already raised them significantly.
Brazil Inflation, the sharp tightening of financial conditions and the uncertainty generated by the presidential elections are expected to have a strong impact on business in 2022. Once political uncertainty subsides, economic recovery may be stronger.
Chile Following the strong economic expansion in 2021, growth is expected to be subdued in 2022, due to the withdrawal of fiscal stimulus and the tighter monetary policy, amid lower inflation than in the previous year but still higher than the central bank's target.
Argentina Argentina's economy is expected to grow moderately in 2022, in light of its economic stabilization programme with the International Monetary Fund (agreed in the first quarter of 2022), to refinance its debt maturities with the organization.
à Financial markets. 
Inflationary pressures, less fiscal and, especially, monetary support, and geopolitical risk, mean more vulnerable financial markets in 2022.
Our expectation of inflation moderating gradually throughout the year and slower but above potential economic growth after a strong post-covid-19 recovery will help equities adjust to the transition to monetary policy normalization. However, in light of the gap between real interest rates and inflation expectations at maximum levels and given the current high stock prices, moments of instability could befall the stock markets during this adjustment.
We expect the Fed to end its net purchase programme in March 2022, potentially opening the door to rate hikes. The more laggard ECB will exhaust its pandemic programme before considering raising the deposit rate. The landscape suggests bond yields may rebound (albeit moderately in any case), although the ECB's gradual withdrawal could put pressure on peripheral spreads. The US dollar will likely remain strong against the euro in the short term, but a gradual appreciation of the euro is possible in the medium term as the US-Europe growth differential narrows and the US is encumbered by fiscal and trade deficits.
The risks that emerged in Latin America in the second half of 2021 fuel uncertainty regarding 2022. At the domestic level, there are two main obstacles: increased concerns that public finances in the Latin American countries that increased debt the most to cope with the pandemic will become unsustainable amid rising interest rates; and on the political front, Brazil's presidential elections may spur market volatility.
The banking environment will be conditioned by inflation and central banks' response, both in mature and emerging countries. In general, a gradual normalization of monetary policy would not negative for business; but central banks must get the pace and communication of their measures right.
The tightening of monetary policy may be followed by the withdrawal of liquidity support measures, but gradually, allowing banks to adjust to the new conditions. Lastly, the private sector remains vulnerable to an economic downturn, especially in those sectors most affected by social distancing and mobility measures. Even so, at the moment most institutions have a solvency position sound enough to cope, as demonstrated by several stress tests conducted on the main banking systems.
In addition to the economic environment, banks must deal with faster business digitalization while understanding and managing climate change risks.

Responsible Corporate Economic and Risk management Contents banking governance financial review and compliance àFinancial regulation. 
In 2022, we expect sustainability and digitalization will remain at the top of the regulatory agenda, alongside prudential and financial matters.
Prudential. Talks about implementing the Basel III reforms in Europe will take centre stage. The most important matters include the treatment of operational risk, the output floor (a measure that sets a lower limit on risk-weighted assets that banks calculate when using their internal models) and EU-specific scenarios relating to SME and infrastructure support. The new rules will take effect on 1 January 2025, regardless of their approval date.
The authorities will continue to assess the impact of the crisis and the interaction of regulatory framework in matters such as current capital buffers (which banks have not used despite supervisors’ recommendations). The European Commission is expected to review the macroprudential framework before the year is out. The Basel Committee will continue to issue proposals on the prudential treatment of financial entities’ cryptoasset exposures.
Finance: In 2022, the EU will commence a third revision of the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) aiming to improve the application of the framework, eliminate incentives to bail out failing banks with public money and ensure the framework is suitable for small and medium-sized banks.
A first revision of the Deposit Guarantee Schemes Directive (DGSD) is planned. Negotiations on the creation of a common European deposit guarantee fund (European Deposit Insurance Scheme – EDIS) will also continue.
Sustainability: To enhance the green taxonomy, the European Commission will work on drafting the four remaining environmental objectives and determining one taxonomy for activities that harm the environment and another for activities with social aims. Further work will be done on setting European and international sustainable reporting standards and on finalizing details of the ESG information to be included in the Pillar 3 report from 2023.
The legislative proposal on sustainable corporate governance to help companies introduce ESG objectives into their strategies will be published. Progress will be made in with sustainability labels and standards linked to the Taxonomy, such as the European Green Bond Standard (EGBS). The Basel Committee will continue the work it started in 2021 on recommendations for the management and supervision of sustainability-related risks.
Digitalization: The Digital Markets Act (DMA) could possibly be passed in Q1. It would prove a turning point in the EU’s digital strategy by setting criteria for considering a large online platform a “gatekeeper” as well as obligations that ensure a fairer environment where all businesses could market their services.
The authorities acknowledge that data will be at the centre of the digital transformation. Further talks are expected on a regulatory framework for data sharing (Data Act). Debates will intensify on socalled “open finance”, which considers the possibility that banks (and also insurers and asset managers) may have to share more data than the Payment Services Directive (PSD2) requires.
While talks on reforming PSD2 will begin, the European Commission could issue a proposal on instant cross-border payments.
Technological innovation: In 2022, talks about the Commission's 2019 regulatory proposals to strengthen the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) and regulate markets in cryptoassets (MiCA) will continue. Those could be passed during the year. Legislative procedures will continue to pass those submitted in 2021 to regulate the use of artificial intelligence and create a European digital identity (eIDAs2) which could be used to access financial services, for example.
The ECB will continue its analysis of the digital euro. In 2021, it began a two-year study into the feasibility of issuing a digital euro. Almost all of the world's central banks are examining digital currencies.
Retail banking: Several initiatives underway are seeking to boost consumer protection and adapt laws to the digital landscape. Legislators are expected to approve proposed reforms of the Consumer Credit Directive and the Mortgage Credit Directive.
The key obligations that will apply from 2022 fall under the Taxonomy Regulation on environmentally sustainable activities), including banks' disclosure of the proportion of eligible assets held on their balance sheets.

Responsible Corporate Economic and Risk management Contents banking governance financial review and compliance 8. Alternative performance measures (APMs)
In addition to the financial information prepared under IFRS, this consolidated directors’ report contains financial measures that constitute alternative performance measures (APMs) to comply with the guidelines on alternative performance measures issued by the European Securities and Markets Authority on 5 October 2015 and non-IFRS measures.
The financial measures contained in this consolidated directors’ report that qualify as APMs and non-IFRS measures have been calculated using our financial information but are not defined or detailed in the applicable financial information framework or under IFRS and have neither been audited nor reviewed by our auditors.
We use these APMs and non-IFRS measures when planning, monitoring and evaluating our performance. We consider these APMs and non-IFRS financial measures to be useful metrics for management and investors to facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period. While we believe that these APMs and non-IFRS financial measures are useful in evaluating our business, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant as a substitute of IFRS measures. In addition, the way in which Santander defines and calculates these APMs and non-IFRS measures may differ from the calculations used by other companies with similar measures and, therefore, may not be comparable.
The APMs and non-IFRS measures we use in this document can be categorized as follows:
Underlying results. 
In addition to IFRS results measures, we present some results measures which are non-IFRS measures and which we refer to as underlying measures. These underlying measures allow, in our view, a better year-on-year comparability as they exclude items outside the ordinary course performance of business which are grouped in the non-IFRS line net capital gains and provisions and are further detailed at the end of section 3.2 'Results' of this chapter.
In addition, the results by business areas in section 4 'Financial information by segment' are presented only on an underlying basis in accordance with IFRS 8. The use of this information by the Group’s Governance bodies and reconciled on an aggregate basis to our IFRS consolidated results can be found in note 51.c to our consolidated financial statements.

Profitability and efficiency ratios. 
The purpose of the profitability and efficiency ratios is to measure the ratio of profit to capital, to tangible capital, to assets and to risk weighted assets, while the efficiency ratio measures how much general administrative expenses (personnel and other) and amortization costs are needed to generate revenue.
The goodwill adjustments have been removed from the RoTE numerator as, since they are not considered in the denominator, we believe this calculation is more correct.
Ratio. 
RoE (Return on Equity)
Underlying RoE. 
RoTE (Return on Tangible Equity)
Formula. 
Profit attributable to the parent. 
Average stockholders’ equity A (excl. minority interests)
Underlying profit attributable to the parent. 
Average stockholders’ equity A (excl. minority interests)
Profit attributable to the parent B. 
Average stockholders’ equity A (excl. minority interests)
Relevance of the metric. 
This ratio measures the return that shareholders obtain on the funds invested in the bank and as such measures the bank’s ability to pay shareholders.
This ratio measures the return that shareholders obtain on the funds invested in the bank excluding results from operations outside the ordinary course of business.
This is a very common indicator, used to evaluate the profitability of the company as a percentage of a its tangible equity. It’s measured as the return that shareholders receive as a percentage of the funds invested in the bank less intangible assets.
Underlying RoTE. 
RoA (Return on Assets)
Underlying profit attributable to the parent. 
Average stockholders’ equity A (excl. minority interests) - intangible assets. 
Consolidated profit. 
Average total assets. 
This indicator measures the profitability of the tangible equity of a company arising from ordinary activities, i.e. excluding results from operations outside the ordinary course of business.
This metric measures the profitability of a company as a percentage of its total assets. It is an indicator that reflects the efficiency of the bank’s total assets in generating profit over a given period.
Underlying RoA Underlying consolidated profit. 
Average total assets. 
This metric measures the profitability of a company as a percentage of its total assets excluding results from operations outside the ordinary course of business. It is an indicator that reflects the efficiency of the bank’s total assets in generating profit over a given period.
RoRWA (Return on Risk-Weighted Assets)
Consolidated profit. 
Average risk-weighted assets. 
The return adjusted for risk is a derivative of the RoA metric. The difference is that RoRWA measures profit in relation to the Group’s risk-weighted assets.
Underlying RoRWA. 
RoRAC (Return on Risk-Adjusted Capital)
Economic Value Added. 
Efficiency (Cost-to-income)
Underlying consolidated profit. 
Average risk weighted assets. 
Underlying consolidated profit. 
Average economic capital. 
Underlying consolidated profit – (average economic capital x cost of capital)
Operating expenses C. 
Total income. 
This relates the underlying consolidated profit (excluding results from operations outside the ordinary course of business) to the Group’s risk weighted assets.
This is the return on economic capital required internally (necessary to support all risks inherent in our activity).
Economic value added is the profit generated in excess of the cost of economic capital employed. This measures risk adjusted returns in absolute terms, complementing the RoRAC approach.
One of the most commonly used indicators when comparing productivity of different financial entities. It measures the amount of resources used to generate the bank’s operating income.
A. Stockholders’ equity = Capital and Reserves + Accumulated other comprehensive income + Profit attributable to the parent + Dividends. B. Excluding the adjustment to the valuation of goodwill. C. Operating expenses = Administrative expenses + amortizations.

Other indicators. 
The market capitalization indicator provides information on the volume of tangible equity per share. The loan-to-deposit ratio (LTD) identifies the relationship between net customer loans and advances and customer deposits, assessing the proportion of loans and advances granted by the Group that are funded by customer deposits.
The Group also uses gross customer loan magnitudes excluding reverse repurchase agreements (repos) and customer deposits excluding repos. In order to analyse the evolution of the traditional commercial banking business of granting loans and capturing deposits, repos and reverse repos are excluded, as they are mainly treasury business products and highly volatile.

TNAV per share (Tangible net asset value per share)
Tangible book value A. 
Number of shares excluding treasury stock. 
This is a very commonly used ratio used to measure the company’s accounting value per share having deducted the intangible assets. It is useful in evaluating the amount each shareholder would receive if the company were to enter into liquidation and had to sell all the company’s tangible assets.

Impact of exchange rate movements on profit and loss accounts. 
The Group presents, at both the Group level as well as the business unit level, the real changes in the income statement as well as the changes excluding the exchange rate effect, as it considers the latter facilitates analysis, since it enables businesses movements to be identified without taking into account the impact of converting each local currency into euros.
Said variations, excluding the impact of exchange rate movements, are calculated by converting P&L lines for the different business units comprising the Group into our presentation currency, the euro, applying the average exchange rate for 2021 to all periods contemplated in the analysis. The table below shows the average exchange rates of the main currencies in which the Group operates.
Impact of exchange rate movements on the balance sheet. 
The Group presents, at both the Group level as well as the business unit level, the real changes in the balance sheet as well as the changes excluding the exchange rate effect for loans and advances to customers excluding reverse repos and customer funds (which comprise deposits and mutual funds) excluding repos. As with the income statement, the reason is to facilitate analysis by isolating the changes in the balance sheet that are not caused by converting each local currency into euros.
These changes excluding the impact of exchange rate movements are calculated by converting loans and advances to customers excluding reverse repos and customer funds excluding repos, into our presentation currency, the euro, applying the closing exchange rate on the last working day of 2021 to all periods contemplated in the analysis. The table below shows the period-end exchange rates of the main currencies in which the Group operates.
Exchange rates: 1 euro/currency parity. 
Impact of inflation on operating expenses. 
Santander presents, for both the Group and the business units included in the primary segments, the changes in operating expenses, as well as the changes excluding the exchange rate effect, and the changes of the latter excluding the effect of average inflation in 2021. The reason is that the two latter facilitate analysis for management purposes.
Inflation is calculated as the arithmetic average of the last twelve months for each country and, for the regions, as the weighted average of each country comprising the region's inflation rate, weighed by each country's operating expenses in the region. The table below shows the average inflation rates calculated as indicated for each of the regions and countries.

Responsible Corporate Economic and Risk management Contents banking governance financial review and compliance 1.3 Santander's top and emerging risks. 
For forward-looking management and strict control, we regularly measure top and emerging risks under various stress scenarios. We detect, analyse and monitor major internal and external threats that could affect our strategic plan and compromise our profitability and solvency. Top and emerging risks could lead to deviations from our targets, as (by definition) their potential impact is not included in current plans. Still, management measures can mitigate impact severity.
In 2021, the covid pandemic and vaccine rollouts (especially in OECD countries, where they have prompted faster economic recovery than expected) still affected our top risks identification process. The risk of new virus variants remains under close observation, particularly in geographies where vaccination rates are low.
Grupo Santander is monitoring and adopting measures to mitigate strategic risks, such as:
A macroeconomic scenario in which recovery is restrained: Ongoing inflation in the US and Europe over recent months and signs of some economic indicators' slowdown have cast doubts about global economic recovery. Extreme scenarios even suggest the return of stagflation.
Following lockdowns, global manufacturing and services have not been able to keep up with increasing demand and changing consumption patterns prompted by covid. Global supply chains have not yet recovered their full capacity, which was diminished by pandemic restrictions. Examples of this are the maritime shipping woes and the semi-conductor shortage that is especially affecting the auto industry.
Food and commodity prices are on the rise, and many markets (including the US and the UK) are seeing labour shortages. Amid the inflationary tension (which central banks will have to tackle), fiscal and monetary stimulus measures to reverse the economic slowdown spurred by the pandemic which are gradually being reduced. There is the risk that economic recovery will be affected by these ongoing supply shocks, leading to higher, more structural inflation. Furthermore, if job market instability pushes inflation forecasts above targets, due to the so called "second-round effects", the pressure for tighter monetary policies will be greater.
Our balanced diversification between mature and developing markets and our wide range of products leave us more resilient to macroeconomic threats. We also managed to reduce the potential severity of these risks through mitigating measures we took at the onset of the pandemic and adapted throughout 2021. They include: • robust risk policies and processes and proactive management, which kept our risk profile within the parameters set out in our risk appetite statement; • our recoveries and collections teams’ full capacity after adapting to the new environment through a Group-wide preparedness plan initiated in 2020 and finalized in 2021; • continuous monitoring of the social and political situation regarding countries and industries where we have considerable exposure, and adjustments of our limits and positions according to our risk appetite; and • regular reviews of our risk profile and commercial, market and macroeconomic dynamics, and new action plans to remain on track with established plans.
Growing regulatory pressure In light of our international footprint and status as a global systemically important bank, we are subject to substantial capital requirements that could increase owing to new regulation or to a review by the supervisor of the existing criteria. This could reduce our profitability and return on capital while raising our cost of funding. In the coming years, banks must implement capital and leveraging requirements in accordance with Basel III reforms, aimed to enhance the comparability of capital ratios at the industry level.
Key mitigation measures: • Continued enhancement of our models and multiple initiatives on each risk factor to optimize capital.
• Participation in all forums to debate and work with banking associations, regulators and supervisors on new regulation and requirements.
• Appropriate capital planning that allows us to absorb new regulation impacts preventing them from affecting our solvency levels.
Cyber risk in a digital business model Cybersecurity threats are increasing rapidly in terms of frequency, sophistication and impact. Ransomware and data breaches continued to dominate the external threat landscape during 2021. Additionally, new vulnerabilities that can be rapidly exploited are also on the rise.
As cyber threats continue to grow and new attack techniques are developed, continuous evolution of cyber defences is essential. Cybersecurity initiatives, described on the Cyber risk paragraph on section 6.2 'Operational risk management', are helping Grupo Santander to evolve its defences in line with emerging threats and technologies.
The increase in digital transactions and the expansion of remote working schemes seen in recent times can also have an effect on cyber risks and threats. These are the measures Grupo Santander has taken to combat them: • We tightened controls (e.g., patching, browsing control, data protection and remote connections from the call centre), anticipating the worst scenarios in order to create a "defence in depth" to prevent, detect, react and recover.
• We standardized and continued to bolster existing defences through agile, sustainable and risk-driven management.
Risk in the execution of our transformational projects. 
In the new digital environment driven by covid-19, growing competition between existing companies and new players is causing banks to rethink their business models, customer experience and market demands, spurring faster digitalization. Regulation plays a fundamental role and may give rise to asymmetries between new and traditional competitors, and between markets.
To adapt, Grupo Santander is executing a transformation plan that is complex owing to the number of countries, systems and regulation it. 
Annual report 2021 437


 

 

Responsible Corporate Economic and Risk management Contents banking governance financial review and compliance involves. If we fail to execute these key strategic projects, it could damage our business plan and worsen efficiency as well as regulatory expectations.
Key mitigation measures: • Continuing to make progress in digitalization to make the bank an open financial services platform. This has been vital in the new environment. Our agreements and joint ventures have been playing a fundamental role in our transformation.
• Sharing best practices and commercial solutions in order to continue to embed a culture of fast experimentation in Grupo Santander.
• Establish a strategic project management office with robust governance to monitor and report to the risk control and strategy committees on strategic projects.
• We carefully measure and monitor risks stemming from inadequate project execution. Projects must be closely overseen by specific departments.
Inclusion of climate-related risks within risk management Climate-related risks have become a priority for broader society. Governments, international organizations, regulators and supervisors continue to develop initiatives to comprehend the magnitude of this risk, with stricter transparency and market disclosure requirements in regard to climate-related risks to banks’ profitability, resilience and business strategies.
We split climate-related risk into two categories: (1) risks from the transition to a low-carbon economy and (2) risks from the physical effects of climate change. To identify and respond to them properly, proactive management is key.
In 2022, European banks will undergo their first-ever climate-related stress test to measure the Eurosystem’s balance sheet exposure to climate-related risk. Furthermore, as the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP) gradually includes environmental risks, they could eventually have an effect on regulatory capital.
Key mitigation measures: • Direct participation of senior managers to support Grupo Santander’s strategic objectives, in accordance with our established governance.
For more details on those objectives, see section 10. 'Climate and environmental risk' in this chapter.
• Climate-related project, with Responsible Banking, Corporate & Investment Banking (CIB) and Risks at the helm, to develop risk measurement approaches, climate-related metrics, strategies, new policies and frameworks; set out a robust risk appetite statement; and design green products to satisfy the growing demand. Stronger internal resources and capabilities to meet increasing requirements.
• Financing for renewable energy and smart infrastructure to aid customers’ transition to reducing their own carbon emissions. Support for inclusive and sustainable growth in consideration of risks and opportunities.
• Active role in international forums and working groups to promote the energy transition programme, including the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative's (UNEP FI) pilot programme to develop scenarios, models and metrics to measure climate-related risks and opportunities in the future.
As part of our risk identification process, we also defined other events, which could affect our strategy and transformation plan in the longer-term, such as significant shifts in market tendencies and the business environment; consumer behaviour; geopolitics; political fragmentation; social and demographic changes; asymmetric access to natural resources; extended use of crypto assets; and potential legal loopholes. We conducted Board Risk Strategy sessions to discuss with board members new and fast emerging key trends.

Responsible Corporate Economic and Risk management Contents banking governance financial review and compliance 2. Risk management and control model. 
Our risk management and control model is underpinned by common principles, a strong risk culture, a solid governance structure and advanced risk management processes and tools 2.1 Risk principles and culture. 
Our risk principles below are compulsory. They comply with regulatory requirements and are inspired by best market practices: 1. All employees are risk managers who must understand the risks associated with their functions and not assume risks with an impact that exceeds the Group’s risk appetite or is unknown.
2. Involvement of senior managers, with consistent risk management and control through their conduct, actions and communications, as well as oversight of our risk culture and make sure we maintain our risk profile within the defined risk appetite.
3. Independent risk management and control functions, according to our three lines of defence model, described in detail under section 2.3 'Risk and Compliance governance' of this chapter.
4. A forward-looking, comprehensive approach to risk management and control for all businesses and risk types.
5. Complete and timely information to identify, assess, manage and disclose risks to the appropriate level.
Grupo Santander’s holistic control structure stands on these principles and includes strategic tools and processes set out in the risk appetite statement, such as annual and budget planning, scenario analysis, the risk reporting structure and risk identification and assessment.
Risk culture - Risk Pro Santander has a strong risk culture called Risk Pro (or I AM RISK in the UK and the US), based on the principle that all employees are risk managers. Risk Pro is a pillar of 'The Santander Way' group culture and considers all risks to promote socially responsible management and long-term sustainability.
For more details, see the section 'Risk pro: our risk culture' in the Responsible Banking chapter.
2.2 Risk factors. 
Grupo Santander's risks categorization ensures effective risk management, control and reporting. Our risk framework distinguishes these risk types:
Credit risk relates to financial loss arising from the default 1 or credit quality deterioration of a customer or counterparty, to which Santander has directly financed or assumed a contractual obligation.
Market risk results of loss and detriment to profits or 2 capital stemming from movements in interest rates, exchange rates, stock and commodity prices and its potential impact on capital requirements.
Liquidity risk occurs if liquid financial resources are 3 insufficient or too costly to obtain in order to meet liabilities when they fall due.
Structural risk is the risk that market movements or 4 balance sheet behaviour will change the value or profit generation of assets or liabilities in the banking book. It covers insurance and pension risks, as well as the risk that Santander will not have sufficient capital (in terms of quantity or quality) to meet internal business targets, regulatory requirements or market expectations.
Operational risk is the possibility of losses due to 5 shortcomings and failures relating to processes, employees and internal systems, even as a result of external events. It includes legal, regulatory compliance and conduct risks.
Financial crime risk is the risk of loss due to criminal or 6 illegal activity involving Santander’s resources, products and services. Such activity includes money laundering, terrorism financing, violation of international sanctions, corruption, bribery and tax evasion.
Model risk involves potential losses due to inaccurate 7 forecasting or from a model being implemented or misused that can result in poor decision-making.
Reputational risk is the risk of current or potential negative 8 economic impact due to damage to the bank’s reputation among employees, customers, shareholders, investors and broader society.
Strategic risk relates to losses due to strategic decisions or 9 their poor implementation that affect our core stakeholders’ medium-to-long-term interests or to an inability to adapt to a changing environment.

Responsible Corporate Economic and Risk management Contents banking governance financial review and compliance. 
Environmental and climate-related risk drivers are considered as factors that could impact the existing risks in the medium-to-longterm.
These elements include, on the one hand, those derived from the physical effects of climate change, generated by one-off events as well as by chronic changes in the environment and, on the other hand, those derived from the process of transition to a development model with lower emissions, including changes on legislation, technology or economic agents' behaviour.
2.3 Risk and Compliance governance. 
Grupo Santander´s robust risk and compliance governance structure allows us to conduct effective oversight in line with our risk appetite. It stands on three lines of defence, a structure of committees and strong Group-subsidiary relations, guided by our risk culture, Risk Pro.
Lines of defence Our model of three lines of defence effectively manages and controls risks: – First line: formed by businesses and functions that take or originate exposure to risk, it recognizes, measures, controls, monitors and reports on risks according to internal risk management regulation. Risk origination must be consistent with the approved risk appetite and related limits.
– Second line: formed by the Risk and Compliance and Conduct functions, it independently oversees and challenges the first line’s risk management. Its duties include ensuring that risks are managed according to the risk appetite defined by senior management and strengthening our risk culture throughout Grupo Santander.
– Third line: the Internal Audit function, which is independent to ensure the board of directors and senior managers with highquality and efficient internal controls, governance and risk management systems, helping to safeguard our value, solvency and reputation.
The Risk, Compliance & Conduct and Internal Audit functions are separate and independent. Each has direct access to the board of directors and its committees.
Risk and Compliance committees' structure The board of directors is ultimately responsible for risk and compliance management and control. It revises and approves the bank's risk frameworks and appetite, while promoting a strong risk culture across the Group. The board relies on its risk supervision, regulation and compliance committee for risk control and on the group’s executive committee for risk approval.
For more details, see section 4.8 ‘Risk supervision, regulation and compliance committee activities in 2021’ of the chapter on Corporate governance.
The Group chief risk officer (Group CRO), who decides risk strategy and promotes proper risk culture, is in charge of overseeing all risks and challenging and advising business lines on risk management.
The Group chief compliance officer (Group CCO), who decides compliance and conduct strategy, is in charge of controlling the risks within their purview and must provide the Group CRO with a complete overview on the situation of risks being monitored.
Both the Group CRO and the Group CCO have direct access and report to the risk supervision, regulation and compliance committee and the board of directors.
Risk governance keeps risk control and risk-taking lines separate:
Board of directors. 
Risk Risk management control.

The executive risk, risk control and compliance and conduct committees (described below) are executive committees and have been delegated powers by the board.
Functions: Manages risks according to the powers it has been delegated by the board. It is authorized to approve, alter or scale significant models as well as any measures or transactions that may pose substantial risk to Grupo Santander. It makes the highest-level risk decisions according to the group’s risk appetite.
Chair: CEO. 
Composition: Appointed executive directors and other senior managers, representing the risk, finance and compliance and conduct functions. The Group CRO reserves the right to veto the committee’s decisions.
Executive risk committee (ERC) Risk control committee (RCC) Compliance and conduct committee. 
Controls and provides a holistic overview of risks. It makes sure business lines are managed according to risk appetite. It also identifies, monitors and assesses the impact of existing and emerging risks on Santander's risk profile.
Group CRO. 
Senior managers from the risk, compliance & conduct, finance, accounting and management control functions. From time to time, each CRO from subsidiaries attend to report on their respective risk profiles.
The committee monitors and reviews compliance and conduct risk management. It also oversees corrective measures for new risks and risks detected among management-related deficiencies.
Group CCO. 
Senior managers representing the compliance & conduct, risk, accounting and management control functions. The chair reserves the right to veto the committee’s decisions.
Meetings: Weekly Monthly Monthly. 
Forums: • Model approval forum • Risk proposal forum • Forum on market, structural, liquidity and capital risk control • Credit risk control forum • Corporate product governance forum • Financial crime prevention forum • Provisions forum • Reputational risk forum. 
In addition, for each risk factor there are forums and regular meetings to manage and control the risks within their purview. Executive committees also delegate part of their duties to subordinate forums.
Their responsibilities include: • reporting to the Group CRO, the Group CCO, the risk control committee and the compliance and conduct committee on risk management according to risk appetite; • monitoring and ensuring proper management of each risk factor; and • overseeing measures to comply with supervisors and auditors' expectations.
In order to establish an adequate control environment for the management of each risk factors, the Risk and Compliance and Conduct functions have effective internal regulation to create the right environment to manage and control all risks.
Grupo Santander can also dictate new governance measures for special situations. For the Brexit transition process, it set up separate steering committees and working groups with Santander UK. Also, to cope with the covid crisis, it created special situation forums, in which close coordination with subsidiaries, local contingency plan activation (including scenario analysis) enhanced allocated resources and governance to ensure the efficiency of the measures.
The Group’s relationship with its subsidiaries. 
Our subsidiaries’ risk and compliance management and control models is consistent with the frameworks approved by the group’s board of directors, which they adhere to through their own boards and can only adapt according to local law and regulation. In its duty to carry out aggregate risk oversight, Grupo Santander validates and challenges subsidiaries’ internal regulation and transactions, which results in a common risk management model across the group.
In 2021, we continued to strengthen our regional subsidiary relations model, based on regions, to find synergies for common operations and platforms building on our global and regional scale; to streamline processes; and to tighten control mechanisms so our business can grow, allocate capital more efficiently and offer the best service to our customers.
Local CRO interact regularly with their regional head of risk, the Group CRO and the Group CCO in periodic regional or country control meetings. Local and global Risk and Compliance functions also hold follow-up meetings to address special matters. The Group CRO and the Group CCO and regional heads of risk are involved in appointing, setting of objectives, reviewing and compensating their local counterparts to ensure proper risk management.
Grupo Santander enhances its relations with subsidiaries and its advanced risk management model through:

2.4 Risk management processes and tools. 
Grupo Santander has the following processes and tools to carry out an effective risk management:
Risk appetite and structure of limits Risk appetite is the volume and type of risks we deem prudent for our business strategy, even in unforeseen circumstances. It considers adverse scenarios that could have a negative impact on capital, liquidity and profitability. The board sets the Group's risk appetite statement (RAS) every year. Our subsidiaries' boards also set their own risk appetites annually. Each of those risk appetites translates into risk management limits and policies based on risk type, portfolio and segment.

Risk limits Risk limits Risk limits & policies & policies & policies Unit 1 Unit 2 Unit n. 
Business model and risk appetite fundamentals Santander's risk appetite is consistent with our risk culture and our business model built on customer focus, scale and diversification. At the core of our risk appetite are: • a medium-low and predictable target risk profile that is centred on retail and commercial banking, internationally diversified operations and strong market share; • stable, recurrent earnings and shareholder remuneration, sustained by a sound base of capital, liquidity and sources of funding; • independent subsidiaries that manage their own capital and liquidity, with risk profiles that do not compromise the Group’s solvency; • an independent risk function with involvement by senior management to embed a strong risk culture and drive a sustainable return on capital; • a global, holistic outlook through extensive control and monitoring of risks, businesses and markets; • a focus on products we know well; • a conduct model that protects our customers; and • a remuneration policy that aligns employees and executives' interests with risk appetite and long-term results.
Our risk appetite principles The principles that inform our risk appetite are: • the board and senior management's responsibility for risk appetite; • an enterprise-wide view of risk, backtesting and challenge of risk profile based on quantitative metrics and qualitative indicators; • a forward-looking view based on plausible assumptions and adverse/stress scenarios to reflect our desired risk profile in the short and medium term; • strategic and business plans embedded in daily management by policies and limits; • common standards that align each subsidiary's appetite with the Group's; and • regular reviews, best practice and regulatory requirements, with mechanisms in place to keep the risk profile stable and mitigate non-compliance.

While risk appetite limits are regularly monitored, specialized control functions report on risk profile and compliance with limits to the board and its committees every month. The link between risk appetite limits and the limits used to manage business units and portfolios is key to making risk appetite an effective tool for managing risks. Management policies and limits are based on the risk appetite statement (see sections 3.2 ‘Credit risk management’, 4.2 ‘Market risk management’ and 4.4 ‘Structural balance sheet risk management’ of this chapter).
Key initiatives in 2021 Santander continued to thoroughly review the impact of covid and the adequacy of our risk appetite to cope with the new landscape. We strengthened our controls and metrics to monitor our commitment to the environment and to the Paris Agreement for the transition to a low-carbon and climate-resilient economy more closely. Having achieved our aim to be carbon neutral in 2020, our ambition is to be net-zero in carbon emissions by 2050. We set our first decarbonization objectives, which are to stop providing financial services to power generation customers with a revenue dependency on coal of over 10% and to reduce our worldwide exposure to coal mining production to zero, a key step in fighting climate change.
Risk profile assessment (RPA) Identification and assessment are central to the management, control and reporting of Grupo Santander’s risk. To assess the Group's risk profile systematically, we use a single, robust methodology that allows us to analyse the various risk types described in our risk framework (outlined under section 2.2 'Risk factors'). In addition, it classifies them by different levels and unit according to a points system with four categories (“low”, “mediumlow”, “medium-high” and “high”).
The RPA methodology is based on the main principles of the identification and risk assessment model, such as: self-assessment and exercise suitability; efficiency; and holistic, in-depth risk analysis (with common approaches and alignment for decision-making). The three lines of defence take part in the assessment, strengthening our risk culture by reviewing how risks change and pinpointing areas for improvement.
Risk profile assessment covers: • risk performance (to measure exposure to each type of risk); • control environment (to measure the target operating model of our advanced risk management according to regulation and best market practice); and • forward-looking analysis (to measure threats that can affect business planning and strategic objectives).
In 2021, we revised and strengthened our control environment standards, adding an internal self-assessment questionnaire on the management of risks relating to environment and climate-related risks to check the implementation of measures designed to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.
At the end of 2021, Grupo Santander’s risk profile returned to “medium-low”. Our core profitability and credit quality indicators improved due to efficient risk management, a sustained low liquidity risk profile and the reopening of the economy spurred by vaccination and government stimulus in our geographies.
Furthermore, the severity of the emerging risks on our risk profile declined, as health indicators improved and the global economy shows signs of recovery. Grupo Santander maintains a robust risk control environment.
Scenario analysis Scenario analyses are a useful risk management tool to measure our resilience to stress situations under a forward-looking approach and, if necessary, prepare mitigating plans for expected loss, capital and liquidity. Our Research department plays a key role in determining analysis scenarios based on macroeconomic and other variables that can affect our risk profile in our markets. The governance and control of the entire process, including the review by our three lines of defence and senior management, is also a fundamental aspect to ensure its consistency and robustness, to which it also contributes: • develop and execute models that estimate future metric values (e.g. credit losses); • backtesting (in order to challenge model outcomes regularly); • our teams’ expert opinions and vast understanding of portfolios; and.

Responsible Corporate Economic and Risk management Contents banking governance financial review and compliance • thorough monitoring of models, scenarios, assumptions, results and mitigating management measures.
Grupo Santander has repeatedly obtained excellent quantitative and qualitative scores in the European Banking Authority’s (EBA) stress tests.
Scenario analysis applications We run a systematic review of our risk exposure under a base scenario and several adverse and favourable scenarios to predict potential solvency and liquidity changes. These exercises are fundamental for: • Regulatory exercises according to instructions given by EU and local supervisors.
• Internal capital and liquidity adequacy assessment processes (ICAAP and ILAAP), in which Grupo Santander follows its own approach to measure capital and liquidity under various scenarios.
• Risk appetite, which includes stressed metrics to determine the highest risk we can assume. Though risk appetite and capital and liquidity stress exercises are closely related, they have different time frames and granularity.
• Recurrent risk management also uses scenario analyses for: ◦ budget and strategy planning, when implementing a new risk approval policy or reviewing the Group’s risk profile, monitoring specific portfolios and business lines; ◦ systematic top risk identification and impact analysis (where each top risk relates to a macroeconomic or idiosyncratic scenario); ◦ our annual Recovery Plan, which specifies the tools Grupo Santander can use to survive a severe financial crisis. The plan includes financial and macroeconomic stress scenarios with varying levels of severity, plus idiosyncratic and systemic events.
◦ IFRS 9: Since 1 January 2018, regulation for estimating provisions have required scenario analysis models and methodologies.
◦ Credit and market risk stress testing exercises, simulating changes to expected losses or estimating required capital to absorb losses resulting from unforeseen events.
In the covid-19 pandemic context, scenario analyses continued to be instrumental in 2021 to check if the additional provisions recognized in 2020 were sufficient to cover expected losses caused by the health crisis. In the Group we have developed a new tool (Delphi) to review the calculation of provisions, using the latest best practices available in the industry, to better anticipate and manage the impacts of covid.
Across our geographies, macroeconomic conditions were differently affected by the progress of vaccination campaigns, government relief programmes and monetary and tax policies. Accordingly, our scenario analyses helped us recognize points of action, develop adequate commercial responses and adapt our risk strategy to conserve our strength and solvency.
For more details on scenario analysis, see sections 3.2 ‘Credit risk management', 4.2 ‘Market risk management’ and 4.6 'Liquidity risk management' and Note 53 section 'Expected loss estimation' in this report • Grupo Santander made significant inroads with climate-related analysis in 2021. We added the Network for Greening in the Financial System (NGFS) climate scenarios and created others to account for risks posed by the transition to a low-carbon economy and by potential climate events in certain geographies. Our 2021 ICAAP showed improvement against environmental and climaterelated risks, and we anticipate further progress in 2022. We will also take part in pilot stress tests led by the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) in 2022, which will be included in the Supervisory review and evaluation process (SREP).
For more details, see 'Monitoring' in section 10.2 'Climate and environmental risk management' in this chapter. 
Risk reporting structure (RRS) To provide senior managers with a complete, up-to-date understanding of our risk profile, the Enterprise-wide risk management team regularly consolidates and reports on current and future risks so the right decisions can be made in a timely manner.
We continue to change our reporting, as we simplify and automate processes, tighten controls and adapt to new needs. In 2021, to report on the covid crisis, we monitored such critical topics as the macroeconomic situation, health indicators, relief measures for our customers and risk areas, which helped us make decisions. We also vigorously accounted for initiatives relating to our strategic objectives, such as new regional structures and new business units.
Our risk reporting covers all factors set out in our risk framework, especially environmental, social and climate-related risks, as well as all those fundamental aspects that may be necessary for our risk assessment. We issue weekly, monthly and group-wide reports for senior managers; as well as monthly subsidiary risk reports and reports on each risk factor found in our risk framework. Our robust risk reporting structure is characterized by: • balanced data analysis and qualitative commentary (with future measures, alerts, risk appetite limits and emerging risks); • holistic, accurate overviews of risk factors, subsidiaries and markets; • consistent risk analysis structure and standards; and • metric reporting according to our corporate data framework, guaranteeing information quality and consistency.
This ensures complete, agile and dynamic reporting that provides a clear overview of current and future risks and enables us to adapt to emerging risks.
2.5 Models & Data Unit. 
In 2021, Grupo Santander made progress towards becoming the best open financial services platform, using advanced analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) to enrich its understanding of current and potential customers’ needs and to earn their trust.
The leading data scientists and analysts that make up the group's Models & Data unit (part of the Risk and Technology & Operations divisions) used state-of-the-art algorithms and models to help us achieve our targets and get the most out of data in a responsible way. During 2021, they worked on two priorities:
Annual report 2021 444


 

 

 
Responsible Corporate Economic and Risk management Contents banking governance financial review and compliance a. Strengthening the business, where AI and digitalization enable Santander to scale up and grow efficiently. The Models & Data teams in headquarters and each of our geographies help by: • growing the customer base: We select quality potential customers and get to know their needs and behaviours to boost onboarding and conversion rates. AI has been useful for customer approval, especially at Santander Brasil, where new account openings climbed from 51% to 76%. When combined with better digital customer experience, it proves highly beneficial at scale.
• increasing customer loyalty: We meet expectations and offer smart services throughout the customer life cycle. In particular, Santander España created and applied a machine learning model to split the Spanish economy into high-growth industries (in collaboration with Tresmares 1); identify SMEs in those industries; and design a value proposition that meets existing and potential customers' needs.
• maximizing profitability: Grupo Santander is increasing efficiency by using cognitive robotics to automate repetitive tasks. Santander México uses this type of robotics to review 20,000 digitalized collateral documents per month.
b. Enhancing risk management: Our data and models are key to regulatory compliance.
In 2021, Grupo Santander worked on internal ratings-based (IRB) 2.1 models programme to comply with the EBA Repair Programme (and other regulatory requirements), which sets out new provisions for internal models developed under the IRB approach. The programme posed significant planning and resource challenges for the industry. Our Data & Models teams created models to delve deeper into our portfolios and better manage their risks.
They also developed Reg-Tech apps to upgrade anti-money laundering practices in geographies as Santander Brasil. The apps use AI to prioritize major risk alerts for analysts and help scale antimoney laundering processes.
In the future, Santander will continue to innovate its risk management based on two pillars: • Boosting sustainable growth and climate risk management. In accordance with EBA requirements, the Models & Data teams quantify transition and physical risks from natural and climaterelated disasters based on geography and exposure.
• Promoting the use of new analysis techniques (AI) in risk models (especially for regulatory capital). Banco Santander took part in a study on machine learning models' prediction of credit default published by Banco de España 2 in early 2021, which showed that advanced models have greater predictive power than traditional ones.
Grupo Santander commits to promoting changes to risk management in banking through the responsible use of advanced analytics (machine learning and AI).

Responsible Corporate Economic and Risk management Contents banking governance financial review and compliance 3. Credit risk 3.1 Introduction. 
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss due to the failure to pay or impaired credit of a customer or counterparty Santander has financed or maintains a contractual obligation with. It is our most significant risk in terms of exposure and capital consumption, and includes counterparty risk, country risk and sovereign risk.
3.2 Credit risk management. 
We take a holistic view of the credit risk cycle, which includes the transaction, the customer and the portfolio to identify, analyse, control and decide on credit risk.
Credit risk identification is key to managing and controlling our portfolios effectively. We classify external and internal risks in each business and adopt corrective and mitigating measures when needed through the following processes: 1. Planning Our planning helps us set business targets and draw up concrete action plans within our risk appetite statement.
Strategic commercial plans (SCPs) are a risk management and control tool the business and risk areas prepare for our credit portfolios. They determine commercial strategies, risk policies, resources and infrastructure, ensuring a holistic view of portfolios.
In addition, they provide us with an updated view of portfolio credit quality to measure credit risk; run internal controls over the strategy with regular monitoring; detect significant deviations in risk and potential impacts; and take corrective actions when necessary.
The SPCs align with our risk appetite and our subsidiaries’ capital targets, and are approved and monitored by senior managers at each subsidiary before the group reviews and validates them.
2. Risk assessment and credit rating To analyse customers’ ability to meet contractual obligations, we use assessment and parameter estimation models in each of our segments. Our credit quality assessment models are based on credit rating engines, which we monitor to calibrate and adjust the decisions and ratings they assign. Depending on each segment, engines can be:
Rating: From mathematical algorithms that use a 1 quantitative module based on balance sheet ratios or macroeconomic variables, and a qualitative module supplemented by credit analysts' expert judgement. It is used in the SCIB, corporate and institutions, and SME segments (individually).
Scoring: Automated loan application assessment that 2 assigns a score to retail customers and small enterprises that do not have an assigned analyst for subsequent decision-making.
Our parameter estimation models follow econometric models built on our portfolios' historical defaults and losses. We use them to calculate economic and regulatory capital as well as IFRS 9 provisions for each portfolio.
We regularly monitor and evaluate models' suitability, predictive capacity, performance, granularity, compliance with policies and other related factors. We review ratings with the latest financial and other relevant information. We increased the reviews for customers who are subject to close observation or automatic warnings in risk management systems.
3. Credit risk mitigation techniques Risk approval is generally determined by the borrowers’ ability to pay when financial obligations fall due, regardless of any additional collateral or personal guarantees we require from them. We analyse funds or net cash flows from their businesses or income with no guarantors or assets pledged as collateral. When approving a loan, we always consider guarantors and collateral as a secondary means of recourse if the first channel fails.
Guarantees are a reinforcement measure in a credit transaction to mitigate a loss if the borrower defaults on their payment obligation.
We have credit risk mitigation techniques for various types of customer and product. Some are for specific transactions (e.g. property) while others apply to a series of transactions (e.g. derivatives netting and collateral). They can be grouped into personal and real guarantees or with credit derivatives coverage.
4. Limits, pre-classifications and pre-approvals We use SCPs to manage credit portfolios, defining limits for each of them and for new originations in line with our credit risk appetite and our target risk profile. Introducing our risk appetite into portfolio management strengthens controls over our credit portfolios.
Our limits setting processes, pre-classifications and pre-approvals determine the risk we can assume with each customer. Limits are approved by the executive risk committee (or delegated committees) and should reflect a transaction’s expected risk-return. We use different limits models based on the segment:
Annual report 2021 446


 

 

 

 

 

 

Responsible Corporate Economic and Risk management Contents banking governance financial review and compliance • Large corporates are subject to a pre-classification model based on a system for measuring and monitoring economic capital. Preclassification models set the level of risk we are willing to assume in transactions with customers or groups in terms of capital at risk (CaR), nominal CAP and maximum tenors, depending on the transaction type. To manage limits with financial entities, we use credit equivalent risk (CER), which includes current and expected risks with customers according to risk appetite and credit policies.
• Corporates and institutions that meet certain requirements (strong relationships, rating, etc.) are subject to a simpler preclassification model with an internal limit that benchmarks a customer's risk level against their repayment capacity, overall indebtedness and pool of banks.
Transactions with large corporates, corporates and institutions above certain limits or with special characteristics could require approval from a senior credit analyst or a committee.
• For individual customers and SMEs with low turnover, we manage large volumes of credit transactions with automated decision models to classify customers and transactions.
5. Scenario analysis In line with section 2.4 'Management processes and tools' of this chapter, our scenario analyses determine potential risks in credit portfolios; give us a better understanding of their performance under various macroeconomic conditions; and enable us to employ management strategies that will avoid future deviations from set plans and targets.
They simulate the impact of alternative scenarios in portfolios’ credit parameters (PD, LGD) and expected credit losses. We compare findings with the portfolio’s credit profile indicators to find the right measures for managers to take. The credit risk management of portfolios and SCPs incorporate scenario analyses.
6. Monitoring. 
Regularly monitoring business performance and checking it according to our original plans is key to our risk management. Our holistic customer monitoring aids the early detection of impacts on risk performance and credit quality. We assign customers a monitoring classification with a pre-determined course of action and ad hoc measures to correct any deviations.
In monitoring customers, local and global risk teams consider transaction forecasts and characteristics as well as changes in classification. It is based on the following customer segmentation: • Monitoring in SCIB is a function of business managers and risk analysts and provide an up-to-date view of customers’ credit quality to predict a potential customer's deterioration.
• For corporates, institutions and SMEs with an assigned credit analyst, we monitor more closely those customers that require so and review their ratings based on relevant indicators.
• For individual customers, businesses and smaller SMEs, we use automatic alerts to detect shifts in portfolio performance.
Our monitoring function uses the Santander Customer Assessment Note (SCAN). It helps set individual monitoring levels and frequencies, policies and actions for customers.
In addition to monitoring customer credit quality, we draw up control procedures to analyse portfolios and performance, as well as any possible deviations from planning or approved alert levels.
7. Collections and recoveries The Collections and Recoveries function is key to risk management and control. It sets a global strategy with general lines of action for our subsidiaries based on the economic landscape, business model and other local recovery conditions. Recovery management follows the EBA guidelines on the management of credit impaired and forborne exposures.
Its sustained value creation is based on effective and efficient collections management, for which digital channels that develop new customer relations are key. Our diverse customer base requires segmentation to manage recoveries competently. The highly technological and digital procedures we follow help us attend to large groups of customers with similar profiles and products. Our personalized management, however, focuses on customer profiles that require an assigned manager and tailored approach.
We split recovery management into four phases: arrears, credit impaired loans, write-offs and foreclosed assets. We may use mechanisms like portfolios sales and foreclosed assets in order to rapidly reduce deteriorated assets. We constantly seek alternatives to legal action in order to collect debt.
We include debt instruments in the write-off loans category (even if they are not past-due) if an individual analysis showing a noticeable and irreversible impairment leads us to believe recovery is remote. Though this may lead to full or partial cancellation and derecognition of the gross carrying amount of debt, we never interrupt negotiations and existing legal proceedings to recover debt. In countries with high exposure to property risk, we have efficient sales management instruments that help maximize recovery and optimize balance sheet stocks.
Forbearance Grupo Santander's internal forbearance policy is a reference for our subsidiaries locally and follows regulations and supervisory expectations such as the EBA Guidelines on the management of credit impaired and forborne exposures. It defines forbearance as the modification of a transaction’s payment terms to enable a customer who is experiencing (or may foreseeably experience) financial difficulties to fulfil their payment obligations; otherwise, there would be reasonable certainty that the customer would not be able to meet those obligations.
This policy also sets out rigorous criteria for assessing, classifying and monitoring forbearances to ensure the strictest possible care and diligence in recovering due amounts. Forbearance must focus on recovering due amounts and adapting payment obligations to customers' current circumstances. Thus, we must recognize losses as soon as we deem any amounts irrecoverable. The loans we put into forbearance to recognize risks appropriately must remain classified as credit impaired or on a watch-list for as long as necessary to ensure reasonable certainty of repayment. Forbearance may never be used to delay the immediate recognition of losses or hinder the appropriate recognition of risk of default.
Total forbearance amounted to EUR 36,042 million at the end of December 2021. After years of important decreases, due to the positive macroeconomic situation of the Group's main geographies, forbearance stock remained flat in 2020. The portfolio increased by 24% in 2021, as a result of greater volume of forbearance carried out.

Identifying and managing most vulnerable sectors Grupo Santander has implemented a quarterly sectoral monitoring process that enables the identification of sectors that could potentially be of concern. This process considers, among other things, the following information at the sector level: • Market information: Industries’ stock market performance.
• Analysts’ EBITDA forecasts for the coming years.
• Internal information: Changes in credit exposure, defaults (in different timelines) and stagings.
• Our industry experts’ opinion, based on specific details about our exposures and our relationships with customers.
As at December 2021, we considered the industries listed in the table below as vulnerable based on our analysis and the covid landscape, including their exposure (excluding individuals):
EXPOSURE TO VULNERABLE SECTORS. 
EUR million. 
Industry Exposure Stage 1 Stage 2 Stage 3. 
Automobile 31,600 90.6 % 7.7 % 1.7 %
Hotels, leisure, cruises & restaurants A 16,400 57.4 % 27.5 % 15.1 %
Transport 17,100 85.1 % 9.2 % 5.7 % Oil & Gas 22,100 96.5 % 2.3 % 1.2 % Retail (non-food) 21,700 87.1 % 9.1 % 3.8 % Construction B 12,800 78.5 % 12.1 % 9.4 %
A. Catering and others not included. B. Property development not included.
Total exposure to the most vulnerable industries fell 3.1% from last year to EUR 121.700 million at year end. Exposure to the most shortterm affected industries (hotels, leisure, cruises and restaurants; oil and gas; retail (non-food); and passenger transport) was EUR 65.300 million, down 1.4% compared to 2020.
Our findings were consistent with similar analyses conducted by the ECB, Banco de España and rating agencies.
Credit risk target operating model (ATOMiC) We launched our advanced target operating model in collaboration (ATOMiC) to bolster our credit risk strategy, permanently challenge the Group’s credit targets, and create the best bank in risk management in all of the markets where we operate. Its objective is to implement, extend, continuously improve and promote (under a realistic and medium-term goal) the credit target operating model (TOM) in our subsidiaries based on best practice in the Group and across the industry.
ATOMiC's success lies in the collaboration and best practice of experts from several geographies (Champions/Boosters/ATOMiC Team). Their over 40 success case studies (SCS) allowed to quantify benefits, apply lessons learned and identify impacts of each SCS, which enabled the development of TOM in each portfolio segment. They monitor progress twice a year through key performance indicators (KPIs) and have the support and commitment of a unique risk team.
ATOMiC has progressively embedded credit strategy in management and enabled us to bolster the control environment through greater preparation for unforeseen events like the Covid-19 crisis. It has also given us the ability to meet the EBA's Guidelines on loan origination and monitoring. In ATOMiC's first cycle, we accelerated and reinforced these priority initiatives: • C&R efficiency and digital connectivity; • foresight and preventive monitoring that use new data sources (transactional and CRM) and advanced analytics (early warning system) to determine what action to take towards customers; • industry sensitivity and forward-looking analysis through predetermined risk playbooks to make better decisions when anticipating unexpected changes; • risk-based pricing tools to ensure sustainable portfolio growth; and; • significant developments in customer pre-assessments and preapprovals through greater automation and digitalization.
2021 was crucial in setting management metrics to demonstrate how ATOMiC enhances lending and customer onboarding across our footprint. We came up with several tangible and homogeneous metrics to report to the Group's senior management, uncover trends, make comparisons and agree on medium-term improvements. The main aim was to create a common language to show the fruits of credit risk transformation. ATOMiC laid down solid foundations for us to continue building up our credit risk strategy over a long period. Continuous challenging of our ambition was key, not to mention the commitment and collaborative culture among our subsidiaries. That, together with an agile working methodology and robust organizational structure, enabled us to address the next challenge of defining the strategic credit lines that will shape our strategy for 2022-2025 and that align with our risk strategy and priorities: 1."Customer first" for an enhanced customer experience through digital processes and tailored solutions that help drive loyalty and grow the customer base; 2.Efficiency to increase volumes and expected profitability (riskadjusted return); 3."Responsible banking", with the inclusion of environmental, social and climate related risk in the lending process; 4."Forward thinking", including climate related scenarios in stress test; and 5.Exploring opportunities for shared services and fintechs.

Responsible Corporate Economic and Risk management Contents banking governance financial review and compliance 3.3 Key metrics 2021 general performance 2021 saw gradual economic recovery in our core markets, as well as progress with covid vaccination campaigns to ease the health crisis. That, along with effective credit risk management, helped boost Santander’s performance.
Q1’21 was marked by new, targeted lockdown measures, inconsistent vaccination programmes and the extension and revision of economic policies. Growth in corporate and large corporate portfolios offset the decline in consumer portfolios, while credit quality indicators began to stabilize. Loan-loss provisions fell sharply in all regions and in most subsidiaries.
The second quarter brought economic recovery on the back of vaccination progress in all regions. Credit volumes grew despite the ongoing impact of the pandemic and heightened liquidity in our markets; a stronger Brazilian real also reinforced this trend. By segment, lending to corporates and large corporates remained high. Key credit indicators reflected our strong credit quality, supported by mitigation measures and portfolio growth. Loan-loss provisions continued to fall. Most notably in the UK and the US, a greater economic outlook led to lower provisions.
The third quarter saw further recovery (in all regions), higher vaccination rates and the gradual lifting of restrictions relating to the health crisis. Currency depreciation slowed credit volume growth in South America. Nonetheless, the wholesale and retail banking portfolios continued to flourish, and the corporate banking portfolio began to tail off. Loan-loss provisions returned to Q1 levels following unusual market behaviour in the UK and US in Q2.
In the last quarter of the year, revenues continued to grow steadily as business recovered across all regions. In contrast to previous quarters, loan-loss provisions plunged owing mainly to the provisions recognized to cope with the pandemic in 2020, brighter macroeconomic outlooks and overall positive NPL and loan loss trends, especially among customers who benefited from relief measures (e.g. payment holidays) and the general positive portfolio performance.
As of December 2021, credit risk with customers rose 6.2% from 2020 within the same perimeter. This was mainly due to currency appreciation in our core markets. All our subsidiaries saw growth in local currency with the exception of Santander Spain and Santander Chile. Our credit risk remained diversified, with a strong balance between mature and emerging markets: Europe 34 (61%), South America (13%), North America (14%) and Digital Consumer Bank (11%).
Loan book growth offset the rise in credit impaired loans to EUR 33,234 million (+4.6% vs 2020 year end) and reduced our NPL ratio to 3.16% (-5 bps vs 2020).
In accordance with IFRS 9, Santander recorded loan-loss provisions of EUR 7,436 million (-39% vs December 2020) driven by economic recovery, federal economic stimulus in the US, effective portfolio management and the use of additional provisions raised in 2020 to mitigate potential impact that could arise as a result of the covid-19 pandemic. Santander's total loan-loss allowances amounted to EUR 23,698 million. This brought our NPL coverage ratio to 71.3%, down from 76.4% in December 2020.
Regarding the support measures put in place in 2020 to tackle the covid-19 pandemic, at the end of December 2021, 99.8% of the payment holidays granted as part of Santander’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic had ended and only 7% were classified as stage 3. The positive performance owed to better macroeconomic conditions in our main markets.
Government liquidity programmes remained in force in 2021. By geography, Spain makes up 68% of total exposure to those programmes with an average ICO guarantee coverage of 77%. The UK makes up 13% of total exposure, with an average coverage of 98%.
In light of those measures, Grupo Santander made additional credit loss allowances throughout 2020 upon analysing vulnerable sectors and struggling segments and estimating further impairment of loans and advances amid the economic crisis caused by the pandemic; those provisions are an indication of the economy's actual structural deterioration. Our estimation, which was based on available information and affected by the high uncertainty at the time, is consistent with ECB forecasts. The macroeconomic scenario was not “through the cycle” but included a balance sheet with short- and long-term provisions. We expected most macroeconomic indicators in those scenarios to reach pre-crisis levels in the first quarter of 2022 (with the exception of housing prices, which should reach them in the first quarter of 2023).
In 2020 and 2021, the Group closely and frequently monitored: (1) pandemic developments and macroeconomic outlooks; (2) institutions and central banks’ forecasts; and (3) Santander’s portfolios in each country.
In accordance with established governance, we monitored or updated macroeconomic scenarios according to new, realistic and substantiated information. When calculating IFRS 9 provisions at the end of 2021, we updated our most recent scenarios by eliminating the overlay (which accounts for structural economic deterioration), the effect of which had been assimilated by the model upon recalibrating its parameters according to current macroeconomic conditions and outlooks in order to re-estimate losses.
Also, we gradually used the additional credit loss allowances for the groups most affected by the pandemic in line with the portfolio’s performance on the back of extraordinary support measures. The outstanding moratoria at the end of December 2021 amounted to EUR 166 million.

Geographical distribution and segmentation Santander organizes its credit risk function around three customer groups: • Individuals: All salaried individuals, subdivided by income level to manage risk by customer type.
Mortgages to individuals made up approximately 37% of net customers loans at the end of 2021. They are mainly in Spain and the UK, and primarily consist of residential mortgages with low risk profiles and NPL ratios as well as robust coverage levels. Low risk profiles produce low losses.
• SME, commercial banking and institutions: Companies and selfemployed individuals, public entities and private not-for-profit entities.
• Santander Corporate and Investment Banking (SCIB): Corporate customers, financial institutions and sovereigns in a closed list that is revised annually through comprehensive customer analysis (business type, geographic diversification, product types, revenue volume for Santander, etc.).

Financial asset impairment The IFRS 9 impairment model applies to financial assets valued at amortized cost; debt instruments valued at fair value with changes in other comprehensive income; leasing receivables; and commitments and guarantees not valued at fair value. The portfolio of financial instruments subject to IFRS 9 has three credit risk categories (or stages): ◦ Stage 1: Financial instruments with no significant increase in risk since initial recognition – the impairment provision reflects expected credit losses from defaults over the twelve months from the reporting date.
◦ Stage 2: Financial instruments with a significant credit risk increase since initial recognition but no materialized impairment event – the impairment provision reflects expected losses from defaults over the financial instrument’s residual life.
◦ Stage 3: Financial instruments with true signs of impairment as a result of one or more events resulting in a loss – the impairment provision reflects expected losses for credit risk over the instrument’s expected residual life.

We quantify expected losses from credit events using an unbiased, weighted consideration of up to five future scenarios that could affect our ability to collect contractual cash flows. They consider the time-value of money, information from past events, and current conditions and projections of GDP, house pricing, unemployment and other important macroeconomic factors.
We calculated impairment losses using parameters (mainly EAD, PD, LGD and discount rate) based on internal models, and regulatory and management expertise. Far from being a simple adaptation, we defined and validated them according to specific requirements of IFRS 9 and other guidelines by regulators, supervisors and other international organizations (EBA, NCAs, BIS, GPPC, etc.), such as forward-looking information, point-in-time (PiT) vision, multiple scenarios, calculation of losses for the entire life of the transaction through lifetime PD, etc.
• Identifying a significant increase in credit risk: when classifying financial instruments under stage 2, we consider: ◦ Quantitative criteria: We review and quantify changes in the risk of default during their expected life based on their credit risk level on initial recognition.
To recognize significant changes so instruments can be classified in stage 2, each subsidiary set quantitative thresholds for its portfolios based on Santander's guidelines for consistent interpretation across all our footprint.
Of those quantitative thresholds, we consider two: the relative threshold, which shows the difference in credit quality since the transaction was approved as a percentage of change; and the absolute threshold, which calculates the total difference in credit quality. All subsidiaries apply them (with different values) in the same manner. The use of one or both depends on portfolio type and other aspects, such as the starting point for average credit quality.
◦ Qualitative criteria: Several indicators aligned with ordinary credit risk management indicators (e.g. past due for over 30 days, forbearance, etc.). Each subsidiary defined these criteria for its portfolios.
We supplement these qualitative criteria with expert opinions.
• Definition of default: For provisions, we use the definition of default dictated by Article 178 of the CRR. We are gradually applying the new definition to provisions calculation according to.

Responsible Corporate Economic and Risk management Contents banking governance financial review and compliance the EBA’s guidelines; we are also considering applying it to prudential framework once the competent authorities approve it for calculating regulatory capital.
• Past, present and future information: To estimate expected losses, we require a great deal of expert analysis as well as past, present and future data. We base expected loss estimates on multiple macroeconomic scenarios, measure the probability of loss considering past events, current conditions, and future trends of GDP, unemployment and other macroeconomic indicators. We use forward-looking information in internal management and regulatory processes under several scenarios, which helps us make sure our processes are consistent.
• Expected life of financial instruments: We estimate the expected life of financial instruments according to their contractual terms (e.g. prepayments, duration, purchase options, etc.). The contractual period (including extension options) is the maximum time frame for measuring the expected credit loss. If financial instruments have an undefined maturity period and available balance (e.g. credit cards), we estimate its expected life based on the total exposure period and effective management practices to mitigate exposure.

United Kingdom. 
General overview Credit risk with customers in the UK (excluding Santander Consumer UK and Santander London Branch) grew 4.2% (-2.5% in local currency) year-on-year to EUR 262,869 million. The UK accounts for 25% of Santander’s loan portfolio.
Since the pandemic began, we’ve granted 368,000 payment holidays and EUR 5,280 million in government-backed loans to help our customers.
The NPL ratio, 1.43%, increased compared to 2020 (+19 bps), due to the increase in the SME portfolio offset by the decrease observed in the wholesale portfolio. The profile of the different segments remains stable.

Mortgage portfolio performance Because of its size, we closely monitor Santander UK’s mortgage portfolio for both the entity itself and the group. As of December 2021, the portfolio amounted to EUR 209,949 million, growing by 4.3% in local currency. It comprises residential mortgages granted to new and existing customers which are first lien mortgages. There are no second or more liens on mortgaged properties.
2021 was a year of strong mortgage activity, mainly due to the higher demand after the covid-19 restrictions were lifted and the reduction of the stamp duty rates up until September. As a consequence, Santander UK achieved all-time high mortgage lending origination levels in June.
In accordance with Santander's risk management principles, properties are appraised independently before we approve a new mortgage. In line with market practice and legislation, property values used as collateral for granted mortgages are updated quarterly by an independent agency's automatic appraisal system.
Credit exposures are predominantly in Southeast UK and the London metropolitan area.
Geographically, credit exposures are predominantly in the South East of the UK and the London metropolitan area.

Home mover: customers who change houses, with or without changing the bank granting the loan.
Remortgage: customers who switch the mortgage from another financial entity.
First time buyer: customers who purchase a home for the first time.
Buy to let: houses bought for renting out.
Santander UK's wide range of mortgage products include: • Interest-only loans (23%): Customers pay interest every month and repay the principal at maturity. Loans require an appropriate repayment vehicle, such as a pension plan or an investment fund. This product is common in the UK. Santander UK applies restrictive policies to mitigate inherent risks. For instance, a maximum loanto-value (LTV) ratio of 50% entails more stringent approval criteria and assessment of ability to pay, simulating the repayment of both interest and capital.
• Flexible loans (5%): Loan agreements allow borrowers to modify monthly payments or draw down additional funds up to a set limit under various conditions.
• Buy-to-let (8%): Buy-to-let mortgages account for a small portion of the total portfolio and are subject to strict risk approval policies.
The NPL ratio reflects the mortgage portfolio’s strength, which was stable at 1.01% at the end of December 2021 (-5 bp YoY). The portfolio’s credit quality owed to high repayment rates as payment holidays expired (of which, 100% expired), and to low levels of default.
Prudent approval policies put the portfolio’s simple average LTV at 41%. 2% of the portfolio has a LTV of between 85% and 100%. These policies resulted in no sign of risk quality deterioration in new business.

Spain. 
General overview Santander España’s credit risk totalled EUR 221,100 million (21% of the Group’s total). It is appropriately diversified among products and customer segments.
Amid economic and credit recovery, as macroeconomic figures improved following covid-19 lockdowns in 2020, consumer loans (especially mortgages) grew significantly; but the corporate and SME lending remained below 2020 numbers, while we maintained positions with customers in liquidity support programmes (i.e. ICO lines of credit) without having to seek new financing. Total credit risk decreased -0.1% from December 2020. The ICO loans in corporate and SME lending amounted to a significant EUR 27,294 million; around half of them were extended.
The credit portfolio’s NPL ratio was 5.77%, 46 bps lower than in December 2020. This better overall portfolio performance was driven by customer support programmes; the regularization of several restructured positions; and portfolio sales.
The additional provisions raised to mitigate the potential impacts from the exceptional circumstances of the covid-19 pandemic, increased the NPL coverage ratio to 52% (+5 pp vs December 2020). The credit impaired portfolio declined mainly from loans with the highest expected losses.
The cost of credit reflects the rise in covid provisions, with slight improvement at the end of 2021 compared to December 2020.

In 2021, mortgage origination soared 94% year-on-year on the back of higher customer demand caused by the pandemic. The residential mortgage portfolio in Spain maintained a medium-low risk profile with low expectations of additional impairment: • Principal repayment starts on the first day of all mortgage transactions.
• Because early repayment is common, so the average transaction life is shorter than the agreement term.
• High-quality collateral, concentrated almost exclusively in financing for first-time buyers.
• The average affordability rate stood at 26%.
• 90% of the portfolio has an LTV below 80%, calculated as the ratio of total risk to the latest available appraisal.
• All customers applying for a residential mortgage are subject to a rigorous credit risk and solvency assessment by credit analysts to determine if their income will be sufficient to pay loan instalments and stable until the end of the mortgage term.

Corporate and SME financing Credit risk with SME and corporates in commercial banking, which is Santander España's core lending segment (at 53% of total credit risk) declined 3.1% from December 2020 to EUR 117,544 million, mainly due to a drop in the SME portfolio. Most of the portfolio is customers with an assigned credit analyst to monitor their loans throughout the risk cycle.
The portfolio is highly diversified and not concentrated in any industry. Its NPL ratio stood at 7.50% in December 2021, up 8 bps from December 2020 due to lower volume; meanwhile, credit impaired stock remained flat. 2021 brought stable portfolio figures after significant growth in 2020 due to liquidity support programmes (ICO), which after the initial grace period are now being repaid.

Fiscal stimulus together with the reopening of the economy favoured a strong recovery that was moderated as of the summer due to problems on the supply side. The supply chain and labour constraints pushed inflation up to 7.0%, while the unemployment rate fell to 3.9% in November, leading to the start of the Fed's withdrawal of monetary stimulus.
As of December, Santander US's lending had grown 13.8% from 2020, particularly in SCIB portfolios in Santander Bank N.A., the New York branch, and the Miami branch. Excluding foreign exchange (FX) effect, growth was 8%.
Santander US remains focused on supporting its customers and making inroads with its strategic initiatives to enhance customer experience and allocate capital to its businesses.
Its NPL ratio rose to 2.33% (+29 bps in the year), while the cost of credit fell to 0.43% (-243 bps YoY). Loan-loss provisions dropped 82% due to lower net charges, and the improved macroeconomic outlook, customer loan relief measures and steadfast used car prices prompted lending growth.

The bank's primary goals include increasing the SCIB business — 22% of total credit risk — by enhancing customer experience and growing core customers and deposits through digital, branch and commercial transformation initiatives; leveraging its deposit base to support its commercial real estate business; and strengthening its auto finance partnerships. Its 15.1% hike in lending spanned all segments. Minus the FX effect, the increase was lower, standing at 9.2%.
Its NPL ratio increased to 0.85% (+4 bps in the year) as of December 2021, and the cost of credit fell to -0.06% due to the release of provisions based on better-than-expected market performance, customer behaviour (support programmes and fiscal stimulus) and greater recovery.

Santander Consumer USA Santander Consumer USA (SC USA) presents higher risk indicators than other Santander US units due to the nature of its business (auto loans and leasing). Its focus remains on managing the profitabilityto-risk balance through pricing aligned with the credit quality of the customer/transaction, while improving the dealer experience.
In 2021, loan originations grew more than 4% year-on-year, returning to the pre-pandemic prime and non-prime mix on the back of the commercial relationship we have with Stellantis Group.
Auto originations continued to increase, driven mainly by hikes in used car prices and demand. As of December, the NPL ratio rose to 6.27% (+101 bps in the year) and the cost of credit stood at 1.54% (-654 bps YoY). Annual net credit losses fell year on year due to customer support programmes (triggered by the health crisis), federal fiscal stimulus packages and greater recovery driven by a surge in used car prices. Due to the increase in defaults, the nonperforming coverage ratio fell to 176% (-54 pp in the year).

Brazil. 
General overview Despite the economic recovery due to the reopening of the service sector, in line with the advances in the vaccination campaigns and the lift of restrictions, international supply problems have continued to hamper industry growth.
Santander Brasil's credit risk amounted to EUR 85,702 million. It increased by 15% from 2020. Excluding the exchange rate effect, it grew by 13%. As of December 2021, Santander Brasil accounts for 8% of Grupo Santander's loan book. Santander Brasil's loan book is distributed as follows: 5.29% 5.25% 5.32% 4.59% 4.88% 93% 107% 100% 113% 111% 4.36% 4.06% 3.93% 4.35% 3.73%

In line with the commercial strategy, we continued to build an auto Portfolio segmentation platform focused on end-to-end customer experience, thanks to Dec.21 data which we achieved a 20% market share in vehicles (including individuals and companies). Santander Auto began selling insurance to corporates and had 19% penetration in insurance.
Credit cards broke customer capture records and remained third in the market. We also hit records figures in billing. The surge in mortgage origination continued, where Santander Brasil leads the home equity segment with a market share of 25%.
The SME portfolio (Varejo PJ) grew significantly due to the contribution of the different billing clusters that make the portfolio and its different products. State-backed guarantees to combat the effects of the pandemic ended in December 2020, although a new window opened in July 2021.
Our digital business continued to grow. 90% of transactions were digital. Furthermore, Gente, our virtual assistance channel based on artificial intelligence, has over 18 million hits per month.

In the individuals segment, growth in local currency was strong. Market share of payroll loans, mortgages and other low-risk products increased.
SME lending performed beyond expectations and started to show signs of recovery. All ratios returned to pre-crisis levels. The portfolio was also well provisioned and saw continuous improvement in its risk profile. We must pay close attention to the maturities of government programmes and other payment deferrals to confirm the recovery of the SME market.
To monitor the credit quality of our loan book and prevent deterioration, one of the main credit risk performance indicators we track is the ‘Over 90' impairment ratio. It continues to indicate that Grupo Santander is outperforming its local peers, having stood at 2.7% at December 2021 (+60 bps vs 2020 year-end), below the average of its competitors.

Credit risk from financial markets activities This section covers credit risk from treasury management through money market financing and counterparty risk products to satisfy customers’ (especially credit institutions) needs.
According to the CRR, counterparty credit risk results from the likelihood that a customer in a derivatives contract on financial securities or commodities, repurchase agreement, securities lending, long settlement transactions, margin lending and other transactions could default before the final settlement of the transaction’s cash flows.
To measure exposure, we use two methods: “Mark-tomarket” (MtM) (replacement cost of derivatives) plus potential future exposure (“add-on”); and the Montecarlo simulation to calculate exposure for certain countries and products. We also calculate capital at risk and unexpected loss (economic capital, net of collateral and recoveries, after deducting expected loss). At market close, we recalculate exposures by adjusting all transactions to their new time horizon, adapting potential future exposure and applying netting, collateral and other mitigants. Thus, we can check exposures daily against the limits approved by senior management. For risk control, we use a real-time integrated system that shows the exposure limit with any counterparty, for any product and term, and in all subsidiaries.
Counterparty risk exposures: over-the-counter (OTC) transactions and organised markets (OM) By December 2021, after applying netting and collateral agreements for counterparty risk, the positive market value of total exposure (under management criteria) was EUR 5,491 million (net exposure of EUR 31,444 million).

Collateral helps reduce counterparty risk. It consists of highly liquid instruments with economic value that are deposited or transferred from one counterparty to another to guarantee or reduce counterparty credit risk from portfolios of cross-risk derivatives. We usually measure transactions subject to collateral agreements daily, applying contractual parameters to quantify the collateral (in cash or securities) to pay or receive from the counterparty. Amid the pandemic, the processes we have in place to manage collateral in the Group properly and more often have proved effective. The collateral received under CSA, OSLA, ISMA, GMRA and other collateral agreements signed by the Group amounted to EUR 25,899 million (including EUR 15,089 million in received collateral for derivatives), with 41% in cash. The remaining collateral is subject to strict quality policies in regard to the issuer and their rating, debt seniority and haircuts.

Due to counterparty credit risk, we calculate the results of trading portfolios by applying credit valuation adjustments (CVA) to over-thecounter (OTC) derivatives. We also make debt valuation adjustments (DVA) in view of the risk of Santander that our counterparties assume.
At the end of December 2021, CVA adjustments amounted to EUR 236.5 million (a decrease of 31% compared to the end of 2020) and DVA adjustments were EUR 161.8 million (a decrease of 17,5% compared to the end of 2020). These impacts are mainly due to the continuous credit market improvement , the creation of specific credit curves for certain counterparties and the introduction of methodological improvements in the exposure calculation.
The definition and methodology for calculating the CVA and DVA are set out in the section 4.2 ‘Market risk management'.

Counterparty risk, organized markets and clearing houses Santander’s policies aim to promote early action according to regulation for OTC derivatives, repurchase agreements and securities lending (whether settled through clearing houses or bilaterally). In recent years, we have gradually standardized OTC transactions to settle and clear new contracts through clearing houses according to current regulation, in addition to increasing internal use of electronic execution systems. We also manage transactions not settled by clearing houses actively to optimize their volume according to regulation on margins and capital. While our counterparty risk management does not contemplate the credit risk in such transactions, we have been calculating regulatory credit exposure for organized market exchanges since the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD) IV and the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) took effect in 2014, transposing the Basel III principles on capital calculation.

Credit derivatives We use credit derivatives to hedge transactions, customer business in financial markets and trading. The notional value of the credit derivatives Santander has negotiated is low (0.3% of the notional value of counterparty risk). Furthermore, we subject credit derivatives to internal robust controls and procedures to minimize operational risk.
Concentration risk Concentration risk control is key for our management. We continuously monitor credit risk concentration by region and country, economic sector, customer type and other criteria.
The board sets concentration limits according to risk appetite (See ‘Risk appetite framework and structure of limits’ in 2.4 'Management processes and tools'). Accordingly, the executive risk committee develops risk policies and reviews the appropriate exposure levels so we can effectively manage credit risk concentration.
As indicated in the key metrics section of this chapter, our credit risk is diversified among our core markets (UK 25%, Spain 21%, United States 11%, Brazil 8%, etc.). In terms of sector diversification, 56% of our credit risk is with individuals, who are inherently highly diverse. Our lending portfolio is also well distributed, with no significant concentrations in any specific industry. The chart below shows the distribution as of December 2021:

Because Santander is subject to the CRR stipulations on large risks, exposure with a customer or group of associated customers will be considered “large exposure” if its value is equal to, or greater than, 10% of eligible capital. To limit large exposures, no entity may assume any exposure with a single customer or group of associated customers if it exceeds 25% of their eligible capital, having factored in the credit risk reduction effect set out in the regulation.
The use of risk mitigation techniques resulted in no groups triggering those thresholds as of the end of December. Regulatory credit exposure with the 20 biggest groups within the scope of large risks made up 5% of credit risk (lending to customers and off-balance sheet risks) as of December 2021.
Our Risk division works closely with the Finance division to manage credit portfolios, aimed at reducing the concentration of exposures through credit derivatives, securitizations and other techniques to optimize the risk-reward of the entire portfolio.
Country risk Country risk is a component of credit risk arising in transactions with clients resident in a particular country due to circumstances other than usual business risks. It consists of sovereign risk, transfer risk and others that might affect international financing transactions (wars, natural disasters, current account balance crises, among others). It is embedded in our provisioning models and processes, in compliance with the applicable regulation.
19. Countries that are not considered low risk by Banco de España 20. Internal rating are applied'.
Our country risk management continued to follow a standard of maximum prudence. We assume country risk very selectively in transactions that enhance the global relationship with our customers.
Sovereign risk and risk with government agencies Sovereign risk arises from central bank transactions (including regulatory cash reserves), government bonds (public debt) and transactions with non-commercial government institutions funded exclusively by a state’s budget revenue. In some respects, Banco Santander's standard for sovereign risk differs from the European Banking Authority's (EBA) standard for regular stress testing. In particular, the EBA does not consider deposits with central banks, exposures with insurance companies or indirect exposures to guarantees and other financial instruments; however, its standard does generally include central, regional and local government agencies.
Our local sovereign exposure, in currencies other than the official currency of the country of issuance, is not significant ( EUR 10,013 million, 2.6% of total sovereign risk) according to our management criteria. Furthermore, exposure to non-local sovereign issuers involving cross-border risk is even less significant (EUR 7,011 million, 1.8% of total sovereign risk).The sovereign debt we hold in Latin America is almost entirely in local currency, recorded in local ledgers and predominantly short-term.
In recent years, our total sovereign risk exposure has been consistent with both regulation and our strategy. Because it spans countries with diverse macroeconomic conditions, growth scenarios, interest rates and exchange rates, it varies on account of our strategy to manage liquidity and hedge both interest rate and foreign exchange risk. Furthermore, our sovereign debt strategy also sets exposure limits based on each country’s credit rating. The table below shows exposure ratios by level 20: 2021 2020 2019.

Responsible Corporate Economic and Risk management Contents banking governance financial review and compliance 4. Market, structural and liquidity risk 4.1 Introduction. 
This section describes our market risk management and control in 2021, covering trading risk as well as liquidity and structural risks. It also contains a brief description of our methodologies and metrics.
Activities exposed to market risk encompass transactions where risk is assumed as a consequence of potential changes in interest rates, inflation rates, exchange rates, stock prices, credit spreads, commodity prices, volatility and other market factors; the liquidity risk from our products and markets, and the balance-sheet liquidity risk. Therefore, they include trading risks and structural risks.
• Interest rate risk arises from movements in interest rates that reduce the value of a financial instrument, a portfolio or the Group. It can affect loans, deposits, debt securities, most assets and liabilities held for trading, and derivatives.
• Inflation rate risk arises from movements in inflation that can reduce the value of a financial instrument, a portfolio or the Group. It can affect loans, debt securities and derivatives (e.g. inflation swaps and futures) whose profitability is linked to inflation.
• Exchange rate risk is the possibility of loss because the currency of a long or open position will depreciate against the base currency. It can affect debt in subsidiaries whose local currency is not the euro, as well as loans denominated in a foreign currency.
• Equity risk is the possibility of loss from open positions in securities if their market price or expected future dividends fall. It affects shares, stock market indices, convertible bonds and derivatives with shares as the underlying asset (put, call, equity swaps, etc.).
• Credit spread risk is the possibility of loss from open positions in fixed-income securities or credit derivatives if their yield curve, or the recovery rate of their issuer or type change. A spread is the yield difference between financial instruments against a benchmark (e.g. the internal rate of return (IRR) of government bonds and interbank interest rates).
• Commodity price risk is the possibility of loss from movements in commodity prices. Our commodity exposure is minor and stems mainly from commodity derivatives.
• Volatility risk is the possibility of loss caused by movements in interest rates, exchange rates, the stock market, credit spreads and other risk factors affecting portfolio value. It is inherent to all financial instruments whose value considers volatility (especially options contracts).
Derivative contracts (such as options, futures, forwards and swaps) can mitigate market risks partially or fully.
Some market risks that require more complex hedging are: • Correlation risk is the possibility of loss due to an adverse correlation between risk variables that affect portfolio value. Risk variables could be the same (e.g. two FX rates) or different (e.g. an interest rate and a commodity price).
• Market liquidity risk is the possibility that fewer market makers or institutional investors, a large number of transactions, market instability and other factors will cause the Group or a subsidiary to exit a position at a worse market price or trade cost. Exposure to different products and currencies can also increase this risk.
• Pre-payment or cancellation risk originates when mortgages, deposits and other on-balance-sheet instruments give holders the option to buy or sell them, thus altering future cash flows. Potential mismatches on the balance sheet pose a risk since cash flows may have to be reinvested at an interest rate that is potentially lower (assets) or higher (liabilities).
• Underwriting risk is the possibility that the bank will have to hold part of a debt issue it has underwritten or agreed to place if it cannot all be placed among potential buyers.
In addition, during 2021, there was an increased focus on climate and environmental risk, which arise from the possibility that changes in climate may adversely affect the value of a financial instrument, a portfolio or the Group as a whole. Changes in climate include both extreme weather scenarios as well as gradual climate change and other situations where there is environmental degradation. This risk may have an impact both on financial instruments value or portfolios and on Santander's liquidity. The Group measures this risk through stress scenarios for both market and liquidity risk.
Balance sheet liquidity risk (unlike market liquidity risk) is the possibility of loss caused by forced disposal of assets or cash flow imbalance if the bank meets its payment obligations late or at excessive cost. It can cause losses by forced asset sales or impacts on margins due to the mismatch between expected cash inflows and outflows.
Pension and actuarial risks (explained at the end of this section) also depend on market variables.
We aim to comply with the Basel Committee’s Fundamental Review of the Trading Book (FRTB) and the EBA’s Guidelines on the management of interest rate risk arising from non-trading book activities. The purpose of several projects we run is to provide risk control managers and teams with the best market risk management tools under the right governance framework for the models we use.

IBOR Reform Since 2015, central banks and regulators have organized working groups to propose alternative risk-free-rates to the Euro Overnight Index Average (EONIA), the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR).
For the purpose of risk control during the transition, we launched the Santander's global IBOR Transition Programme in 2019, making sure concerned business units and subsidiaries understand risks regarding the transition and can take the right mitigating measures.
It takes recommendations, guidance and targets from regulators and working groups into account. The areas it is structured on are Technology and operations; the Legal department; Customer relations; Risk and model management; Conduct and communications; and Accounting and Finance.
In 2021, the programme focused on handling the transition to LIBOR and EONIA rates in December 2021. In 2022, the program will continue to address next steps in the transition related to the contract history management and the LIBOR dollar termination milestone in June 2023.
Santander also keeps taking part in public and private initiatives on benchmark interest rate indices reform.
For more details on IBOR reform, see Notes to the consolidated annual accounts nº 53 section 'c) Trading market risk management'.
4.2 Market risk management. 
Limits management and control system. 
The Market Risk function's daily control keeps market risk positions within approved limits, and evaluates performance and significant fluctuations in metrics. This assessments inform regular reports for senior management and both internal and external stakeholders to ensure proper oversight of market risk management.
We set market risk limits in a dynamic process according to the risk appetite in the annual limits plan prepared by senior management and extended to all subsidiaries (See “Risk appetite and structure of limits” under Section 2.4 ‘Management processes and tools’).
To ensure limits cover operations exposed to market risk from various perspectives, we take a prudent approach involving these metrics: • Value at Risk (VaR) and Stressed VaR limits.
• Limits of equivalent and/or nominal positions.
• Interest rate sensitivity limits.
• Vega limits.
• Delivery risk limits for short positions in securities (fixed-income and securities) • Limits on the volume of effective losses to protect earnings from the period.: ◦ Loss trigger.
◦ Stop loss.
• Credit limits: ◦ Total exposure limit.
◦ Jump-to-default limit by issuer .
◦ Others.
• Limits for origination transactions.
Those general limits include sub-limits that make the structure granular enough to control market risks from Santander’s trading operations. We monitor subsidiaries’ positions daily, checking changes in portfolios and at trading desks in order to detect events that may necessitate immediate mitigation.
The Group establishes global approval and control limits; global approval limits with local control; and local approval and control limits. They are requested by each subsidiary’s business manager in consideration of business particulars, budgetary targets and the risk/ reward ratio. They are then approved by risk bodies according to internal governance processes. Subsidiaries must adhere to approved limits. On the day a limit breach occurs, subsidiary business managers must provide a written explanation with an action plan and corrective measures, such as reducing a position within the limits or formulating a strategy that justifies raising limits.
Methodologies and key aspects a) Value at Risk Value at risk (VaR), our standard methodology for managing and controlling market risk, measures maximum expected loss with a certain confidence level over a given time. For standard historical simulation, the confidence level is 99% and the time horizon is one day. We also make statistical adjustments (i.e. a two-year horizon or daily figures from the 520 days since the reference date for calculating VaR) to account for recent events that influence our risk levels in a quick and efficient manner.
We report the highest of two VaR figures, which we calculate every day. To one of them, we apply an exponential decay factor, which assigns a low weighting to the oldest observations; the other assigns the same weighting to all observations. At the same time, we use the same methodology for VaR to calculate “value at earnings” (VaE), which gives maximum potential earnings with a certain confidence level over a given time.
As a risk metric, historical VaR simulation has many advantages. It states a portfolio’s market risk in a single figure according to market movements, without assumptions about functions, forms or correlations between market variables.
Still, it also has limitations. Some are inherent to the VaR metric, no matter the methodology used to calculate it. In particular: • Because VaR is calibrated at a certain confidence level, it does not reveal potential losses beyond the VaR level.
• The liquidity horizon of certain products in a portfolio is longer than the VaR model’s.
Annual report 2021 467


 

 

 

 

 
Responsible Corporate Economic and Risk management Contents banking governance financial review and compliance • VaR is a static measurement of portfolios’ risk and subject every day to significant (albeit unlikely) changes.
Historical simulation also has limitations, such as: • high sensitivity to time frame used • inability to show plausible high-impact events outside the time frame used; • no market inputs (e.g. correlations, dividends or recovery rates) for measurement parameters; and • slow adaptation to new volatility and correlations, as the weighting of the newest and the oldest data is the same.
To circumvent some limitations, we use stressed VaR (sVaR) and expected shortfall (ES); calculate VaR with exponential decay; make conservative measurement adjustments; and run analyses and backtesting to assess the accuracy of the VaR calculation model.
b) Stressed VaR (sVaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) Every day, we calculate sVaR for our main portfolios using the same VaR calculation method but with these exceptions: • A window of 260 observations (as opposed to 520 for VaR) over a continuous stress period. For each portfolio, we review the history of a subset of market risk factors (selected with expert criteria) and the most significant positions per books.
• Unlike with VaR, the percentile we take to get sVaR has uniform weighting and is not the highest one based on exponential and uniform weightings.
To calculate ES, we estimate expected potential loss above the level obtained from VaR and assign uniform weightings to all observations. Unlike VaR, ES has the advantage of showing tail risk (i.e. the risk of loss due to a rare event) while being a subadditive metric. According to the Basel Committee, ES with 97.5% confidence interval is at a similar risk level than VaR with 99% confidence interval.
c) Scenario analysis Santander’s risk measures are based on normal market conditions, price stability, sufficient liquidity and other assumptions used in daily risk management and decision-making. However, it is possible that extreme movements and strong unforeseen changes will not be properly anticipated. Therefore, we run scenario analyses, which prove important to predict the outcome of a wide range of risks and estimate the capital needed to absorb any losses in case such unexpected events occur.
The scenarios we use to predict future risks are important to overcome the limitations of models and historic data; support liquidity and capital plans; report on risk tolerance levels in place; and help us execute risk reduction and contingency plans under stress. All units engaged in trading regularly calculate and review historical, hypothetical and reverse stress-test scenarios.
d) Gauging and backtesting measures According to regulation, the VaR model must accurately show material risks. Because VaR uses statistical techniques under normal conditions for a certain confidence level over a set time horizon, the estimate of maximum potential loss may differ from actual losses.
Santander reviews and contrasts the VaR calculation model on a regular basis to verify its accuracy.
Our Market risk functions run internal backtesting, contrast VaR and review hypothesis about portfolios for subsidiaries that apply the internal market risk model. For subsidiaries with an approved internal model, we run regulatory backtesting to find exceptions (where daily profit or loss is higher than VaR or VaE) that will influence the calculation of regulatory capital requirements for market risk.
Through backtesting, we assess the quality and general effectiveness of our risk measurement model, comparing daily VaR or VaE from D-1 with these P&L figures on D: • Economic P&L: P&L at end-of-day mark-to-market or mark-tomodel value. Backtesting indicates if VaR/VaE methodology to measure and aggregate risk is appropriate.
• Current P&L: The difference between a portfolio’s end-of-day value and real value by the end of the next day, in light of intraday trading but not fees or interest margin. Backtesting results enable us to determine the number of regulatory exceptions.
• Hypothetical P&L: The difference between a portfolio’s end-of-day value and real value by the end of the next day, based on the assumption that positions will not vary. This backtesting does not consider the time effect, intraday trading, nor changes in portfolio positions in order to maintain consistency with VaR. We use it to determine if portfolios can withstand an intraday risk not reflected in closing positions (nor in VaR) over time. We also use it to count the number of regulatory surpluses.
• Theoretical P&L: Calculated with the market risk calculation engine, without intraday trading, changes in portfolio positions or time (“Theta”). We use this backtesting to check the quality of the internal VaR model.
Every day, we run backtesting for our subsidiaries. We also do internal (non-regulatory) backtesting every day, week or month depending on portfolio granularity.
The number (or proportion) of exceptions we record is one of the most intuitive indicators of a model’s soundness. As our regulatory backtesting covers a historical period of one year (250 days) and a 99% VaR, we expect two to three exceptions per year. To calculate regulatory capital for market risk, we take the regulatory K 35 from the number of exceptions we find in actual and hypothetical backtesting.
e) Analysis of positions, sensitivities and results Santander uses positions to quantify the market value of derivative transactions by main risk factor and with the Delta value of futures and options. We can express risk positions in subsidiaries’ base currency and in the currency used to standardize information. We monitor positions every day to correct any incidents we uncover immediately.
Sensitivity to market risk is the estimated impact of change in a risk factor on the market value of an instrument or portfolio. To measure it, we take analytical approximations from partial derivatives or a full portfolio revaluation.
The Risk function’s daily P&L statement is an excellent indicator of the impact of changes of financial variables on portfolios.

Annual report 2021 468


 

 

 

 
Responsible Corporate Economic and Risk management Contents banking governance financial review and compliance f) Derivatives activities and credit management Because of their atypical characteristics, we have special measures to monitor derivatives and credit management daily. We monitor the sensitivity of underlying assets to price movements (Delta and Gamma), to volatility (Vega 36) and over time (Theta). We also systematically check measurements of their sensitivity to spread, jump-to-default risk and position concentrations by rating.
According to regulation and the Basel Committee’s recommendations, we also calculate the incremental risk charge (IRC), an additional metric for credit risk in the trading book. The IRC covers default risk and rating migration risk (which VaR does not show adequately) by taking credit spread changes into account. In general, we apply it to government and corporate bonds; to forwards, options and other bond derivatives; and to credit default swaps, asset-backed securities and other credit derivatives. To calculate it, we take direct measurements of loss distribution tails at the right percentile (99.9%) over a one-year horizon and follow the Montecarlo method with one million simulations.
g) Credit valuation adjustment and debit valuation adjustment Santander makes credit and debit valuation adjustments to calculate trading book value.
A credit valuation adjustment (CVA) is a change in the value of OTC derivatives to take into account counterparty credit risk. For a given counterparty, it adds up to the CVAs for all its maturity dates. We calculate it based on exposure at default, loss given default, probability of default, the discount curve and other inputs.
A debit valuation adjustment (DVA) is similar to a CVA but results from the risk our counterparties assume with OTC derivatives traded with Banco Santander.
4.3 Market risk key metrics. 
In 2021, risk levels from trading generally remained low amid less volatility than in 2020, as well as economic recovery spurred by vaccination progress. However, uncertainty persisted in light of the possibility of new covid variants. Risks mainly originated from trading non-complex instruments with customers. Most were to hedge interest rate and FX risks. Like last year, our own trading portfolio positions’ contribution to overall risk stayed lower than in previous years.
2021 saw generally low consumption of trading limits, which correspond to the Group's market risk appetite.
Our stressed scenarios also revealed low risk levels based on observed losses in stress testing. We run the scenarios time and again to measure any risk not covered by the usual metrics for monitoring and controlling market risks.
Market risk capital requirements We use internal and standard models to determine market riskrelated capital requirements.
In 2019, the ECB authorized Santander to use internal market risk models to calculate regulatory capital for the trading portfolios of our subsidiaries in Spain, Chile and Mexico; and to extend our Spain subsidiary’s internal model to our London branch. As we aim to get the rest of our subsidiaries gradually approved, we have been working closely with the ECB and reviewing the new requirements recently published by the Basel Committee to strengthen financial institutions’ capital.
Santander launched the Market risk advanced platform (MRAP), a global initiative to strengthen market risk infrastructure according to the new Fundamental Review of the Trading Book (FRTB); and to adapt internal market risk models to the latest Targeted Review of Internal Models (TRIM) and to supervisory demands. MRAP takes a multi-disciplinary and multi-regional approach. It includes all subsidiaries that generate market risk, as well as the Market risk function, IT, Front office, the Finance function, the Regulatory affairs function and other relevant stakeholders. In 2021, it continued to improve our functional and IT architecture and our operational models significantly, while generating synergies between initiatives and resources.
According to Santander’s internal market risk model, we calculate consolidated regulatory capital as the total regulatory capital of the subsidiaries that the ECB has approved. This standard for consolidating capital does not consider capital savings owing to geographical diversification and is, therefore, conservative.
In light of the ECB’s approval, we use advanced methods with VaR, sVaR and IRC as fundamental metrics to calculate market risk-related regulatory capital consistently with the Basel requirements and, in particular, with the EU Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR).

VaR analysis As demonstrated by the VaR of SCIB’s trading portfolio, Santander's market risk strategy focuses on trading with customers to minimize net directional exposure and keep risk diversified by geography and risk factor.
Despite constant market volatility (especially in regard to interest and FX rates), VaR stayed mostly below the average of the last three years, with the exception of a spike in the last quarter of the year . In this period, there was an increase in market volatility due to the uncertainty caused by the potential impact of the new covid variant (Omicron). This could lead to a possible economic growth slowdown, mainly due to new disruptions in supply chains together with increases in energy prices, closing December VaR at EUR 12.3 million.

A. In North America and South America, VaR levels of credit spreads, and in North America for VaR of commodities, are not shown separately due to their low or null materiality.
At the end of December, VaR was EUR 4.0 million higher than at the end of 2020; however, average VaR fell by EUR 2.0 million. Average VaR fell for most risk factors owing to low market volatility throughout the year. By region, average VaR decreased in Europe and especially in North America with lower exchange rate volatility.
By risk factor, VaR has followed a generally stable trend in recent years. For many factors, temporary VaR increases generally owe more to short-term price volatility than to significant changes in positions.

Backtesting. 
Actual losses can differ from predicted losses because of the mentioned VaR’s limitations. Santander measures the accuracy of our VaR calculation model to make sure it is reliable (see “Methodologies and other key details” under section 4.2 ‘Market risk management’). The most important tests we run involve backtesting: • Backtesting of hypothetical P&L and of the entire trading book showed no exceptions to 99% VaR and VaE in 2021.
• The results for the past year are consistent with the assumptions of the VaR calculation model.

We aim to keep open net risk as low as possible. Trading includes equity, fixed-income and FX options, chiefly in Spain, Brazil, the UK and Mexico.
The graph below shows the Vega VaR of structural derivatives over the last three years. It has fluctuated around an average of EUR 2.0 million. In general, high VaR values stem from significantly high market volatility, such as at the start of the health crisis, amid changes to monetary policy, or at times of political uncertainty in our geographies.
Average VaR was based on interest rates, equities and FX rates. In 2021, average risk (EUR 2.6 million) was slightly higher than in 2019 and 2020 (see table below):

Thanks to our risk culture and prudent risk management, exposure to complex structured instruments and vehicles is minor. At the end of December 2021, we had exposure to: • hedge funds (as the counterparty in derivative contracts): EUR 109 million (indirect). We review this type of counterparty risk on a case by case basis, setting collateralization ratios based on each fund's characteristics and assets.
• monolines: no exposure at the end of December 2021.
Santander’s policy on approving new derivatives transactions has always been extremely prudent and conservative. It is closely monitored by senior management.
Scenario analysis We regularly calculate and review stress test scenarios for all the trading portfolios of the group and its subsidiaries, such as:
Historical scenarios Historical scenarios consider trading portfolio performance during a crisis or significant past market events to estimate maximum losses if such events reoccur.
• “Subprime crisis”: Historical scenario based on 2007-2008 events arising from the US subprime mortgage crisis. The financial crisis caused high volatility and drastically low liquidity in markets across the globe. For each market risk factor, we determine the worst market shocks over one-day and ten-day horizons.
• “Covid crisis”: Historical scenario added to our stress testing programme in 2020 and based on abrupt movements in financial markets owing to the health crisis. After calculating a ten-day horizon of peak trading losses in the first half of 2020, all risk factors were affected. Stock indices plummeted, volatility increased for all risk factors, emerging market currencies depreciated, government bond yields hit record lows and credit spreads widened significantly.
Hypothetical scenarios We use extreme scenarios based on market risk shocks that do not necessarily relate to past events. Unlike generally ex post historical scenarios, hypothetical scenarios are ex ante.
• “Abrupt crisis”: A scenario of strong, sudden movements in all risk factors, including higher yield curves, stock market crashes, a stronger US dollar against other currencies, higher volatility, wider credit spreads, declines in commodity prices, reduction in dividends and default from main fixed-income and equity positions.
• “Worst case”: A hypothetical scenario that combines movements of each risk factor with its volatility. We base these scenarios on historical volatility with between ± 3 and ±6 standard deviations per day (irrespective of any historical correlation between them) in order to review trading books’ risk profile and potential maximum losses under the worst possible scenario.
• EBA’s adverse scenario: A hypothetical scenario based on the EBA’s proposed adverse macroeconomic scenario for all market risk factors in biennial EU-wide stress testing.
• Forward-looking scenario: A plausible hypothetical scenario defined and calculated on the basis of portfolio positions and expert opinions about expected short-term market risk movements that could have a negative effect on trading positions.
Reverse stress test scenarios Reverse stress test scenarios identify market variable shifts that can lead to a loss that will endanger our survival. They complement traditional stress scenarios and help signal business vulnerabilities, hidden risks and interactions between risk factors. They begin with a known stress result (such as failure to achieve determined capital, liquidity or solvency ratios) and identify extreme scenarios.
Other stress test scenarios We also run different quarterly stress tests based on extreme market movements to determine potential losses or major impacts on capital: • IRC scenarios: Designed to stress market risk capital consumption by incremental risk charge (IRC), associated with default risk and credit rating change risk of issuers of debt instruments present in trading portfolios.
• Stress proxy scenario: Specially constructed to measure how selecting the wrong proxies would affect VaR.
• Illiquidity and concentration scenarios: To show the impact of scarce liquidity in markets under stress, price gaps and concentration risk.

Responsible Corporate Economic and Risk management Contents banking governance financial review and compliance 4.4 Structural balance sheet risk management. 
Limits management and control systems The policies of senior management dictate mechanisms to monitor and control structural risk according to regulatory requirements and our risk appetite. The mechanisms consider sub-types of structural risk and their implications, contingencies and interrelations.
The Structural risk function’s role in the second line of defence is to ensure structural risks are understood, controlled and reported to senior management according to established governance: • It sets interest rate risk metrics and reviews and challenges structural risk appetite and limits proposed by the first line of defence.
• It oversees the first line of defence’s structural risk management and checks compliance with set limits.
• It regularly reports on risk profile to senior management and issues guidelines to business lines about measures it deems necessary.
• It evaluates and challenges commercial proposals and gives senior management and business units information to understand the interest rate risk of Santander’s businesses and operations.
• It confirms proper structural risk procedure, in addition to formulating and overseeing models and policies.
Like market risk, structural risk also has an annual plan framework to set structural balance sheet risk limits according to risk appetite.
• Balance-sheet structural interest-rate risk: ◦ Limit on net interest income (NII) sensitivity over a 1 year horizon.
◦ Limit on the sensitivity of economic value of equity (EVE).
◦ Limit on the market value of ALCO portfolios under stress scenarios and that given their accounting classification (fair value with changes in equity) could have an impact on shareholders' equity.
• Structural exchange rate risk: ◦ Limit on the net permanent position of the core capital ratio.
◦ Limit on individual hedge required for each currency.
Business lines’ risk managers must prove explanations for potential limit and sub-limit breaches as well as an action plan to correct them.
Methodologies and other key details a) Structural interest-rate risk As part of structural risk, interest rate risk in the banking book (IRRBB) is the main source of balance sheet risk.
Santander measures the potential impact of interest rate movements on EVE and NII. Because changing rates may generate impacts, we must manage and control many subtypes of interest rate risk, such as repricing risk, curve risk, basis risk and option risk (e.g. behavioural or automatic). Interest rate risk in the balance sheet and market conditions and outlooks could necessitate certain financial measures to achieve Santander's desired risk profile (such as selling positions or setting interest rates on products we market). The metrics we use to monitor IRRBB include NII and EVE sensitivity to interest rate movements.
• Net interest income sensitivity. 
Net interest income (NII) is the difference between interest income from assets and the interest cost of liabilities in the banking book over a typical one- to three-year horizon (one year being standard in Santander). Because NII sensitivity is the difference in income between a selected scenario and the base scenario, its values can be as many as considered scenarios. It enables us to see short-term risks and supplement economic value of equity (EVE) sensitivity.
• Economic value of equity sensitivity. 
Economic value of equity (EVE) is the difference between the net current value of all assets minus the net current value of all liabilities in the banking book. It does not include shareholders’ equity and noninterest-bearing instruments. Because EVE sensitivity is the difference in EVE between a selected scenario and the base scenario, it can have as many values as considered scenarios. It enables us to see long-term risks and supplement NII sensitivity.
b) Interest rate models Interest rate risk metrics consider the behaviour of financial products under stress scenarios in which uncertainty is common and the failure to meet contractual terms is possible. We have methodologies that help explain how such products will behave. These are our key interest rate risk models: • Treatment of liabilities without stated maturity. 
Santander's model uses such variables as stable and unstable volumes, the rate of settlement over time and the difference between customer rates and market rates to model non-maturity account balances.
• Prepayment treatment for certain assets. 
Prepayment risk mainly affects fixed-rate mortgages at subsidiaries where their contractual rates are low compared to market levels and there is an incentive for customers to amortize in advance (in whole or in part). In variable rate products, the prepayment is due to other factors such as economic cycle, tax factors, cultural factors, etc. The impact in terms of IRRBB risk is more limited by having a variable repricing. In the Group, this risk is modelled and included in the risk appetite metrics.
c) Structural foreign exchange rate risk/hedging of results Every day, we measure FX positions, VaR and P&L.
d) Structural equity risk We measure equity positions, VaR and P&L.
4.5 Structural balance sheet risk key metrics. 
Consistent with previous years, the market risk profile of Santander’s balance sheet remained moderate in 2021 in terms of asset, shareholders’ equity and NII volumes. Each subsidiary’s Finance division manages interest rate risk from commercial banking and is responsible for handling structural risk from interest rate fluctuations.
To measure interest rate risk, Santander uses statistical models based on strategies to mitigate structural risk with interest-rate.

Structural foreign exchange rate risk/results hedging Our structural FX risk stems mainly from the income and hedging of foreign currency transactions for permanent financial investments. In our dynamic management of this risk, we aim to limit the impact of FX rate movements on the core capital ratio. In 2021, we hedged nearly all currencies that have an impact on our core capital ratio.

Responsible Corporate Economic and Risk management Contents banking governance financial review and compliance. 
In December 2021, our permanent exposures (with potential impact on shareholders’ equity) were, from largest to smallest, in US dollars, British pounds sterling, Brazilian reais, Mexican pesos, Chilean pesos and Polish złoty.
We use FX derivatives to hedge part of those permanent positions. The Finance division manages FX risk and hedging for the expected profits and dividends of subsidiaries whose base currency is not the euro.
Structural equity risk Santander holds equity positions in its banking and trading books. They are either equity instruments or stock, depending on the share of ownership or control. By the end of December 2021, the equities and shareholdings in the banking book were diversified among Spain, China, Morocco, Poland and other countries. Most of them invest in the financial and insurance sectors. We have minor equity exposure to property and other sectors.
Structural equity positions are exposed to market risk. We calculate their VaR with a set of market prices or proxies. At the end of December 2021, VaR at a 99% confidence level over a one-day horizon was EUR 309 million (EUR 319 million in 2020 and EUR 170 million in 2019).
STRUCTURAL VaR. 
Structural VaR With such a homogeneous metric as VaR, we can fully monitor market risk in the banking book (not including SCIB’s trading operations, as explained in Section 4.3 ‘Market risk key metrics’).We differentiate fixed income based on interest rates and credit spreads in ALCO portfolios, FX rates and shares.

4.6 Liquidity risk management. 
The Liquidity risk function’s role in the second line of defence is to ensure liquidity risks are understood, controlled and reported to senior management and across the Group according to established governance: • It determines liquidity risk and provides detailed measurements of current and emerging risks.
• It sets liquidity risk metrics, and reviews and challenges liquidity risk appetite and limits proposed by the first line of defence.
• It oversees the first line of defence’s liquidity risk management; measures how long business will remain within risk appetite limits; and checks compliance with liquidity risk limits.
• It reports to governing bodies on risk, risk appetite and exceptions.
• It evaluates and challenges commercial and business proposals, and gives senior management and business units the information they need to understand Santander’s liquidity risk.
• It provides a comprehensive overview of our liquidity risk exposure and profile.
• It makes sure the liquidity risk procedures in place are appropriate to manage business within risk appetite limits.
Methodologies and key other key details Grupo Santander measures liquidity risk with tools and metrics that account for the appropriate risk factors.
a) Liquidity buffer The liquidity buffer is the total liquid assets a bank has to cope with cash outflows during periods of stress. The assets are free of encumbrances and can be used immediately to generate liquidity without losses or excessive discounts. The liquidity buffer is a tool for calculating most liquidity metrics. It is also a metric with defined limits for each subsidiary.
b) Liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) The liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) is a regulatory metric. Its purpose is to promote the short-term resilience of a bank’s liquidity profile and make sure it has enough high-quality liquid assets to withstand a considerable idiosyncratic or market stress scenario over 30 calendar days, in addition to a currency distribution according to its needs.
c) Wholesale gap metric The wholesale liquidity metric measures the number of days the Group would survive if it used liquid assets to cover lost liquidity from a wholesale deposit run-off (without possible renewal) over a set. 
Annual report 2021 477


 

 

 

 

 

Responsible Corporate Economic and Risk management Contents banking governance financial review and compliance time horizon. We also use it as an internal short-term liquidity metric to reduce risk from dependence on wholesale funding d) Net stable funding ratio The net stable funding ratio (NSFR) is a regulatory metric we use to measure long-term liquidity risk. It is the ratio of available stable funding to required stable funding. It requires banks to keep a robust balance sheet, with off-balance-sheet assets and operations financed by stable liabilities.
e) Asset encumbrance metrics We calculate two metrics to measure asset encumbrance risk. On the one hand, the asset encumbrance ratio gives the proportion of encumbered assets to total assets; on the other, the structural asset encumbrance ratio gives the proportion of encumbered assets by structural funding transaction (namely long-term collateralized issues and credit transactions with central banks).
f) Other liquidity indicators In addition to traditional tools to measure short and long-term liquidity and funding risk, Santander has a set of additional liquidity indicators to complement those and to measure other non-covered liquidity risk factors. These include concentration metrics, such as the main and the five largest funding counterparties, or the distribution of funding by maturity. Additionally, we calculate a number of metrics on the institution’s ability to generate liquidity through collateralized financing, such as overcollateralization, eligibility ratios assets without charges and deadlines for their placement.
g) Liquidity scenario analysis Our four standard liquidity stress test scenarios are: i. an idiosyncratic scenario of events detrimental only to Santander; ii. a local market scenario of events highly detrimental to a base country’s financial system or real economy; iii. a global market scenario of events highly detrimental to the global financial system; and iv. a combined scenario of the most severe idiosyncratic and local and global market events, occurring simultaneously in an interconnected manner.
We use these stress test outcomes as tools to determine risk appetite and support business decision-making.
h) Liquidity early warning indicators (EWI) The system of early warning indicators (EWI) consists of quantitative and qualitative liquidity indicators that help predict stress situations and weaknesses in the funding and liquidity structure of Santander entities. External indicators relate to market-based financial variables; internal indicators relate to our own performance.
i) Intraday liquidity metrics. 
Santander follows Basel regulation and calculates several metrics and stress scenarios for intraday liquidity risk to maintain a high level of control.
4.7 Liquidity risk key metrics. 
Santander's sound liquidity and funding situation stands on a decentralized liquidity model. Each subsidiary manages its own liquidity independently, keeping a large stock of highly liquid assets.
In general, our LCR remained stable and well above the regulatory threshold. In 2021, our minimum required LCR was 100% and our risk appetite limit was 110%. We calculate and monitor this metric every day.
We manage liquidity buffers effectively to maintain a sound risk profile within regulatory limits and a profitable balance sheet. They mostly consist of level 1 assets: cash and sovereign debt, adequately diversified by currency according to the Group’s balance sheet needs.
Our subsidiaries have a sound balance sheet and stable funding structure, supported by a large base of customer deposits, low dependence on short-term funding and liquidity metrics well above local and corporate regulatory requirements and within risk appetite limits.
The regulatory NSFR of our core subsidiaries and the Group remained above the regulatory requirement and internal risk appetite. In June 2021, we adapted our metric calculation to the new implementing technical standards (ITS) in the EBA’s Reporting framework 3.0.
Our main sources of structural asset encumbrance are collateralized issues (e.g. securitizations and covered bonds) and credit transactions with central banks with collateral. The higher asset encumbrance from 2020 carried over into 2021 on the back of more appeals to central banks by using the management drivers provided for the covid scenario. Santander’s asset encumbrance is consistent with the other European banks’.
As demonstrated by stress scenarios run under uniform corporate standards, the balance sheets of Santander’s units are robust. Under the worst scenario, every unit would survive and handle liquidity needs with nothing more than its liquidity buffer for at least 45 days.
Santander has worked to introduce intraday liquidity risk management into its main metrics by setting daily limits and warning indicators to help anticipate contingencies.
For more details on liquidity metrics, see section 3.4 ‘Liquidity and funding management’ of the chapter on Economic and financial review.
4.8 Pension and actuarial risk management. 
Pension risk Santander covers financial, market, credit and liquidity risks from the assets and investments of employees’ defined benefit pension funds, as well as actuarial risks from pension obligations. We aim to recognize, measure, control, mitigate and report on pension risk and all its sources. We estimate combined losses each year on assets and liabilities under a stress scenario that accounts for shifting interest rates, exchange rates, inflation, stock markets, property values and credit spreads.
In 2021, the markets’ effect on our pension risk was positive mainly because of higher discount rates in our main geographies. Also, Santander took measures in core units to reduce exposure to actuarial and pension risk.
Actuarial risk Actuarial risk stems from biometric changes in defined benefit recipients and life insurance policyholders’ life expectancy; from suddenly higher non-life insurance payments; and from.

Responsible Contents banking policyholders’ unexpected behaviour to file claims covered by insurance policies.
These are the actuarial risks we distinguish: • Life liability risk: risk of loss on liabilities due to changing risk factors that affect pension obligations. We split it into: ◦ mortality/longevity risk: risk of loss on liabilities due to death or survival rates that exceed expectations.
◦ morbidity risk: risk of loss on liabilities due to changes in estimated policyholder disability or incapacitation rates.
◦ surrender/lapse risk: risk of loss on liabilities due to early policy surrender or changes in policyholders’ exercise of withdrawal rights, extraordinary premium payments or suspension of premium payments.
◦ expense risk: risk of loss on liabilities from negative shifts in expected costs.
◦ catastrophe risk: losses caused by catastrophic events that increase the bank’s life insurance obligations.
• Non-life liability risk: risk of loss on liabilities from risk variations that increase Santander's non-life payment obligations towards employees. We split it into: ◦ premium risk: loss from insufficient premiums to cover future claims.
◦ reserve risk: loss from insufficient reserves for unpaid claims (including management costs).
◦ catastrophe risk: losses caused by catastrophic events that increase the bank’s non-life insurance obligations.

Responsible Corporate Economic and Risk management Contents banking governance financial review and compliance 5. Capital risk 5.1 Introduction. 
Our structural risk includes the risk of insufficient quality or quantity of capital to meet internal business objectives, regulatory requirements and market expectations.
Our Capital Risk function, which is part of our second line of defence, controls and oversees first-line capital management. It checks that our capital adequacy and coverage match our risk profile. It also approves and monitors transactions that could be significant risk transfers (SRT).
It brings together capital planning, budget execution and tracking, and the ongoing measurement, reporting and disclosure of capital data (described below).
The Capital Risk function controls and oversees the capital activities carried out by the first line of defence. These activities split into four workflows to ensure monitoring is adequate to Santander’s risk profile: • Capital planning: internal process to determine capital levels and returns according to our strategy. Because we must ensure solvency and efficiency of capital, we identify the necessary measures to achieve our capital ratios and return on capital targets.
• Capital adequacy: assessment of capital levels against the type and amount of risk assumed based on the risk profile assessment (RPA), our strategy and risk appetite. For more details, see section 2.4 'Management processes and tools' - Risk profile assessment and Risk appetite and structure of limits.
• Capital risk measurement: process to cover required actions to measure capital metrics, based on a set methodology for obtain final figures required. It also supports the stages of capital management, monitoring, oversight and control.
• Origination: assessment of our portfolios' capital efficiency for identifying securitization, risk mitigation techniques, asset sales and other capital optimization initiatives.
In 2021, the function continued to work on implementing capital risk operating model improvements across the Group. A key objective was to reduce the capital risk profile through more robust control and oversight environment, which we achieved by: • revising and updating corporate and local capital risk procedures; • improved traceability on capital planning; • standardization of capital reporting under our common guidelines while adapting to local market and regulations; and • following up regularly on local progress made on the TOM rollout.
Key initiatives 2021 The year 2021 saw economic recovery on the back of progress in the vaccination process and the gradual lifting of restrictions. Capital risk management focused on protecting solvency and making sure internal objectives were met. We identified and assessed the risks that could affect solvency and continuously monitored key metrics.
We closely track the evolution of our organic capital generation and securitizations plan and the impact of regulators’ market risk and credit risk model reviews, such as the targeted review of internal models (TRIM) on low default portfolios; the new definition of default (NDD); and the amendments to counterparty credit risk (SACCR) and NPL provision regulations. We also checked the impact of market variables on capital levels. We continued to implement hedging policies to mitigate exchange rate volatility on our CET1 ratio.
The Capital Risk function periodically establishes uncertainty levels on budget execution, evaluating forecast possible deviations.
At year-end, our fully-loaded CET1 was 12.12%, above our 11-12% target. When including the minority interest acquisition of SC USA, which closed on 31 January 2022, and the announced acquisition of Amherst Pierpont Securities (APS) by Santander Holding USA - still subject to complete regulatory approval - , the fully-loaded CET1 ratio would be 11.96%, at the top of our 11-12% target.
The increase in fully-loaded CET1 ratio for the year is 23 bps, which reflects the strong organic generation of 118 bps based mainly on the year's profit and the growth in risk-weighted assets (RWA). This is supported by an adequate management, as well as by the recovery of the securitization activity.
In addition, we registered -49 bps from regulatory and model impacts and -46 bps from other items on the back of market developments.
Under IFRS 9 transitional arrangements, the phased-in CET1 ratio was 12.51% and the total phased-in capital ratio was 16.81%, comfortably meeting the ECB's 8.85% and 13.01% minimum levels, respectively. The fully-loaded leverage ratio was 5.21% and the phased-in ratio was 5.37%.
We kept all ratios above solvency appetite limits throughout the whole year.

5.2 Capital risk management. 
In the second line of defence, capital risk management can independently challenge business and first-line activities by: • reviewing key items affecting capital ratios to supervise capital planning and adequacy exercises.
• identifying key metrics to calculate regulatory capital; setting tolerance levels; and analysing significant variations and single transactions that impact on capital; and • reviewing and challenging proposed capital actions according to capital planning and risk appetite.
Supervision of capital planning and adequacy exercises The Capital Risk function reviews capital planning and adequacy exercises to make sure capital is consistent with risk appetite and the risk profile. Its core objectives are: • ensuring the monitoring of Grupo Santander's significant risks in the course of its operations; • checking that planning methodologies and assumptions are appropriate, • confirming that results are reasonable and consistent with business strategy, the macroeconomic environment and system variables; • assessing the consistency of exercises, especially ones that use baseline and stressed scenarios.
Capital planning and adequacy supervision follows these phases:
Definition of scope Supervising capital planning and adequacy begins with proposed materiality based on the level of importance of subsidiaries' riskweighted assets to the Group. It may include other units, businesses and portfolios (even if they are not significantly material) whose impact on strategy, compliance with the global plan or timely relevance might require analysis.
Qualitative analysis We run a qualitative review of forecasting to ensure proper governance.
Quantitative analysis We quantitatively assess metrics and components affecting RWA, available capital forecasts and pre-provisions net revenues (PPNRs). This phase requires proper coordination with subsidiaries to analyse local projections, which underpin group-wide projections and ensure traceability.
Conclusions and disclosure Based on the outcomes of the capital planning and adequacy phases, Grupo Santander conducts a final assessment that covers the scope of analysis, detected weaknesses and areas for improvement. We report to senior management according to governance procedures, ensuring effective and constructive challenge of proposed capital plans from the second line of defence.
Ongoing oversight of capital measurement Continuous monitoring of our regulatory capital measurement is an additional capital risk control function to ensure the right capital risk profile. We conduct a qualitative analysis of the regulatory and supervisory framework and a review of capital metrics and specific thresholds. We also monitor compliance with capital risk appetite to maintain capital levels above regulatory requirements and market expectations.
This function follows these phases and procedures:
Definition of metrics and thresholds The function sets metrics and thresholds used in supervision every year to monitor and control capital risk. They consist of: • Primary metrics, which cover capital ratios and numerator and denominator components at the highest level.
• Secondary metrics, which include a more extensive breakdown (for instance, credit RWA or the basis for measuring market RWA).
• Supplementary metrics for more detailed analyses.
Thresholds for certain metrics trigger a more detailed analysis and explanation.
The internal ‘Capital measurement control metrics guidelines’ outline these metrics, thresholds and sources of information.
Preliminary analysis At this stage of the control process, we analyse qualitative issues, such as process governance and the regulatory framework. We review our capital management measures to fulfil supervisory authorities' recommendations and instructions.
Assessment and measurement The Capital Risk function uses received information to review primary and secondary metrics, detect variations that might exceed defined thresholds and run a detailed analysis of the causes based on the supplementary metrics. If a subsidiary or global area is the cause of a threshold breach, it must provide the Capital Risk function with additional information on volume variations, one-off events, capital actions and other items.
We also monitor capital appetite metrics every month to check for excesses in the Group and our subsidiaries, which we report to the corresponding governing bodies every quarter.
Conclusions and disclosure The body responsible for capital risk control analyses the report and conclusions. If needed, it will submit them to the second-line (capital.

Responsible Corporate Economic and Risk management Contents banking governance financial review and compliance committee) or first-line (risk control committee) committees for deliberation.
Securitizations oversight The Capital Risk function oversees securitizations that might be significant risk transfers (SRT) originated by Santander, in accordance with articles 243 and 245 of Regulations (EU) 2017/2401 and 2017/2402.
Oversight is an essential prerequisite for synthetic and traditional securitization, especially if they can reduce RWA under regulatory standards. It aims to make sure that the Capital risk function analyses the conditions that could alter a securitization's SRT classification, namely: • if it can effectively transfer risk; • if it complies with all prudential regulation requirements; • if its risk parameters follow our methodology; and • if its economic rationale that meets group-wide standards.
SRT supervision is split into these stages: • ECB pre-notification: The Capital Risk function issues an assessment before notifying the ECB of an intended securitization that may be an SRT.
• Validation: Capital and risk committees review the securitization based on the capital risk function's assessment to validate it.
• ECB notification: Submission of final securitization documents to the ECB take place no later than 15 days after the securitization's closing date.
• Monitoring: The Capital Risk function regularly monitors executed securitizations and reports its findings to the corresponding bodies.
5.3 Key metrics. 
Grupo Santander’s strong capital position is consistent with our business model, balance sheet structure, risk profile and regulatory requirements. Our strong balance sheet and profitability enables us to finance growth and continue to accumulate capital.
Our model of subsidiaries with autonomy over liquidity and capital allows us to mitigate the risk that one subsidiary experiencing difficulties could affect others. Our capital metrics are stable, as ratios remain comfortably above the regulatory requirements and are consistent with senior management-approved risk appetite.

Responsible Corporate Economic and Risk management Contents banking governance financial review and compliance 6. Operational risk 6.1 Introduction. 
In accordance with the Basel framework, Santander defines “operational risk” as the risk of loss due to inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or to external events. It covers fraud, technological risk, cyber risk, legal 37 and conduct risk.
Operational risk is inherent in all products, activities, processes and systems. It is generated in all business and support areas. All employees are responsible for managing and controlling the operational risks generated by their activities.
Our operational risk (OR) management and control model is based on a continual process of identifying, evaluating and mitigating sources of risk (regardless of whether they have materialized), ensuring that risk management priorities are established appropriately.
6.2 Operational risk management. 
Grupo Santander’s operational risk management is based on the following elements:
Management and control model Santander’s operational risk model establishes the elements needed to manage and control operational risk properly according to advanced regulatory standards and best management practice. Its phases are: • strategy and planning; • identification, measurement and monitoring of risks and internal controls; • implementation and monitoring of mitigation measures; and • disclosure, proper reporting and escalation of relevant matters.
Operational risk management in Grupo Santander is underpinned by the following items: • Internal events database: registry of operational risk events whose impact could be financial (e.g. losses, regardless of their amount) or non-financial (i.e. relating to regulation, customers or services). This information: ◦ enables the analysis of root causes; ◦ increases the awareness of risks for better operational risk management; ◦ enables the escalation of relevant operational risk events to senior risk executives in the shortest time possible; ◦ facilitates regulatory reporting; and ◦ facilitates the economic capital model within the internal capital adequacy assessment process (ICAAP).
• Operational risk and control self-assessment (RCSA): a qualitative process that evaluates each area´s operational risks and assesses the control environment based on the opinion of experts from each function. Its purpose is to identify, assess and measure material operational risks that could prevent the business or support units from achieving their objectives. After assessing risks and internal controls, mitigating measures for risk levels above tolerance are identified.
Our RCSA integrates specific reviews that allow to identify cyber, technology, fraud, third party supplier and other risk drivers that could lead to operational risk as well as the failure to meet regulations. In addition, the RCSA incorporates reviews related to conduct and financial crime risk (for more details, see section 7.2 'Compliance and conduct risk management').
• External event database: quantitative and qualitative information about external operational risk events. The database facilitates detailed and structured analysis of relevant events in the industry; the comparison of the Group and subsidiaries’ loss profile; as well as the preparation for RCSA exercises, insurance and scenario analysis.
• Operational risk scenario analyses: identifies highly unlikely events that could result in significant losses for Santander, and establishes appropriate mitigating measures based on the assessment and opinion of experts from business lines and risk managers.
• Key risk indicators: indicators that provide quantitative information about Santander’s risk exposure and control environment. The most significant indicators related to main risk exposure are part of operational risk appetite.
• Risk appetite, which has the following structure: ◦ a global non-financial risk appetite statement, which asserts Santander’s commitment to controlling and limiting: nonfinancial risk events that can or will result in financial losses; fraud events; operational and technological incidents; legal and regulatory infractions; issues associated with conduct; or reputational damage. While some losses are expected, high severity unexpected losses resulting from failed controls are not acceptable. This statement is associated with our loss and control environment metrics.
◦ statements regarding technological risk, cyber risk, cloud, fraud, money laundering, product sales, regulatory compliance, model risk and supplier risk management, each with their own forwardlooking monitoring metrics.

• Economic capital model: a loss distribution approach (LDA) model that captures Grupo Santander’s operational risk profile, with information collected from the internal loss database, external data and scenarios. It is mainly used to determine operational risk economic capital and estimate expected and stressed losses for operational risk appetite.
• Other specific instruments are used to analyse and manage operational risk; assess new products and services; manage business continuity plans (BCP); review and revise perimeters; and run quality assurance reviews.
Our management and reporting system for operational risk, Heracles, supports the operational risk programme and tools with a Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC) approach. It provides information for management and reporting at subsidiaries and throughout the group. Heracles facilitates better operational risk management decisions by consolidating information, preventing duplication and simplifying reporting. To achieve this, we ensure that employees can have a timely, full and precise view of their risks by using a common set of taxonomies and methodological standards.
Implementing the model and initiatives In 2021, we enhanced our operational risk model by: • enhancing the risk appetite framework: establishing new metrics (inclusion of new internal control metrics and of a qualitative statement regarding cloud risk in risk appetite for 2022); and improving defined thresholds and measurements; • developing models used to conduct an independent assessment of our risk profile and control environment to assist subsidiaries in their oversight and help to challenge the accuracy of local assessments; • improving and progressing with our holistic risk assessment programme, in which each specialist second line monitors and contrasts the principal risks that are integrated within non-financial risks; • improvements in the process to determine, identify and assess reference risks and standard controls with the objective of strengthening and ensuring consistency of our risk and control environment; • establishing initiatives to assess climate risk as related to operational risk within our management model; • improving the assessment methodology of the global cyber security transformation plan to identify and measure the reduction in risk due to the implementation of new information security developments; • improvements to contingency, business continuity and crisis management plans, in coordination with the recovery and resolution plans, while also hedging emerging risks; and • developing the methodology to analyse and assess transformation risk, with an approved operating model.
Operational resilience and business continuity plan (BCP) Digital transformation is revolutionizing how banks operate, presenting new business opportunities. At the same time this structural change is also giving rise to new emerging risks such as technology risk, cyber risk and an increased dependency on third party suppliers, which increase the potential exposure to events that could affect the provision of services to our clients.
We are also witnessing changes in regulation that are increasingly focused on the importance of Operational Resilience, such as in the recently published Basel Principles for Operational Resilience; in the policy statement and final rules, Building the UK Financial Sector’s Operational Resilience, by Bank of England (BoE), the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA); and in the EU's Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA). In particular, these regulations require banks to strengthen their ability to recover from disruptive events that could have an impact on their core business operations.
Grupo Santander is firmly committed to maintaining a robust control environment according to the best standards in the banking industry. This allows us to reinforce our operational resilience against potential disruptive events thus ensuring the provision of services to our customers as well as ensuring systemic stability.
A major pillar of our operational resilience is our business continuity management system (BCMS), which ensures the continuity of our business processes in all our subsidiaries in the event of a severe incident or disaster. It is a holistic management process that identifies potential threats and their impact to our operations and resources as well as defines the proper protocols and governance in order to provide an effective response. Its main objectives are: • safeguarding people's safety in a contingency situation; • guaranteeing that core functions are performed, and service is delivered to our customers; • fulfilling our obligations towards employees, customers, shareholders, and other stakeholders; • to comply with regulatory requirements; • to minimize potential losses to Grupo Santander as well as the impact on business activities; • to safeguard the bank’s reputation and credibility, as well as our client’s confidence in the bank; • to reduce the effects of an incident by ensuring efficient procedures, priorities, and strategy for the recovery and restoration of business operations in a contingency situation; and • contribute to a stable financial system.
The pandemic challenged the business continuity plan frameworks and strategies of our subsidiaries. While we did have to adapt some protocols, the crisis has demonstrated that Santander has a robust BCMS. In 2021, we continued to enhance and revise our BCMS incorporating conclusions and lessons learned from the management of the pandemic. In particular: • revision of the scope and extent of the critical processes that should be considered in the definition and determination of business continuity strategy and plans (especially for prolonged contingencies);

Responsible Corporate Economic and Risk management Contents banking governance financial review and compliance • reinforcement of infrastructure and protocols to establish the possibility of remote working as a valid and effective strategic alternative within continuity plans; • mandatory risk assessments and cost-benefit analyses in order to select the necessary continuity strategies for each contingency scenario identified; • implementation of flexible solutions (such as robotics and the digitization of documents) in order to be able to respond quickly to the needs of our customers and business units during a contingency; • development of a methodology and tool to manage and monitor the maturity level of subsidiary business continuity programmes.
In addition, we have formed a multidisciplinary working group led by the non-financial risk function in order to review the risk identification and management frameworks that are currently in place. The objective of the working group is to ensure proper coverage of the new Operational Resilience regulatory requirements.
Relevant mitigation actions Grupo Santander continuously implements and monitors mitigation actions for major sources of risk identified by internal management tools and other external sources of information.
Fraud The transformation and digitalization of the business has given rise to new risks and threats, such as more payment scams and credit fraud (fraud in origination). To mitigate these risks, we enhanced control mechanisms and designed new products. Strong customer authentication processes, in line with the EU’s Payment Service Directive (PSD2), such as biometric validation (e.g., facial recognition) in customer onboarding and enhancing anti-fraud alerts in origination are becoming increasingly widespread to mitigate fraud risk.
To reduce fraud, Grupo Santander applies special measures in some geographies, such as: • Card fraud: ◦ Generalized use of chip and PIN (transactions with chip cards that require a numeric verification code) for all transactions in ATMs and stores, with advanced authentication mechanisms between ATMs, points of sale and Grupo Santander’s systems.
◦ Continuously improved card protection against e-commerce fraud, with a secure standard (3D Secure) via two-step authentication based on one-time passwords, mobile applications that enable card deactivation for e-commerce transactions, or virtual cards issuance with dynamic authentication passwords.
◦ Use of a new biometric authentication system in ATMs and branches in Santander Brazil. Customers could use their fingerprint to withdraw cash from ATMs.
◦ Continuous integration of monitoring and fraud detection tools with internal and external systems for better detection of suspicious activity.
◦ Reinforced ATM security with new physical protection and antiskimming elements, as well as improved logical security of devices.
• Online/mobile banking fraud: ◦ Online banking transaction verification with a second security factor of one-time passwords. The evolution of technologies differ across geographies, e.g., the use of QR codes generated from transactional data.
◦ Continuous improvements to online banking security with a transaction scoring system that assigns transactions a risk level, which trigger additional authentication when a given security threshold is breached.
◦ Implementation of specific mobile banking protections, such as identification and registration of customer devices.
◦ Monitoring of the e-banking platform security to avoid systems attacks.
• Forgery and identity theft fraud: ◦ Enhanced fraud controls that verify the applicant’s identity and the device used to submit the request.
◦ Implementation of biometrics for customers and employees.
◦ Transfer of the credit fraud prevention function to the Credit Risk area for enhanced mitigation of fraud in origination as well as strengthening of alerts.
◦ New management and authentication platforms.
Cyber risk In 2021, cyberthreats were more frequent and stronger, as hackers continued to enhance their capabilities. This is a trend that is expected to continue in coming years and the financial sector will remain a primary target. This trend as well as Santander's increasing reliance on digital systems, make cyber risk one of the top nonfinancial risks for the business.
Therefore, our objective is to make Santander a cyber resilient organization that can withstand, detect and rapidly react to cyberattacks, while constantly evolving and improving our defences. We continue to enhance our cyber security controls, policies, and procedures according to our global cyber security framework and international best practices.
During 2021, several key strategic cyber security pillars and initiatives, described on section 5. Research, development & innovation (R&D&I) of Economic & Financial Review chapter, have been established to help Santander evolve its cyber defences in line with emerging threats and technologies.
In the second line of defence, the cybersecurity risk team developed and implemented a cyber risk management and control framework that assesses and evaluates the cyber risk profile and control environment of the bank. The main focal points have been: • approval and implementation of an operating model that drives and steers the second line of defence cyber-risk function. The model provides a structured approach and enables effective and proactive risk management. It establishes the mission, principles, procedures, tools and required skills for cyber risk management; • implementation of a holistic procedure across all second line functions to regularly measure and assess the cyber security control environment and risk profile. The assessment has been.

Creation of an automated tool enabling cyber risk data correlation, analysis and reporting, significantly reducing information gathering and consolidation to enable prioritization of risk management activities; • establishment of group-wide governance to verify that subsidiaries have properly implemented the operating model and to ensure consistency of the risk control tools and procedures implemented across our footprint.
For more details on cyber security, see section 5 'Research, development and innovation (R&D&I)'.
IT risk The process of digital transformation as well as Santander’s mission to become the best open financial services platform requires that we constantly review, assess and improve our controls to mitigate and manage IT risk. Along these lines, the risk analyses that we perform on key transformation initiatives help us understand and escalate, as necessary, to senior management the risk profile of these initiatives in terms of inherent and residual risks.
Despite a demanding environment that is constantly changing, we have quickly adapted our technology to meet the new needs of our customers as well as meet new regulatory requirements. It is important to note that, even with the current digital transformation, total IT incidents at Group level have continued their downward trend in comparison with figures from previous years. For 2021 key aspects of our IT Risk Management programme are summarized below: • The adoption of a risk-based approach to ensure we prioritize the necessary resources and corrective actions taking into consideration the criticality of our IT assets. These critical assets have corresponding risk appetite metrics that are used to monitor the level of IT risk in areas such as availability, obsolescence, and the application of security patches. We have made significant progress on reducing the level of obsolescence in key IT assets in all subsidiaries.
• As with cyber risk, we have developed and implemented an automated tool that enables IT risk data correlation, analysis, and reporting. This tool has facilitated information gathering and consolidation to enable the prioritization of risk management activities, allowing for more efficient supervision and oversight of IT risk.
• Detailed analyses of the most relevant IT risks as identified in our RCSA to gain an in-depth understanding of these risks, and ensure appropriate mitigation plans.
• The issuance of a new IT risk supervision and oversight policy that establishes common protocols and standards for the monitoring and controlling of IT risks, in conjunction with functional and governance aspects.
Supplier management Our digitalization strategy sets out to offer our customers the best solutions and products in the market. This can entail an increase in third-party services and the use of new technologies such as cloud. In light of the increase in cyber risks and regulatory requirements, we continue to update and strengthen our supplier risk management model, internal control framework, and risk culture to properly assess and manage the risks in outsourcing and third-party agreements. 
In 2021, we adopted a risk-based approach that focused on those suppliers, in the different entities of the Group, that could increase the potential risk level in our operations and client services. We have implemented enhanced monitoring of those suppliers to ensure: • they present an appropriate control environment in accordance with established Group policies and with the risk level of the service provided; • business continuity plans are in place to guarantee the delivery of the service even in the event of a disruption; • the proper controls are in place to guarantee the protection of information processed during the provision of service; • contracts and third party agreements include the required clauses to protect the interests of the Group and our customers, while providing coverage of the legal obligations in force; • regular monitoring of these providers is carried out, with particular attention to the monitoring of service level agreements and to the regular testing of the provider’s business continuity plans; and • exit strategies are defined, including reversion or migration plans, particularly for those services with a high impact on business continuity and complex substitution.
We began the implementation of a new certification process to ensure our suppliers follow the same ESG sustainability standards and criteria. Santander has defined ESG sustainability as integral to our way of operating and doing business.
Lastly, we revised our supervision methodologies and tools to enhance the monitoring of third-party risk in our subsidiaries.
Other key mitigating actions We are constantly improving our risk mitigation measures related to customer, products, and business practices. Santander has specific frameworks and policies on the marketing and selling of products and services; customer complaint handling and analysis; financial crime prevention; and compliance with new regulations.

Insurance in operational risk management Santander considers insurance to be a key component in the management of operational risk. The Own Insurance function is responsible for the use of risk transfer formulas to optimize and safeguard the bank´s financial results. The Own Insurance function, in collaboration with non- financial Risk (NFR), performs the continuous oversight and supervision of entities across the Group to ensure the proper application of policies and procedures to manage risk that is insurable. This collaboration is governed by: • NFR participation as a permanent member in the quarterly Own Insurance forum.
• NFR attendance of the quarterly Claims forum, which monitors and enhances processes for loss recovery via insurance.
• Procedures outlining the interaction model between NFR and Own insurance, as well as other functions that correspond to the various insurance typologies (e.g. Facilities, Legal, etc.). These procedures ensure the proper management of insurance throughout the entire process of identification, assessment, transfer, and retention of risk.
• the coordination on an annual basis of the mapping of risks to insurance across the Group, with the objective of monitoring the effectiveness of insurance coverage, and identifying and correcting any potential gaps in coverage.
We continue to adapt the use of insurance to align our management with changes in the risk environment. As a result, we have expanded our analysis and implemented coverage related to climate-related risk, the digital environment, and other elements. To respond to these and other transversal risks, Santander has global insurance programmes for property damage, general civil liability, fraud, expenses arising from cyber security breaches, and third-party claims against directors and officers of the Group (D&O insurance). These global policies are complemented by local insurance policies that adapt to the characteristics of each subsidiary and are purchased according to the Own Insurance risk management model implemented in each geography.
Analysis and monitoring of controls in Santander Corporate & Investment Banking In 2021, SCIB maintained normal activity and its robust internal control environment without major incidents. Preventative measures related to the pandemic continued to be applied and were consistent with recommendations by local authorities.
Given the nature, specificity and complexity of financial markets, SCIB improves operational risk management and control on a continuous basis. The following enhancements were implemented in 2021: • Continued to monitor the risk of unauthorized trading via a specific risk appetite metric that measures the periodic assessment of key risk mitigation controls. Global guidelines were updated with new requirements. We continued to strengthen the control framework by performing the regular review of controls, as well as incorporating reports to facilitate the holistic supervision and monitoring of markets’ activity.
• Increased incident and risk surveillance to make resolution quicker and operational risk mitigation measures more effective.
• Continued to enhance processes and drive the operational excellence of services provided to our customers by reinforcing a culture of quality and promoting the best standards in all SCIB geographies.
• Strengthened the governance and oversight of third-party risk management through the creation of a specialized function within the division to mitigate the risks inherent in our business.
• Advanced the maturity of the control framework that covers cyber security risks with special focus on the risks related to data leaks, vulnerability management (ransomware), identity management and access control.
• Continuous improvement of the control model related to regulatory requirements such as MiFID II, the Dodd-Frank Act, EMIR, IFRS 9, GDPR and other regulations.

Responsible Corporate Economic and Risk management Contents banking governance financial review and compliance 7. Compliance and conduct risk 7.1 Introduction. 
According to our three lines of defence model, the Compliance and Conduct risk function is an independent control function within the second line of defence. It reports directly and periodically to the Board of Directors and its committees through the Group Chief Compliance Officer (GCCO).
The Compliance and Conduct function, as the second line of defence, will facilitate critical and independent debate. It will also exercise oversight and control of the first line of defence's management of regulatory compliance, product governance and consumer protection, financial crime compliance, and reputational risk. Additionally, it will ensure that risks are managed in accordance with the risk appetite formulated by senior management while assessing the impact on our risk appetite and risk profile.
The responsibility of the second line of defence includes the obligation to inform the relevant governance bodies when necessary, of risks, risk appetite and risk excesses. It should adopt and promote a common risk culture and provide guidance, advice and expert judgment on all relevant matters relating to compliance and conduct business.
The compliance program is one of the key processes of the compliance and conduct risk function and details the main activities to be developed throughout the year. The parent company and each of the subsidiaries execute a compliance program appropriate to their size and complexity which is structured around the four management areas mentioned above, being a key tool that enables the supervision of our subsidiaries and the control environment.
7.2 Compliance and conduct risk management. 
The compliance and conduct risk ensures compliance with the General code of conduct (“GCC”) under the supervision of the compliance and the risk supervision, regulation and compliance committees. The GCC dictates the ethical principles and conduct rules that must govern our employees’ work. It is to be understood and applied along with all other internal regulation. It sets out: • compliance functions and duties; • the Group’s general ethical principles; • the general rules of conduct; • the consequences for failure to comply; • an ethical channel (Canal Abierto) to report possible misconduct in a confidential and anonymous manner.
Regulatory Compliance The Regulatory compliance function monitors and controls regulatory risk from employees, data processing and market regulations (together with SCIB’s compliance team). Its core areas are:
A. Employees The Regulatory compliance function promotes a culture of ethics and compliance among our employees. It sets internal standards to prevent criminal risks, conflicts of interest and anti-competitive practices according to the GCC. It also manages Canal Abierto.
To enhance the Group’s compliance system, in 2021 the function launched in our core units a competition law programme based on international standards and best practices from competition authorities. Its main elements are “Tone from the top”, policies, training, awareness, identification of risk areas, risk domains, controls, Canal Abierto and disciplinary proceedings. It helped us reduce risk from failure to comply with competition regulation while tightening our monitoring and awareness so employees could recognize and report breaches.
This year: • we updated mandatory employee training, with a message from senior management (Expanding “Tone from the top” is key to the cultural transformation needed for the programme to be successful).
• We enhanced our methodology for measuring competition risk.
• We drafted conduct guidelines so employees can recognize and report risk situations and seek advice from our Legal and Compliance areas.

Financial Crime Compliance (FCC) Financial crimes are universal, globalised phenomena that take advantage of the international economy, and thus their detection, deterrence and disruption call for a coordinated global response by the international community and the financial sector. Santander Group is wholly committed to the fight against financial crime and does not tolerate compliance failures with financial crime regulations both internationally and in the countries in which it operates.
The business functions within the Group maintain the primary responsibility for managing financial crime risk and to support and promote the organization's risk culture. The FCC Function in turn is responsible for monitoring and overseeing financial crime risks and for ensuring adequate policies and procedures have been implemented to manage the business within the Group's established risk appetite.
In 2021, the Board of Directors approved an expanded FCC Corporate Framework, which establishes: • The principles that must be adhered to by entities of the Group in relation to the prevention of financial crime; • The roles and responsibilities for effective financial crime risk management; • The key FCC processes to be developed and embedded within the entities of the Group in compliance with the Group policies and procedures that must be adopted locally; and • The essential features of FCC governance at a Corporation and local level.
Under this expanded FCC Corporate Framework, the scope of financial crime related risk includes not only money laundering, terrorist financing, and the violation of international sanctions programmes, but also bribery, corruption, tax evasion and external fraud, as well as any other priority criminal activity reportable under AML/CFT regulation.
The Group has significantly advanced the FCC strategic transformation plan over 2021, initially defined in 2020, designing a bank-wide FCC target operating model that reaffirms the role of the business functions in assuming responsibility and accountability for managing financial crime risk. The strategic transformation plan continues to work toward the centralization of key FCC controls along with their maintenance and calibration. The transformation plan embraces the responsible use of automation, artificial intelligence and machine learning, and the use of reliable third-party data sources, all to improve financial crime risk management, enhance the customer experience, and give the business the necessary risk management tools to continue to pursue financial inclusion initiatives.
The on-going implementation of the FCC strategic transformation has relied on a series of successes over 2021, including: • The transposition of enhanced policies and procedures, tracking control implementation on a country-by-country, control-bycontrol basis; • The establishment of a legal framework that will facilitate over the long-term inter-group information sharing; • Continued intensive subsidiary oversight to ensure country-bycountry advancements on key FCC pillars; • The addition of new members to the FCC Corporate Forum, increasing the representation of accountable stakeholders from the business functions; • And regular key risk indicator reporting and an annual FCC risk and controls self-assessment exercise, paired with a risk-pro culture that encourages self-identified issues and the identification of risk events.
Highlights over 2021 in key activities include: 221 150,343 subsidiary reviews disclosures to authorities (+3% vs. 2020) (+64% vs. 2020) 315,512 164,547 investigations conducted employees trained. 
In addition, the FCC Function implemented over 2021 a significant FCC upskilling training initiative in line with the expanded FCC corporate framework. Further, following a series of successful group-wide awareness sessions in 2020, over 2021 the FCC introductory training module was fully redesigned to highlight, for example, risks associated with crypto-assets, compliance challenges faced in designing innovative digital products, trends in responding to complex international sanctions regimes, and awareness on drug trafficking, human trafficking and online child sexual exploitation risks, and environmental crime.
The Group continues to play a leading role in key industry groups and public-private initiatives, including as a founding member of the Wolfsberg Group, a representative on the Europol Financial Intelligence Public Private Partnership (EFIPPP) Steering Group, a member of the United for Wildlife Financial Taskforce, a member of the European Banking Federation, and a frequent contributor to private sector consultations from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). Notably in 2021 the Santander FCC Function was asked by the FATF to represent the private sector in an awareness-raising webcast on environmental crime, and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) named the Santander FCC function as the chair of the UNODC’s quarterly Private Sector Dialogue on Disruption of Financial Crimes Related to Forestry Crimes.
Reputational risk Santander classifies reputational risk as the risk of loss due to damage to the bank’s reputation among employees, customers, shareholders, investors and broader society. It may come from various sources or even other risks relating to business and support operations; the economic, social and political climate; and events involving our competitors.
Our reputational risk model is based on a preventive risk management and control approach, with effective handling of early warnings and monitoring of events and detected risks. This requires regular update and review of the Group’s risk appetite and preventative risk management and control.

Responsible Corporate Economic and Risk management Contents banking governance financial review and compliance 8. Model risk 8.1 Introduction. 
A model is a system, approach or method that makes quantitative estimations based on statistical, economic, financial or mathematical theories, techniques or assumption about data. Its simplified representations that contrast real and observed trends help Grupo Santander focus on specific aspects. In particular, we use models for approval (scoring/rating), capital calculation, behaviour, provisions, market risk, operational risk, compliance and liquidity.
Models risk is the risk of loss from inappropriate, inaccurate or misused models in decision-making. Sources of model risk can be: • incorrect or incomplete data in the model itself or the modelling method used in systems; • incorrect use or implementation of the model.
Model risk can prompt financial loss, poor commercial and strategic decision-making or damage to Grupo Santander’s transactions.
We have been defining, managing and controlling model risk for several years. The Model Risk function has been enhanced and consolidated across corporate and our core subsidiaries.
To ensure adequate model risk management, we have a set of policies and procedures that establish the principles, obligations and procedures for organizing, governing, managing and approving models throughout their life cycle.
We monitor model risk according to each model’s level of importance. Through tiering, we synthesize the level of importance of non-regulatory models and determine how intense risk management should be. As regulatory models are particularly important to Grupo Santander, we subject them to more intense monitoring and management.
We implemented our multi-year Model risk management (MRM) 2.0 strategy to manage model risk better according to regulatory standards (e.g. ECB guide to internal models, 2018). Upon concluding in 2021, MRM 2.0 included several initiatives that strengthened our Model risk function, such as: • Streamlining: It helped us take risk-driven measures to simplify processes involving regulatory model management and other important operations for the Group.
• Regulatory models (IRB and IMA): To fulfil regulatory requirements and the EBA’s new guidelines, we scaled back our mapping of regulatory credit risk model portfolios.
• Validation: We continued to reinforce the Single Validation Office, which guarantees consistent and well-coordinated validation of the Group’s models.
• Model risk facilitators: We made additional improvements to our infrastructure and tools and helped spread the model culture across the Group. Real-time information from advanced digitalization enhanced decision-making.
In addition to MRM 2.0, we have made further progress on the two regulatory credit risk and market risk model projects under way that focus on the targeted review of internal models (TRIM), internal model inspections (IMIs) and compliance with new regulation.
Our main aim will be to keep building up our IRB and IMA management in line with ECB requirements for 2022, especially the new EBA Repair Programme due to take effect in January. In 2021, we submitted several model changes to the ECB for authorization, which entails a lengthy review that will carry on into 2022 and require the Model risk function’s full cooperation. We anticipate sending additional model changes to the ECB in the coming years.
8.2 Model risk management. 
Model risk management and control are structured processes known as the model life cycle and consist of the following phases in Santander:
Identification Model risk control must include identified models. For sound management, a complete inventory of models in use is key.
Our centralized inventory system, which has uniform taxonomy and detailed information for all the models that business units use, enables us to monitor them closely according to their level of importance and tiering.

Responsible Corporate Economic and Risk management Contents banking governance financial review and compliance. 
Planning This is an internal annual exercise, approved by our subsidiaries’ governance bodies and validated by the global team. It formulates strategic measures for models managed by the Model risk function and pinpoints needs for any models to be created, revised or used during the year.
Development Development is the model-building phase. It is based on econometrics and run by methodology experts. Model development considers each unit’s needs in line with the annual model plan.
To guarantee model quality and consistency, it must apply the common group-wide methodology formulated by the global team. Models & Data unit aims to make model development a more efficient and more centralized process that builds on shared synergies.
More detail see section 2.5 'Models & Data Unit' of this chapter.
Internal validation. 
Independent model validation is a regulatory requirement and key feature of our model risk management. A specialist unit that is totally independent from developers and users issues technical assessments of internal model suitability. The validation opinion for each model is expressed through a rating that summarizes the model risk associated to it. Validation intensity and frequency are welldefined and risk-driven.
Validation covers theory, methodology, technological systems and data quality to ensure effectiveness. It also involves a detailed analysis of model performance and other risk management elements (e.g. controls, reporting, uses and senior manager involvement).
One internal validation task is the consistency analysis conducted by validators to review the severity and ratings. It acts as an important point of control to ensure the homogeneity and comparability of validation tasks.
Validation tasks only conclude after the consistency analysis phase. The Single Validation Office also plays an important role to ensure consistent validation of the Group’s models.
Approval Before we can use a model, internal governing bodies must approve it through a governance circuit in place for our model inventory, based on their level of importance.
Deployment and use In this phase, newly developed models are added to computer systems. Because this creates another source of model risk, technical teams and model owners must run tests that verify proper model integration based on methodology and intended function.
Monitoring and control We must regularly review models to ensure that they function correctly or, otherwise, adapt and redesign them. Model risk monitoring teams must make sure models are managed according to the general model risk framework and internal rules and principles.

Responsible Corporate Economic and Risk management Contents banking governance financial review and compliance 9. Strategic risk 9.1 Introduction. 
Strategic risk is the threat of loss due to poor strategic decisions or their deficient implementation that affect our core stakeholders’ medium-to-long-term interests or to an inability to adapt to a changing environment.
Because Grupo Santander’s business model is pivotal to strategic risk, it has to be viable and sustainable and should produce results in accordance with the Group’s annual targets (particularly the next three years) and long-term outlook.
Strategic risk has three components:
Business model risk, which includes the risk that the 1 Group's model will become obsolete or irrelevant; or that it will lose value and not produce desired results.
Strategy design risk, which relates to the strategy and 2 assumptions set out in Grupo Santander’s long-term plan (including the risk that the plan will not be up to par), which could result in a failure to deliver expected results.
Strategy execution risk, which involves the three-year 3 financial plan; internal and external impacts; the inability to react to changes in the business environment; and risks associated with corporate development transactions.
9.2 Strategic risk management. 
Grupo Santander views strategic risk as a cross-sectional risk and has a target operating model that our subsidiaries use as a reference. The model covers the governance, procedures and necessary tools for robust monitoring and control according to the board-approved risk appetite statement.
We constantly monitor changes in competition, regulation and market conditions as well as within the bank to determine whether we need to revise our strategy and verify any mitigating factors and resolution plans in place. The strategic risk function engages key first- and second-line teams to make sure measures are primed for immediate implementation in case they are needed.
In 2021, the main strategic focus was to see how economic recovery fared against the uncertainty fuelled by new covid-19 variants and progress of global vaccination campaigns and especially in our markets. We also continued to monitor the progress of our transformation projects, which are key to meeting our objectives. Our proactive and effective response to business challenges meant our strategic risk profile was once again medium-low.
While our long-term strategy remains valid, our success is increasingly dependent on our customer focus (i.e. “think customer”). Boosting our revenue, profitability and value hinge on increasing customer numbers, loyalty and satisfaction.
Our strategic risk model is based on: • Challenging strategic plans: With the support of specialized functions within the Risk division, the Strategic Risk function challenged the three-year financial plan, including a specific chapter in the final plan that identifies potential threats and changes in the environment that could jeopardize strategic objectives. In 2021, we closely monitored the key digital transformation projects that underpin our plan: One Santander (common operating model), PagoNxt and Digital Consumer Bank.
• Top risks: Under stressed scenarios, Grupo Santander identifies, measures, monitors and manages risks that could have a significant impact on results, liquidity or capital.
The first and second line of defence work with our subsidiaries to identify top risks, which are also added to idiosyncratic scenarios in exercises like ICAAP, ILAAP and the Group's viability and recovery plans.
For more details on top risks, see section 1.3 'Santander Top and emerging risks' of this chapter.
• Analysing business model performance: To measure and identify the main threats to the bank’s business plan and strategic objectives, based on four pillars that bring together retrospective and prospective analyses.
◦ Strategy execution (retrospective): Measurement of the risk of deviation from the plans and targets set in the board-approved strategy and strategic and transformation initiatives, which are deemed crucial to addressing strategic priorities.
◦ Viability and sustainability (prospective): Measurement of the risk that the business model will fail to create shareholder value or will perform poorly. We also assess the bank’s position in relation to competitors.
◦ Business plan volatility (retrospective): Measurement of the risk that our income statement planning is unstable and that profits will not be recurrent in the long term.
◦ Likelihood of meeting strategic objectives (prospective): Risk of failing to achieve the strategic objectives set in the financial plan, based on the threats uncovered in the top risks exercise.
• The strategic risk and corporate development and strategy functions prepare the strategic risk report to measure and monitor the strategy and its risks. It is presented to senior management and includes an update on strategy execution, strategic projects, corporate development transactions, business model performance, top risks and the risk profile.
• Commercialization of new products: The strategic risk function helps assess and validate new product and service proposals before Grupo Santander launches them, ensuring alignment with the approved strategy.
• Corporate development transactions: With the support of other functions within the Risk division, the strategic risk function makes sure risk assessments are carried out on the impact of these transactions on our risk profile and risk appetite.

Responsible Corporate Economic and Risk management Contents banking governance financial review and compliance 10. Climate and environmental risk 10.1 Introduction. 
Climate-related and environmental risk management is key to fulfilling our objectives and the commitments in our climate strategy sustainably. Santander takes aiding customers’ and households’ transition to a low-carbon economy seriously, offering financial products and services to environmentally and socially responsible businesses in keeping with our sustainability commitments and the objectives of the Paris Agreement. For more details, see the Responsible banking chapter.
Santander has an environmental, social and climate change risk policy (available on its corporate website). It dictates the standards for measuring, monitoring and managing risks from oil and gas, power generation, mining and metals, soft commodities and other sectors that require in-depth analysis because of their potential 10.2 Climate-related and environmental risk management. 
Climate-related and environmental risk management is a priority of the Risk function. The graph below sums up how we’ve been integrating it within core processes and risk cycle phases (more details in the sections below).
impact on the environment and society. It is consistent, and must be applied, with the Group's policies on sustainability and human rights.
The Risk and Responsible banking functions oversee the annual revision of the policy alongside other business areas to make sure it will conform to international practices and standards and to the Group's sustainability strategy.

Responsible Corporate Economic and Risk management Contents banking governance financial review and compliance. 
Identification Two core processes help Santander spot climate-related risks: top and emerging risk identification (see section 1.3 'Santander Top and emerging risks') and regular risk profile assessment — RPA — (see section 2.4 'Management processes and tools' ). Here is how they form part of climate-related risk management.
In identifying emerging and top risks, we pinpoint and measure our most significant internal and external threats to profitability, capital adequacy and strategy. Since 2018, our four top risk event categories have included a climate and environment subcategory. Our analysis covers qualitative as well as quantitative factors (which we’ve been. 
Climate Risk Type Climate Drivers developing further as more data and new methodologies become available).
As the Group makes progress on its climate-related commitment, it shows us how the importance of climate-related and environmental risks and the mounting pressures from regulators, supervisors and broader society have grown in recent years. The table below shows certain climate matters that could influence the types of risks within our framework over various time horizons. Santander deems climate-related and environmental risk a cross risk, as climate drivers could influence other risks.
Main affected Time Horizon → Change in consumer behaviours including deliberate move to more sustainable products. 
Market & Customers → Potential loss of competitive advantage with our green product proposition or pricing risks Short - Medium Term → Increased market volatility and cost, sourcing restrictions for carbon heavy raw materials. 
Policy-Making → More demanding policy environment affecting our customer's business operations → Increased green house gas (GHG) emissions pricing to foster movement to renewable sources. 
Short - Medium - Long Term. 
Technology & Data → Investment in technology to reduce emissions or improve energy efficiency ratings → Lack of procedures and systems to obtain and store reliable data for risk assessments and disclosure. 
Medium Term. 
Transition Risk Regulatory Pressure → New public disclosure products which increase the risk of misrepresentation, increased regulatory requirements which increases the potential of non-compliance, increased use of external analytics providers which increases the potential for data privacy breaches, all of which could result in fines, payment of damages and the voiding of contracts → Increasingly demanding banking regulation (disclosure, stress testing, taxonomies, etc)
Short - Medium Term → Inefficiencies as consequence of different climate regulations, with special attention in those financial entities with international scope. 
Reputational → Risk of slow, lack or not sufficient reaction from financial entities impacting its reputation; extreme events that would cause damages to financial entities and employees own sites could challenge, if readiness response plans fail, the ability of the banks to prompt react to restoration of service and customers attention in vulnerable situations due to the damages → Increased scrutiny from different stakeholders (e.g. supervisors, regulators, media, NGO's, shareholders, investors, etc) → Perceived not to be meeting, sufficiently progressing, or providing transparency on climate-related commitments and transitioning → Liability implications as an intermediary in several value chain (e.g. data, products, financial services) → Reputational impact from potential misalignment of emissions reduction commitments with performance in specific portfolios. 
Short - Medium Long Term → More frequent and severe climate events such as flooding, drought, etc, that could affect financed assets and the value of the collaterals Short - Medium - Long Term Acute → Alterations in weather patterns and stability of local ecosystems affecting food production and living environment.
→ Rising temperatures affecting working conditions, living conditions and local infrastructure.
→ Rising sea levels affecting local ecosystems, increasing subsidence and flood risks. 
Physical Risk Chronic Long Term.

Findings from emerging and top risk identification fuel our internal capital and liquidity adequacy assessment processes (ICAAP and ILAAP). For instance, our 2021 ICAAP included an idiosyncratic event to show climate change's potential impact on measurement.
The risk profile assessment (RPA) is the second topic of this section. Santander regularly conducts an RPA that covers all risk types and reveals any threat to its business plan. In 2021, we added a special module on climate-related risk control to measure the Corporate Centre and the other subsidiaries'’ progress. The questionnaire covers strategic planning, implementation, control and monitoring, and governance. Its findings enable us to find gaps and areas for improvement. The questionnaire will continue to change throughout 2022.
Planning Strategic planning includes annual budgeting, the three-year financial plan (including risk in executing the Group's strategy, internal and external influence, inability to respond to a changing business environment) and the Group's long-term strategic plan (including risk from its own design).
Those core strategic processes enable the Group to plan for risks from the transition to a low-carbon economy and the physical impact of climate change, and introduce them into short-, medium- and long-term strategy, making it easier to spot threats and changing conditions that could influence our ability to deliver objectives. In qualitative and group-wide terms, plans cover priorities and projects for the coming years; in quantitative terms, they include a financial plan for the period that is consistent with the Group's risk appetite.
Assessment To determine the most significant climate-related and environmentally material loan portfolios, Santander runs a quarterly materiality assessment. It proves fundamental to making decisions about selected industries, customers and regions and to establishing our strategic priorities. It covers climate-related and environmental risks over many time horizons so our management processes (e.g. risk appetite, top risk identification, credit limits and stress testing) can address them.
Our risk taxonomy and heatmaps are the basis for categorizing portfolios by industry and region according to their potential exposure to physical or transition-based climate-related and environmental risk. Santander’s materiality assessment follows the guidelines of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and the United Nations Environmental Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP-FI).Because the taxonomy of industries and subindustries is based on the EU’s NACE codes, it enables us to consistently compile exposure data that serve as a starting point (along with the heatmap for physical and transition-based risks) for quantitative and qualitative measurements of the most material climate change-related risks.
It covers practically our entire balance sheet. It also analyses residual value, strategic risk, market risk and liquidity risk in depth. In 2021, we continued making progress with our climate-related risk materiality assessment by raising the level of granularity and including other businesses (namely Santander Consumer Finance and Private Banking). The graph below shows the Group's last materiality assessment at the end of Q3’21.

Monitoring Santander uses risk appetite, scenario analyses and other tools to monitor climate-related and environmental risk. Here we delve deeper into each one.
Risk appetite sets the volume and type of risks we deem prudent for our business strategy. Along with implementing policies, it is a key tool to monitor climate-related risk, our objectives and our commitments, and to mitigate the risk of failing to meet them.
Climate-related matters have been expressly part of our risk appetite since 2019. The board of directors approved a qualitative risk appetite statement on climate. It linked climate change management to our industry-related policies, which prohibit or place restrictions on financing operations with an environmental or social impact in the energy, mining and metals, and soft commodities industries. We review those policies every year to make sure our standards remain consistent with our strategy and best practice.
In line with our ambition and commitment to financing the transition to a low-carbon economy, in November 2020 the Group updated our risk appetite consistently with our support for the Paris Agreement while our industry-based policies were combined into our environmental, social and climate change policy.

In February 2021, the Group made its first decarbonization commitments as part of its goal to reach net zero emissions by 2050. They included commitments on the thermal carbon industry. Accordingly, by 2030 we will end financial services to electricity generating customers if 10% of their revenues rely on thermal coal; and eliminate our exposure to coal mining worldwide.
We continue to enhance our risk appetite statement to complement the Group’s strategy with available methodologies and data. To start setting climate-related risk appetite metrics, we determine industry targets according to our strategy and follow this conceptual process:
Design options: Calibration and metrics, data Policy and Approval definition of limits Monitoring availability and procedure analysis government thresholds frequency. 
According to our first decarbonization commitments, our current qualitative risk appetite statement added a specific quantitative metric the board had approved in November 2021 in accordance with established governance procedures.
The metric puts limits and thresholds on counterparties from the thermal carbon industry that our commitments concern. It also gives a path to those limits that is conducive to fulfilling the target by 2030. The process involves permanent contact with affected customers to share Santander’s strategy and to understand and assess their transition planning.
Santander will also continue to set alignment targets for industries with a material impact on climate as part of the Net Zero Banking Alliance initiative. The Group's risk appetite will gradually introduce metrics and limits for each one of those industries (subject to established governance procedures).
As mentioned earlier, scenario analyses are a management tool to monitor climate-related and environmental risk. Analysis techniques are useful for the Group's internal management and for handling regulatory and supervisory stress testing. We use scenarios determined by the network for greening the financial system (NGFS) and others designed by our Research department to analyse the impact on climate under various circumstances.
In 2022, Santander will undergo the Single Supervisory Mechanism’s (SSM) climate and environmental risk stress test. It will have three modules: a qualitative questionnaire; climate risk metrics; and bottom-up stress test projections. Although it may be qualitatively introduced into the Supervisory review and evaluation process (SREP), it is an overall learning exercise without direct quantitative implications about capital. To carry it out, the Group will use a combination of internally developed items and an external provider’s platform and databases to quantify the financial impact of each counterparty’s physical and transition-based risks. According to the graph below, the platform has seven modules and is based on the United Nations Environmental Programme Finance Initiative's (UNEP FI) methodology and other external information. The exercises we conduct entail both a bottom-up analysis of the customer and a topdown analysis of portfolios by industry and geography.

Furthermore, Santander UK took part in the Bank of England’s Climate Biennial Exploratory Scenario (CBES) in 2021. The CBES marks the first time Santander UK conducted an analysis of climate scenarios in what became a learning exercise. That enables us to measure the dimension of our portfolios’ climate change-related risks and understand the challenges involved.
The CBES required three scenario models exploring many combinations of physical and transition-based risks over 30 years. It also required closer contact with customers to better understand their plans to adapt to climate change and reflect them in final risk models. Focus was on credit risk and, in particular, on detailed analyses of risks to large corporates.
In response to the CBES, Santander UK set out its target operating model, created internal climate-related risk models, engaged with providers specializing in climate modelling, obtained internal and market data to include them within models, and involved hundreds of employees and customers. Its CBES exercise followed a sound governance and control framework. We expect the Bank of England will publish its findings in May 2022.
Mitigation In mitigation, we updated our environmental, social and climate change policy, which sets out our public commitments and aims to support our strategy for sensitive, special-attention and prohibited industries. Our loan approval policies follow the EBA's guidelines on loan origination and monitoring.
Our internal taxonomy is also considered a mitigating instrument since it helps us inform our customers of the need to have credible plans in place to cease carbon-based activities in the coming years and ensure an orderly transition. The sustainable finance classification system (SFCS) is our internal guide to identify sustainable activities and ensures a blanket approach to monitoring operations, supporting the development of solutions for customers and mitigating the risk of greenwashing. It is also key to designing our sustainable financing proposition and supplements our Global sustainable bond framework and Green finance commitment.
Furthermore, for credit approvals, the first line of defence runs due diligence with several special questionnaires. If the process reveals a reputational issue, it will be escalated to the Reputational risk team as a preventative measure. All project finance transactions with SCIB must be analysed according to the Equator Principles (for more details about Santander’s commitment to the Equator Principles, see section ‘Environmental and social risk analysis’ in the Responsible banking chapter).
For 2022, we have planned several measures to continue including climate and environmental variables in credit approvals: • Credit committees: Subsidiary committees will inquire about environmental, social and climate change factors.
• Customer ratings: They aim to ensure all SCIB corporate ratings include environmental, social and climate change factors. We will broaden the scope to retail banking (corporates). Environmental, social and climate change analysis is gradually being introduced into pricing based on companies’ ratings. However, pricing for green mortgages and other special products already provides discounts under certain conditions.
• Collateral: Collateral valuation includes energy certificates.
A corporate multidisciplinary working group is analysing and monitoring the most significant claims and disputes, including those related to climate change management that could have an impact on Santander’s reputation. Its work includes mitigation plans and escalations according to the established governance.
Santander takes part in international regulatory and supervisory forums and working groups to assess climate risks and opportunities, while anticipating and mitigating potential risks to the Group.
Lastly, the Risk function increased the number and capabilities of its resources to manage and monitor climate and environmental risk, for which specialist training proved fundamental. Furthermore, we will gradually give most employees general training in 2022 to raise their awareness. Our Risk pro culture will be essential. In 2022, we also hope to progress our policy on incentives/remuneration tied to climate-related risk management and control.
Reporting Santander continues to make progress on internal and external disclosures to ensure communications to stakeholders on climate and environmental risk progress are transparent and accurate according to the law and supervisors’ expectations.
Our external reports such as the 2021 Climate finance report (that explains Santander’s position and strategy on climate change) and this Annual report highlight the progress we made climate and environmental risk. We are also working on areas that are closely related to external disclosures such as the green asset ratio (GAR), transparency requirements of the sustainable finance disclosure regulation (SFRD) and climate disclosure requirements under Pillar III. Because of the increasing interest in, and scrutiny of, climate and environmental risk, information on climate-related and environmental risk is becoming more important to the Group’s senior managers.

Auditor's Consolidated Notes to the consolidated Contents report financial statements financial statements Appendix. 
Banco Santander, S.A., and Companies composing Grupo Santander Notes to the consolidated financial statements (consolidated annual accounts) for the year ended 31 December 2021 1. Introduction, basis of presentation of the consolidated financial statements (consolidated annual accounts) and other information a) Introduction Banco Santander, S.A. ('the parent' or 'Banco Santander'), is a privatelaw entity subject to the rules and regulations applicable to banks operating in Spain, where it was constituted and currently maintains its legal domicile, which is paseo de Pereda, numbers 9 to 12 (39004, Santander, Spain).
The principal headquarters of Banco Santander are located in Ciudad Grupo Santander, Avenida Cantabria s/n (28660, Boadilla del Monte, Madrid, Spain).
The corporate purpose of Banco Santander, S.A., mainly entails carrying out all kinds of activities, operations and services inherent to the banking business in general and permitted by current legislation, and the acquisition, holding, enjoyment and disposal of all kinds of securities.
In addition to the operations carried on directly by it, Banco Santander is the head of a group of subsidiaries that engage in various business activities and which compose, together with it, Grupo Santander ('Santander' or 'the Group'). Therefore, Banco Santander is obliged to prepare, in addition to its own separate financial statements, the Group's consolidated financial statements, which also include the interests in joint ventures and investments in associates.
At 31 December 2021, Grupo Santander consisted of 721 subsidiaries of Banco Santander, S.A. In addition, other 172 companies are associates of the Group, joint ventures or companies of which the Group holds more than 5% (excluding the Group companies of negligible interest with respect to the fair presentation that the annual accounts must express).
Grupo Santander consolidated financial statements for 2019 were approved by the shareholders at the group´s annual general meeting on 3 April 2020. Grupo Santander consolidated financial statements for 2020 were approved by the shareholders at the group´s annual general meeting on 26 March 2021. The Group's 2021 consolidated financial statements, the financial statements of the parent and of substantially all the Group companies have not been approved yet by their shareholders at the respective annual general meetings. However, Banco Santander board of directors considers that the aforementioned financial statements will be approved without any significant changes.
b) Basis of presentation of the consolidated financial statements Under Regulation (EC) n.º 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 July 2002 all companies governed by the law of an EU Member State and whose securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market of any Member State must prepare their consolidated financial statements for the years beginning on or after 1 January, 2005 in conformity with the International Financial Reporting Standards ('IFRS') previously adopted by the European Union ('EU-IFRS').
In order to adapt the accounting system of Spanish credit institutions with the principles and criteria established by the IFRS adopted by the European Union ('EU-IFRS'), the Bank of Spain published circular 4/2017, dated 27 November 2017, on Public and Confidential Financial Reporting Standards and Financial Statement Formats.
During 2021 and 2020, the Bank of Spain published Circulars 6/2021 of 22 December, 2/2020 and 3/2020 of 11 June, amending Circular 4/2017 of 27 November to credit institutions on Public and Confidential Financial Reporting Standards and Financial Statement Formats.
Grupo Santander consolidated financial statements for 2021 were authorised by the Bank's directors (at the board meeting on 24 February 2022) in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union and with Bank of Spain circular 4/2017 and subsequent modifications, and Spanish corporate and commercial law applicable to the Group, using the basis of consolidation, accounting policies and measurement bases set forth in note 2, accordingly, they present fairly the Group's equity and financial position at 31 December 2021, 2020 and 2019 and the consolidated results of its operations and the consolidated cash flows in 2021, 2020 and 2019. These consolidated financial statements were prepared from the accounting records kept by the Bank and by the other Group entities, and include the adjustments and reclassifications required to unify the accounting policies and measurement bases applied by the Group. These consolidated annual accounts have been prepared on the basis of the accounting records held by the Bank and by each of the other companies of the Group, and include the adjustments and reclassifications required to standardise the accounting policies and valuation criteria applied by Grupo Santander.
The notes to the consolidated financial statements contain additional information to that presented in the consolidated balance sheet, consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of recognised income and expense, consolidated statement of changes in total equity and consolidated statement of cash flows. The notes provide, in a clear, relevant, reliable and comparable manner, narrative descriptions and breakdowns of these statements.

Auditor's Consolidated Notes to the consolidated Contents report financial statements financial statements Appendix. 
Adoption of new standards and interpretations issued The following modifications came into force and were adopted by the European Union in 2021: • Amendments to IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures, IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts and IFRS 16 Leases, on Reference Interest Rates - Phase 2: The amendments allow for the temporary application of certain exceptions to the requirements of (i) assessment of derecognition of financial assets, financial liabilities and lease liabilities in the event of changes in the financial assets, financial liabilities and lease liabilities, and (ii) exemptions from hedge accounting requirements directly affected by the IBOR reform, requiring additional disclosures, (iii) exemptions for lease modifications that allow the liability to be measured using the reformed interest rate curves against the right-of-use. These new exemptions require additional disclosures. The amendments became effective as of 1 January 2021, with the possibility of early application and will cease to be applicable when the uncertainties about the hedged risks, cash flows of the financial instruments affected or the hedging relationship is terminated. In this regard, the Group chose to apply the amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 in the preparation of the financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2020.
The additional breakdowns required by the amendments to IFRS 7 relating to hedging relationships are included in note 36. A description of the Grupo Santander's management of the transition to alternative reference rates, as well as the changes in risk management strategy is included in note 53.
Following is a detail of the carrying amount at 31 December 2021 of financial assets, financial liabilities, derivatives and loan commitments that continue to be referenced to the indices subject to the IBOR Reform:

Auditor's Consolidated Notes to the consolidated Contents report financial statements financial statements Appendix • Amendment to IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts, which is aimed at extending the expiry date of the temporary exemption from applying IFRS 9 by two years (from 1 January 2021 to 1 January 2023) for entities whose activities are predominantly insurancerelated. This achieves alignment with the effective date of IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts (1 January 2023). It is applicable from 1 January 2021.
The application of the aforementioned amendments to accounting standards and interpretations did not have any material effects on Grupo Santander consolidated financial statements.
Likewise, at the date of approval of these consolidated annual accounts, the following standards which effectively came into force have effective dates after 31 December 2021: • Amendment to IFRS 3 Business Combinations: to update the references to the Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting and add an exception for the recognition of liabilities and contingent liabilities within the scope of IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets and IFRIC 21 Levies. The amendments also confirm that an acquirer should not recognize contingent assets acquired in a business combination. It will apply from 1 January 2022.
• Amendment to IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment: prevents an entity from deducting from the cost of an item of property, plant and equipment any revenue from the sale of finished goods while the entity is preparing the item for its intended use. It is also clear that an entity is "testing whether the asset is functioning properly" when evaluating the technical and physical performance of the asset. The financial performance of the asset should not be taken into account for this evaluation.
Additionally, entities should disclose separately the amounts of income and expenses related to finished goods that are not the product of the entity's ordinary activities. It will apply from 1 January 2022.
• Amendment to IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets: clarifies that the direct costs of fulfilling a contract include both the incremental costs of fulfilling the contract and an allocation of other costs directly related to fulfilling contracts. Before recognising a separate provision for an onerous contract, the entity recognises any impairment loss that has occurred on assets used in fulfilling the contract. It will apply from 1 January 2022.
• Amendment to IFRS Cycle (2018-2020): introduces minor amendments, to be applied from 1 January 2022, with early application permitted, to the following standards: • IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: clarifies which rates must be included in the 10% test for derecognition of financial liabilities.
• IFRS 16 Leases: amendment to remove possible confusion regarding the treatment of leasing incentives in the application of IFRS 16 Leases.
• IFRS 1, in relation to the first-time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, allows entities that have measured their assets and liabilities at the carrying amounts recorded in their parent's books to also measure any cumulative translation differences using the amounts reported by the parent. This amendment also applies to associates and joint ventures that have adopted the same exemption from IFRS 1.
• IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts: new general accounting standard for insurance contracts, which includes the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of information. Insurance contracts combine financial and service provision features that, in many cases, generate variable long-term cash flows. To properly reflect these characteristics, IFRS 17 combines the measurement of future cash flows with the recording of the result of the contract during the period in which the service is provided, presents separately the financial results from the results for the provision of the service and allows entities, through the choice of an accounting policy option, to recognize the financial results in the income statement or in other comprehensive income. It will apply from 1 January 2023.
In addition, during 2021, although it is still pending adoption by the European Union a transitional option relating to comparative information presented on financial assets in the initial application of IFRS 17, which is intended to help entities avoid temporary accounting mismatches between the financial assets and liabilities of insurance contracts, has been included during 2021 but is still pending adoption by the European Union. It will apply from 1 January 2023.
Grupo Santander is still analysing the possible effects of this new standard, however, it should be noted that no material impacts on the consolidated financial statements of Grupo Santander have been identified as a result of its application, except for certain balance sheet reclassifications arising from the different treatment that this new standard establishes for the components of an insurance contract.
Finally, at the date of approval of these consolidated annual accounts, the following standards which effectively come into force after 31 December 2021 had not yet been adopted by the European Union: • Classification of Liabilities, amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements, considering non-current liabilities those in which the entity has the possibility of deferring payment for more than 12 months from the closing date of the reporting period.
They must be applied retrospectively in accordance with the normal requirements in IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors. It will apply from 1 January 2023.
• The amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements require companies to disclose material information about their accounting policies rather than their significant accounting policies. It will be applicable from 1 January 2023.
• The amendments to IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors clarifies how to distinguish changes in accounting policies, which are generally applied retrospectively, from changes in accounting estimates, which are generally applied prospectively. It will be applicable from 1 January 2023.
Annual report 2021 543


 

 

 

 

 

 
Auditor's Consolidated Notes to the consolidated Contents report financial statements financial statements Appendix • The amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes require companies to recognise deferred tax on transactions that, on initial recognition, give rise to equal amounts of taxable and deductible temporary differences. In addition, entities should recognise deferred tax assets (to the extent that it is probable that they can be utilised) and deferred tax liabilities at the beginning of the earliest comparative period for all deductible and taxable temporary differences associated with: • Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, and • Decommissioning, restoration and similar liabilities, and the corresponding amounts recognised as part of the cost of the related assets.
The cumulative effect of recognising these adjustments is recognised in retained earnings, or another component of equity, as appropriate. It will be applicable from 1 January 2023.
Grupo Santander is currently analysing the possible effects of these new standards and interpretations.
All accounting policies and measurement bases with a material effect on the consolidated financial statements for 2021 were applied in the preparation of these consolidated annual accounts.
c) Use of critical estimates The consolidated results and the determination of consolidated equity are sensitive to the accounting policies, measurement bases and estimates used by the directors of the Bank in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
The main accounting policies and measurement bases are set forth in note 2.
In the consolidated financial statements estimates were occasionally made by the senior management of Grupo Santander in order to quantify certain of the assets, liabilities, income, expenses and obligations reported herein. These estimates, which were made on the basis of the best information available, relate basically to the following: • The impairment losses on certain assets: it applies to financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income, financial assets at amortised cost, non-current assets held for sale, investments, tangible assets and intangible assets (see notes 6, 7, 10, 12, 13, 16, 17, 18 and 53).
• The assumptions used in the actuarial calculation of the postemployment benefit liabilities and commitments and other obligations (see note 25).
• The useful life of the tangible and intangible assets (see notes 16 and 18).
• The measurement of goodwill arising on consolidation (see note 17).
• The calculation of provisions and the consideration of contingent liabilities (see note 25).
• The fair value of certain unquoted assets and liabilities (see notes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 20, 21 and 22).
• The recoverability of deferred tax assets and the income tax expense (see note 27).
• The fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed in business combinations (see note 3).
To update the estimates described above, the Group's Management has taken into account the current situation as a result of covid-19, classified as a pandemic by the World Health Organization, which significantly is affecting the economic activity worldwide and, as a result, the Group's operations and financial results, and which generates uncertainty in the Group's estimates. Therefore, the Group's Management has made an assessment of the current situation according to the best information available to date, disclosing in the notes the main estimates made and the potential impacts of covid-19 on them for the period ended 31 December 2021 (see notes 17, 27 and 53).
Although these estimates have been made on the basis of the best information available at the end of the year 2021, and considering information updated at the date of preparation of these consolidated annual accounts, it is possible that events that may take place in the future may make it necessary to modify them (upwards or downwards) in the coming years, which would be done, if appropriate, in a prospective manner, recognising the effects of the change in estimate in the corresponding consolidated income statement.
d) Information relating to 2020 and 2019 In July 2016, the IASB published IFRS 16, Leases, which was adopted by the Group in accordance with the standard on 1 January 2019. IFRS 16 establishes the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and breakdown of lease contracts, with the objective of ensuring reporting information that faithfully represents the lease transactions.
The adoption of IFRS 16 led to changes in the Group's accounting policies for the recognition, measurement, presentation and breakdown of lease contracts. As a result of its adoption , the impact of the first application recorded by Grupo Santander corresponds, mainly, to the recognition of right-of-use for an amount of EUR 6,693 million, financial liabilities for an amount of EUR 7,084 million and a negative impact on the Group's equity of EUR 391 million. The impact of the first application of IFRS 16 on the ordinary capital ratio (Common Equity Tier 1 - CET 1) was -20 bp.
Secondly, Grupo Santander chose to apply in advance for the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2019 the amendment to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 on Reference Interest Rates (IBOR Reform - Phase 1). Grupo Santander applies IAS 39 for hedge accounting, detailed below are the main assumptions or judgments made by Grupo Santander when applying the amendments to that standard.
– For cash flow hedges, the Group has assumed that the cash flows covered (which are based on the benchmark index) are not modified as a result of the aforementioned reform, and therefore continue to comply with the highly probable future transaction requirement.
– To determine the prospective effectiveness of hedges, the Group has assessed that the economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument continues to exist since the interest rate benchmark on which the hedged item and the hedging instrument are based is not changed as a result of the IBOR reform.
See information regarding Phase 2 of that Reform in section b of this note and in note 53.

Auditor's Consolidated Notes to the consolidated Contents report financial statements financial statements Appendix. 
Additionally, the segment information corresponding to the year ended 31 December 2020 and 2019 were restated for comparative purposes in accordance with the Group's new organizational structure, as required by IFRS 8 (see note 51).
In addition to the above, the information in note 4.b relating to the shares outstanding in 2019 has been restated due to the capital increase done in 2020 described in note 31.a in accordance with IAS 33 Earnings per Share.
Finally, based on the meeting held on 3 March 2020 by the International Financial Reporting Standards Committee (IFRIC), the Group has changed its accounting policy in relation to the presentation of exchange differences and the effects of hyperinflation of the operations generated in Argentina with retroactive effect (see note 2.a.iv).
Therefore, the information contained in these consolidated financial statements for the financial years 2020 and 2019 is presented solely and exclusively for comparative purposes with the information relating to the year ended 31 December 2021 (see note 2.a.iv).
In order to interpret the changes in the balances with respect to 31 December 2021, it is necessary to take into consideration the exchange rate effect arising from the volume of foreign currency balances held by Grupo Santander in view of its geographic diversity (see note 51.b) and the impact of the appreciation/depreciation of the various currencies against the euro in 2021, based on the exchange rates at the end of 2021: Mexican peso (5.55%), US dollar (8.34%) , Brazilian real (0.85%) , Argentine peso (-11.30%), Sterling pound (6.91%), Chilean peso (-9.61%), and Polish zloty (-0.82%); as well as the evolution of the comparable average rates: Mexican peso (1.60%), US dollar (-3.52%), Brazilian real (-8.75%), Argentine peso ( -8.21%), Sterling pound (3.43%), Chilean peso (0.55%) and Polish zloty (-2.70%).
e) Capital management i. Regulatory and economic capital Credit institutions must meet a number of minimum capital and liquidity requirements. These minimum requirements are governed by the European Capital Requirements Regulation, better known as CRR, and the Capital Requirements Directive, CRD. In June 2019, these regulations were significantly amended. The applicable regulations are now CRR II and CRD V.
As the Directives need to be transposed into the legal systems of the different Member States in order to be applicable, in the case of Spain, Royal Legislative Decree 7/2021 and Royal Decree 970/2021 were published for this purpose in 2021.
In June 2019, CRR II introduced the minimum TLAC (Total Loss Absorbing Capacity) requirement, which only applies to global systemically important banks (G-SIBs). This requirement introduces two metrics: i) a minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities as a percentage of the Total Risk Exposure Amount (TREA) set at 16% during the transition period and 18% from 1 January 2022 after the end of the transition period; and ii) a metric to set a minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities as a percentage of the Total Risk Exposure Amount of 6% during the transition period and 6.75% from 1 January 2022 after the end of the transition period.
This year saw the implementation of the EBA Guidelines on the Definition of New Default, which were prepared in accordance with CRR II, on 1 January 2021. The changes to CRR II that are applicable from June 2021 include the introduction of a minimum leverage ratio of 3%, the new standardised EAD calculation for counterparty risk, known as SA-CCR, the long-term liquidity ratio (NSFR), the new limits for large exposures and the requirement to report under the standardised approach for market risk.
The CRD V introduces important modifications such as the regulation of Pillar 2G ('guidance', orientation of requirements by Pillar 2).
On 27 October 2021, the European Commission published the draft review of European banking legislation: CRR III and CRD VI.
The banking package consists of the following elements: 1) Implementation of the final Basel III reforms, 2) Contribution to sustainability and green transition and 3) Stronger supervision: ensuring sound management of EU banks and better protection of financial stability.
In general, the Commission proposes to start applying the new rules from 1.1.2025, but the amendments to the regulation that concern resolution issues could come into force in the first months of 2022.
With regard to the resolution rules, institutions must have an adequate funding structure to ensure that, in the event of financial distress, the institution has sufficient liabilities to absorb losses in order to recover its position or be resolved, while ensuring the protection of depositors and financial stability.
The directive that governs the resolution framework mentioned above is the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD). Like the CRR and the CRD, the BRRD was amended in June 2019, so BRRD II refers to all of these amendments. The transposition of this directive into the Spanish legal system took place in 2021 through a Royal Decree.
BRRDII has introduced important changes to the Minimum Requirement for Own Funds and Eligible Liabilities (MREL). For example, the TLAC requirement is now considered a Pillar 1 resolution requirement for G-SIBs. For large banks (defined as banks with total assets of more than EUR 100 billion) or banks deemed systemically important by the resolution authority, BRRDII sets a minimum subordination requirement of 13.5% of risk-weighted assets or 5% of the leverage ratio, whichever is higher. For all other institutions, the subordination requirement is set by the resolution authority on a case-by-case basis.
Finally, Deposit Guarantee Schemes (DGS) are regulated by Directive 2014/49 or DSGD, which has not undergone any significant changes since its publication in 2014. It aims to harmonise the deposit guarantee schemes of the Member States, thus ensuring stability and balance in the different countries. It creates an appropriate framework for depositors to have better access to DGSs than was the case before the publication of this Directive through clear coverage, shorter repayment periods, better information and robust funding requirements. This Directive is transposed into Spanish law by Law 11/2015, Royal Decree 1012/2015 and Royal Decree 1041/2021.

Auditor's Consolidated Notes to the consolidated Contents report financial statements financial statements Appendix. 
In 2020, the national governments took measures to address the economic and social impact of the vine population, in particular legislative moratoria that were aimed at containing NPLs and helping the population to meet liquidity needs. Throughout 2020, the EBA adopted a series of guidelines, including the Guidelines on legislative and non-legislative moratoria applied in the context of the Cov19 crisis on 2 April 2020 (EBA/GL/2020/08). These guidelines clarified the requirements for public and private moratoria to avoid classification of exposures affected by moratoria as forborne exposures.
Although these guidelines were initially going to apply to moratoria granted before 30 June 2020, the EBA decided on 2 December 2020 to reactivate the application of these guidelines (EBA/GL/2020/02) for moratoria requested before 31 March 2021 and for a period not exceeding 9 months.
Another measure adopted in 2020 to provide flexibility in meeting the requirements was the approval and entry into force of the CRR "Quick Fix" amending CRR II (urgent and extraordinary amendments to bring about a more flexible regulatory framework in response to COVID-19). The Quick Fix introduces a number of new features, including the extension of the transitional period granted before the pandemic for the entry into force of IFRS 9, due to the sudden and significant increase in expected credit loss provisions to be recognised. The implementation of certain provisions of CRR II has also been delayed, such as those relating to the leverage ratio buffer (postponed until 1 January 2023); the possibility of excluding exposures to central banks from the calculation of the leverage ratio, which should have been applied from June 2021 on, has been brought forward. Other provisions beneficial to institutions have also been brought forward. These include the support factors for SMEs and infrastructure, and the new treatment for software (applicable from the day following the publication date of the Delegated Regulation that implements it).
At 31 December 2021 Grupo Santander met the minimum capital requirements established by current legislation (see note 53d).
ii. Plan for the roll-out of advanced approaches and authorisation from the supervisory authorities Grupo Santander continues adopting, over the next few years, the advanced internal ratings-based (AIRB) approach under Basel II for substantially all its banks. The commitment assumed before the supervisor still implies the adoption of advanced models within the ten key markets where Santander Group operates.
This objective of covering IRB models in the group should be seen in the context of the current supervisory focus on the robustness and adequacy of existing models, as well as the simplification strategy recently agreed with the ECB.
Grupo Santander has obtained authorisation from the supervisory authorities to use the AIRB approach for the calculation of regulatory capital requirements for credit risk for the Parent and the main subsidiaries in Spain, the United Kingdom and Portugal, as well as for certain portfolios in Germany, Mexico, Brazil, Chile, the Nordic countries (Norway, Sweden and Finland), France and the United States.
As regards the other risks explicitly addressed under Basel Pillar I, the Group is authorised to use its internal model for market risk for its treasury trading activities in Spain, Chile and Mexico.
For the purpose of calculating regulatory capital for operational risk, the Group uses the standardised approach provided for the CRR. In 2017 the European Central Bank authorised the use of the Alternative Standardised Approach to calculate the capital requirements at consolidated level in Banco Santander México, S.A., Institución de Banca Múltiple, Grupo Financiero Santander México, in addition to the approval obtained in 2016 in Brazil.
f) Environmental impact In view of the business activities carried on by the Group entities, the Group does not have any environmental liability, expenses, assets, provisions or contingencies that might be material with respect to its consolidated equity, financial position or results.
Grupo Santander considers the aspects related to climate change in the preparation of the ratings of its wholesale clients if they are relevant. These ratings influence the subsequent assignment of credit parameters for the calculation of the expected loss' estimate.
With the reasonable and supportable information available at the date of approval of these consolidated annual accounts, the potential additional impacts of expected losses on the time horizons of the Group's portfolios, taking into account as well the mitigation measures, are not considered material.
Grupo Santander, together with the rest of the financial industry, is working on developing the appropriate methodologies to improve the measurement of these losses, when the necessary regulatory developments are more advanced and information is available to carry out a more precise measurement.
See additional information in note 53.a.

Auditor's Consolidated Notes to the consolidated Contents report financial statements financial statements Appendix 2. Accounting policies. 
The accounting policies applied in preparing the consolidated financial statements were as follows: a) Foreign currency transactions i. Presentation currency Banco Santander’s functional and presentation currency is the euro. Also, the presentation currency of the Group is the euro.
ii. Translation of foreign currency balances Foreign currency balances are translated to euros in two consecutive stages: ▪ Translation of foreign currency to the functional currency (currency of the main economic environment in which the entity operates).
▪ Translation to euros of the balances held in the functional currencies of entities whose functional currency is not the euro.
Translation of foreign currency to the functional currency Foreign currency transactions performed by consolidated entities (or entities accounted for using the equity method) not located in European Monetary Union (“EMU”) countries are initially recognised in their respective currencies. Monetary items in foreign currency are subsequently translated to their functional currencies using the closing rate.
Furthermore: ▪ Non-monetary items measured at historical cost are translated to the functional currency at the exchange rate at the date of acquisition.
▪ Non-monetary items measured at fair value are translated at the exchange rate at the date when the fair value was determined.
▪ Income and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates for the year for all the transactions performed during the year. When applying this criterion, the Group considers whether there have been significant changes in the exchange rates in the year which, in view of their materiality with respect to the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, would make it necessary to use the exchange rates at the transaction date rather than the aforementioned average exchange rates.
▪ The balances arising from non-hedging forward foreign currency/ foreign currency and foreign currency/euro purchase and sale transactions are translated at the closing rates prevailing in the forward foreign currency market for the related maturity.
Translation of functional currencies to euros The balances in the financial statements of consolidated entities (or entities accounted for using the equity method) whose functional currency is not the euro are translated to euros as follows: ▪ Assets and liabilities, at the closing rates.
▪ Income and expenses, at the average exchange rates for the year.
▪ Equity items, at the historical exchange rates.
iii. Recognition of exchange differences The exchange differences arising on the translation of foreign currency balances to the functional currency are generally recognised at their net amount under 'Exchange differences, net' in the consolidated income statement, except for exchange differences arising on financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss, which are recognised in the consolidated income statement without distinguishing them from other changes in fair value, and for exchange differences arising on non-monetary items measured at fair value through equity, which are recognised under 'Other comprehensive income–Items that may be reclassified to profit or loss–Exchange differences' (except for exchange differences on equity instruments, where the option to irrevocably elect to be measured at fair value through changes in accumulated other comprehensive income, which are recognised in accumulated 'Other Comprehensive Income - Items not to be reclassified to profit or loss - Changes in fair value of equity instruments measured at fair value' through other comprehensive income (see note 29).
The exchange differences arising on the translation to euros of the financial statements denominated in functional currencies other than the euro are recognised in 'Other comprehensive income–Items that may be reclassified to profit or loss–Exchange differences' in the consolidated balance sheet, whereas those arising on the translation to euros of the financial statements of entities accounted for using the equity method are recognised in equity under 'Other comprehensive income–Items that may be reclassified to profit or loss and Items not reclassified to profit or loss–Other recognised income and expense' of investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates (see note 29), until the related item is derecognised, at which time they are recognised in profit or loss.
Exchange differences arising on actuarial gains or losses when converting to euros the financial statements denominated in the functional currencies of entities whose functional currency is different from the euro are recognised under equity 'Other comprehensive income–Items not reclassified to profit or loss– Actuarial gains or (-) losses' on defined benefit pension plans (see note 29).
iv. Entities located in hyperinflationary economies When a subsidiary operates in a country with hyperinflationary economy, IAS 29 Financial Information in Hyperinflationary Economies is applied, which means that: – Historical cost of non-monetary assets and liabilities and of the various items of equity have to be adjusted to reflect the changes in the purchasing power of the currency due to inflation from their date of acquisition or incorporation into the consolidated balance sheet.
– The different items of the income statement are adjusted by the inflationary index since their generation, with a balancing entry in 'Other comprehensive income'.
– The loss on the net monetary position is recorded in the income for the year against 'Accumulated Other comprehensive income'.
– All components of the financial statements of the subsidiary are translated at the closing exchange rate.

Auditor's Consolidated Notes to the consolidated Contents report financial statements financial statements Appendix. 
The deterioration of the economic situation in Argentina over the last years caused, among other impacts, a significant increase in inflation, which by the end of 2018 had reached 48% per year (147% accumulated in three years). This led the Group to conclude that it was necessary to apply IAS 29 Financial Information in Hyperinflationary Economies to its activities in the country in question in its consolidated financial statements from that year on.
At that moment, according with Group’s accounting policies, exchange differences arising on the translation to the Group´s presentation currency of financial statements denominated in functional currencies other than euro for subsidiaries located in countries with high inflation rates were recorded in the consolidated statement of changes in total 'Equity-Other reserves'.
However, on the basis of the meeting held on 3 March 2020 by the International Financial Reporting Standards Committee (IFRIC), in 2020 Grupo Santander changed its accounting policy with regard to the presentation of exchange differences and the effects of hyperinflation in the operations generated in Argentina, which resulted in a reclassification of EUR -2,136 million at 31 December 2019 for comparability purposes, from the heading "Other reserves" to "Accumulated other comprehensive income", from "Other reserves" to "Accumulated other comprehensive income", corresponding to the accumulated amount of exchange differences related to foreign operations in a hyperinflationary economy and the amount corresponding to the adjustment of the historical cost of the Argentine companies reflecting the changes in the purchasing power of the currency derived from inflation. This change in accounting policy and its consequent restatement between different equity items has no impact on the total equity of Grupo Santander.
In accordance with the provisions of the Argentine Federation of Professional Councils in Economic Sciences (Fcpce), which is the organization that issues the professional accounting standards in said country, the inflation indexes applied are the wholesale internal price index (WPI) until 30 November 2016 and the National Consumer Price Index published by the National Institute of Statistics and Censues (Indec) from 1 December 2016 on. Inflation during 2021 was 50.9%% for the year (36.1% at 31 December 2020). The exchange rate at 31 December 2021 has been of Argentine pesos 116.30 per euro (Argentine pesos 103.16 Argentine pesos per euro at 31 December 2020).
The net impact on Other Comprehensive Income in 2021 of the effects derived from the exchange differences arising on the translation to the Group´s presentation currency of financial statements of the subsidiaries located in Argentina and the application of IAS 29 was a profit of EUR 177 million (loss of EUR 202 million in 2020).
At 31 December 2020, no other country in which the consolidated and associated entities of Grupo Santander are located is considered to have a hyperinflationary economy in accordance with the criteria established in this regard by the International Financial Reporting Standards adopted by the European Union.
v. Exposure to foreign currency risk Grupo Santander hedges a portion of its long-term foreign currency positions using foreign exchange derivative financial instruments (see note 36). Also, the Group manages foreign exchange risk dynamically by hedging its short-term position (with a potential impact on profit or loss) in order to limit the impact of currency depreciations while optimising the cost of financing the hedges.
The following tables show the sensitivity of the consolidated income statement and consolidated equity to percentage changes of ± 1% in the foreign exchange rate positions arising from investments in Grupo Santander companies with currencies other than the euro (with its hedges) and in their results (with its hedges), in which the Group maintains significant balances.
The estimated effect on the consolidated equity attributable to Grupo Santander and on consolidated profit of a 1% appreciation of the euro against the corresponding currency is as follows:
EUR million.

The above data were obtained as follows: a) Effect on consolidated equity: in accordance with the accounting policy detailed in note 2.a.iii, foreign exchange rate impact arising on the translation to euros of the financial statements in the functional currencies of the Group entities whose functional currency is not the euro are recognised in consolidated equity. The potential effect that a change in the exchange rates of the related currency would have on the Group’s consolidated equity was therefore determined by applying the aforementioned change to the net value of each unit’s assets and liabilities -including, where appropriate, the related goodwill- and by taking into consideration the offsetting effect of the hedges of net investments in foreign operations.
Annual report 2021 548


 

 

 

 

 

Auditor's Consolidated Notes to the consolidated Contents report financial statements financial statements Appendix b) Effect on consolidated profit: the effect was determined by applying the up and down movements in the average exchange rates of the year, as indicated in note 2.a.ii (except in the case of Argentina, which is a hyperinflationary economy and has applied the closing exchange rate), to translate to euros the income and expenses of the consolidated entities whose functional currency is not the euro, taking into consideration, where appropriate, the offsetting effect of the various hedging transactions in place.
The estimates used to obtain the foregoing data were performed considering the effects of the changes in the exchange rate in standalone basis not considering the effect of the performance of other variables whose changes would affect equity and profit or loss, such as variations in the interest rates of the reference currencies or other market factors. Accordingly, all variables other than the exchange rate variations were kept constant with respect to their positions at 31 December 2021, 2020 and 2019.
b) Basis of consolidation i. Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are defined as entities over which the Bank has the capacity to exercise control. The Bank controls an entity when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.
The financial statements of the subsidiaries are fully consolidated with those of the Bank. Accordingly, all balances and effects of the transactions between consolidated companies are eliminated on consolidation.
On acquisition of control of a subsidiary, its assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are recognised at their acquisition-date fair values. Any positive differences between the acquisition cost and the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired are recognised as goodwill (see note 17). Negative differences are recognised in profit or loss on the date of acquisition.
Additionally, the share of third parties of Grupo Santander equity is presented under 'Non-controlling interests' in the consolidated balance sheet (see note 28). Their share of the profit for the year is presented under 'Profit attributable to non-controlling interests' in the consolidated income statement.
The results of subsidiaries acquired during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the date of acquisition to year-end. Similarly, the results of subsidiaries for which control is lost during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the beginning of the year to the date of disposal.
At 31 December 2021 Grupo Santander controls a company in which it holds an ownership interest of less than 50% of the share capital, Luri 1, S.A., in liquidation, apart from the structured consolidated entities. The percentage ownership interest in the aforementioned company is 46% (see appendix I). Although Grupo Santander holds less than half the voting power, it manages and, as a result, exercises control over this entity. The company´s corporate purpose for the entity is the acquisition of real estate and other general operations relating thereto, including rental, and the purchase and sale of properties; the company object of the latter entity is the provision of payment services. The impact of the consolidation of this company on the Group's consolidated financial statements is immaterial.
The appendices contain significant information on the subsidiaries.
ii. Interests in joint ventures Joint ventures are deemed to be entities that are not subsidiaries but which are jointly controlled by two or more unrelated entities. This is evidenced by contractual arrangements whereby two or more parties have interests in entities so that decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of all the parties sharing control.
In the consolidated financial statements, investments in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method, i.e. at the Group’s share of net assets of the investee, after taking into account the dividends received therefrom and other equity eliminations. The profits and losses resulting from transactions with a joint venture are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest therein.
The appendices contain relevant information on the joint ventures.
iii. Associates Associates are entities over which Banco Santander is in a position to exercise significant influence, but not control or joint control. It is presumed that Banco Santander exercises significant influence if it holds 20% or more of the voting power of the investee.
In the consolidated financial statements, investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method, i.e. at the Group’s share of net assets of the investee, after taking into account the dividends received therefrom and other equity eliminations. The profits and losses resulting from transactions with an associate are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the associate.
There are certain investments in entities which, although Grupo Santander owns 20% or more of their voting power, are not considered to be associates because the Group is not in a position to exercise significant influence over them. At 31 December 2021 and 2020, this was the situation of the investment in Project Quasar Investments 2017, S.L., despite maintaining a 49% interest in its share capital (see appendix II). The remaining investments are not significant for the Group.
There are also certain investments in associates where the Group owns less than 20% of the voting rights, as it is determined that it has the capacity to exercise significant influence over them. The impact of these companies is immaterial in the Group's consolidated financial statements.
The appendices contain significant information on the associates.
iv. Structured entities. 
When Grupo Santander incorporates entities, or holds ownership interests therein, to enable its customers to access certain investments, or for the transfer of risks or other purposes (also called structured entities since the voting or similar power is not a key factor in deciding who controls the entity), the Group determines, using internal criteria and procedures and taking into consideration the applicable legislation, when control (as defined above) exists and, therefore, whether these entities should be consolidated. Specifically, for those entities to which this policy applies (mainly investment funds and pension funds), the Group analyses the following factors: ▪ Percentage of ownership held by Grupo Santander; 20% is established as the general threshold.
Annual report 2021 549


 

 

 

 

 

Auditor's Consolidated Notes to the consolidated Contents report financial statements financial statements Appendix ▪ Identification of the fund manager, and verification as to whether it is a company controlled by the Group since this could affect Grupo Santander ability to direct the relevant activities.
▪ Existence of agreements between investors that might require decisions to be taken jointly by the investors, rather than by the fund manager.
▪ Existence of currently exercisable removal rights (possibility of removing the manager from his position), since the existence of such rights might limit the manager’s power over the fund, and it may be concluded that the manager is acting as an agent of the investors.
▪ Analysis of the fund manager’s remuneration regime, taking into consideration that a remuneration regime that is proportionate to the service rendered does not, generally, create exposure of such importance as to indicate that the manager is acting as the principal. Conversely, if the remuneration regime is not proportionate to the service rendered, this might give rise to an exposure that would lead the Group to a different conclusion.
These structured entities also include the securitisation special purpose vehicles, which are consolidated in the case of the Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) over which, being exposed to variable yield, it is considered that the Group continues to exercise control.
The exposure associated with unconsolidated structured entities are not material with respect to the Group’s consolidated financial statements.
v. Business combinations A business combination is the bringing together of two or more separate entities or economic units into one single entity or group of entities.
Business combinations whereby Grupo Santander obtains control over an entity or a business are recognised for accounting purposes as follows: ▪ Grupo Santander measures the cost of the business combination, which is normally the consideration transferred, defined as the acquisition-date fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity instruments issued, if any, by the acquirer. In cases where the amount of the consideration to be transferred has not been definitively established at the acquisition date, but rather depends on future events, any contingent consideration is recognised as part of the consideration transferred and measured at its acquisition-date fair value. Moreover, acquisition-related costs do not for these purposes form part of the cost of the business combination.
▪ The fair values of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired entity or business, including any intangible assets identified in the business combination which might not have been recognised by the acquiree, are estimated and recognised in the consolidated balance sheet; the Group also estimates the amount of any non-controlling interests and the fair value of the previously held equity interest in the acquiree.
▪ Any positive difference between the aforementioned items is recognised as discussed in note 2.m. Any negative difference is recognised under 'Negative Goodwill' recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Goodwill is only calculated and recognised once, when control of a business or an entity is obtained.
vi. Changes in the levels of ownership interests in subsidiaries Acquisitions and disposals not giving rise to a change in control are recognised as equity transactions, and no gain or loss is recognised in the income statement and the initially recognised goodwill is not remeasured. The difference between the consideration transferred or received and the decrease or increase in non-controlling interests, respectively, is recognised in reserves.
Similarly, when control over a subsidiary is lost, the assets, liabilities and non-controlling interests and any other items recognised in 'Other Comprehensive income' of that company are derecognised from the consolidated balance sheet, and the fair value of the consideration received and of any remaining equity interest is recognised. The difference between these amounts is recognised in profit or loss.
vii. Acquisitions and sales Note 3 provides information on the most significant acquisitions and sales in the last three years.
c) Definitions and classification of financial instruments i. Definitions A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity.
An equity instrument is a contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the issuing entity after deducting all of its liabilities.
A financial derivative is a financial instrument whose value changes in response to the change in an observable market variable (such as an interest rate, foreign exchange rate, financial instrument price, market index or credit rating), whose initial investment is very small compared with other financial instruments with a similar response to changes in market factors, and which is generally settled at a future date.
Hybrid financial instruments are contracts that simultaneously include a non-derivative host contract together with a derivative, known as an embedded derivative, that is not separately transferable and has the effect that some of the cash flows of the hybrid contract vary in a way similar to a stand-alone derivative.
Compound financial instruments are contracts that simultaneously create for their issuer a financial liability and an own equity instrument (such as convertible bonds, which entitle their holders to convert them into equity instruments of the issuer).

Auditor's Consolidated Notes to the consolidated Contents report financial statements financial statements Appendix. 
The preference shares contingently convertible into ordinary shares eligible as Additional Tier 1 capital (CCPSs) -perpetual shares, which may be repurchased by the issuer in certain circumstances, the interest on which is discretionary, and would convert into variable number of newly issued ordinary shares if the capital ratio of the Bank or its consolidated group falls below a given percentage (trigger event), as those two terms are defined in the related issue prospectuses- are recognised for accounting purposes by the Group as compound instruments. The liability component reflects the issuer’s obligation to deliver a variable number of shares and the equity component reflects the issuer’s discretion in relation to the payment of the related coupons. In order to effect the initial allocation, the Group estimates the fair value of the liability as the amount that would have to be delivered if the trigger event were to occur immediately and, accordingly, the equity component, calculated as the residual amount, is zero. In view of the aforementioned discretionary nature of the payment of the coupons, they are deducted directly from equity.
Capital perpetual preference shares (CPPS), with the possibility of purchase by the issuer in certain circumstances, whose remuneration is discretionary, and which will be amortised permanently, totally or partially, in the event that the bank or its consolidated group submits a capital ratio lesser than a certain percentage (trigger event), as defined in the corresponding prospectuses, are accounted for by the Group as equity instruments. The following transactions are not treated for accounting purposes as financial instruments: ▪ Investments in associates and joint ventures (see note 13).
▪ Rights and obligations under employee benefit plans (see note 25).
▪ Rights and obligations under insurance contracts (see note 15).
▪ Contracts and obligations relating to employee remuneration based on own equity instruments (see note 34).
ii. Classification of financial assets for measurement purposes Financial assets are initially classified into the various categories used for management and measurement purposes, unless they have to be presented as 'Non-current assets held for sale' or they relate to 'Cash, cash balances at central banks and other deposits on demand', 'Changes in the fair value of hedged items in portfolio hedges of interest rate risk (asset side)', 'Hedging derivatives and Investments', which are reported separately.
Classification of financial instruments: the classification criteria for financial assets depends on the business model for their management and the characteristics of their contractual flows.
Grupo Santander business models refer to the way in which it manages its financial assets to generate cash flows. In defining these models, the Group takes into account the following factors: • How key management staff are assessed and reported on the performance of the business model and the financial assets held in the business model.
• The risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held in the business model) and, specifically, the way in which these risks are managed.
• How business managers are remunerated.
• The frequency and volume of sales in previous years, as well as expectations of future sales.
The analysis of the characteristics of the contractual flows of financial assets requires an assessment of the congruence of these flows with a basic loan agreement. The Group determines if the contractual cash flows of its financial assets that are only principal and interest payments on the outstanding principal amount at the beginning of the transaction. This analysis takes into consideration four factors (performance, clauses, contractually linked products and currencies). Furthermore, among the most significant judgements used by the Group in carrying out this analysis, the following ones are included: • The return on the financial asset, in particular in cases of periodic interest rate adjustments where the term of the reference rate does not coincide with the frequency of the adjustment. In these cases, an assessment is made to determine whether or not the contractual cash flows differ significantly from the flows without this change in the time value of money, establishing a tolerance level of 2%.
• The contractual clauses that may modify the cash flows of the financial asset, for which the structure of the cash flows before and after the activation of such clauses is analysed.
• Financial assets whose cash flows have different priority for payment due to a contractual link to underlying assets (e.g. securitisations) require a look-through analysis by the Group so as to review that both the financial asset and the underlying assets are only principal and interest payments and that the exposure to credit risk of the set of underlying assets belonging to the tranche analysed is less than or equal to the exposure to credit risk of the set of underlying assets of the instrument.
Depending on these factors, the asset can be measured at amortised cost, at fair value with changes in other comprehensive income, or at fair value with changes through profit and loss. IFRS 9 also establishes an option to designate an instrument at fair value with changes in profit or loss, when doing so eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency (sometimes referred to as 'accounting asymmetry') that would otherwise arise from measuring assets or liabilities or recognising gains and losses on different bases.
Grupo Santander uses the following criteria for the classification of financial debt instruments: • Amortised cost: financial instruments under a business model whose objective is to collect principal and interest flows, over which there is no significant unjustified sales and fair value is not a key element in the management of these assets and contractual conditions they give rise to cash flows on specific dates, which are only payments of principal and interest on the outstanding principal amount. In this sense, unjustified sales are considered to be those other than those related to an increase in the credit risk of the asset, unanticipated funding needs (stress case scenarios). Additionally, the characteristics of its contractual flows represent substantially a “basic financing agreement”.
Annual report 2021 551


 

 

 

 

 

 
Auditor's Consolidated Notes to the consolidated Contents report financial statements financial statements Appendix • Fair value with changes in other comprehensive income: financial instruments held in a business model whose objective is to collect principal and interest cash flows and the sale of these assets, where fair value is a key factor in their management. Additionally, the contractual cash flow characteristics substantially represent a 'basic financing agreement'.
• Fair value with changes in profit or loss: financial instruments included in a business model whose objective is not obtained through the above mentioned models, where fair value is a key factor in managing of these assets, and financial instruments whose contractual cash flow characteristics do not substantially represent a 'basic financing agreement'. In this section it can be enclosed the portfolios classified under 'Financial assets held for trading', 'Non-trading financial assets mandatorily at fair value through profit or loss' and 'Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss'. In this regard, most of the financial assets presented in the category of 'Financial assets designated at value reasonable with change in results' are instruments financial services that, not being part of the portfolio of negotiation, are contracted jointly with other financial instruments that are recorded in the category of 'held for trading', and that by both are recorded at fair value with changes in results, so your record in any other category would produce accounting asymmetries.
Equity instruments will be classified at fair value under IFRS 9, with changes in profit or loss, unless the Group decides, for non-trading assets, to classify them at fair value with changes in other comprehensive income (irrevocably) at initial recognition.
iii. Classification of financial assets for presentation purposes Financial assets are classified by nature into the following items in the consolidated balance sheet: • Cash, cash balances at Central Banks and other deposits on demand: cash balances and balances receivable on demand relating to deposits with central banks and credit institutions.
• Loans and advances: includes the debit balances of all credit and loans granted by the Group, other than those represented by securities, as well as finance lease receivables and other debit balances of a financial nature in favour of the Group such as cheques drawn on credit institutions, balances receivable from clearing houses and settlement agencies for transactions on the stock exchange and organised markets, bonds given in cash, capital calls, fees and commissions receivable for financial guarantees and debit balances arising from transactions not originating in banking transactions and services, such as the collection of rentals and similar items. They are classified, on the basis of the institutional sector to which the debtor belongs, into: – Central banks: credit of any nature, including deposits and money market transactions received from the Bank of Spain or other central banks.
– Credit institutions: credit of any nature, including deposits and money market transactions, in the name of credit institutions.
– Customers: includes the remaining credit, including money market transactions through central counterparties.
▪ Debt instruments: bonds and other securities that represent a debt for their issuer, that generate an interest return, and that are in the form of certificates or book entries.
▪ Equity instruments: financial instruments issued by other entities, such as shares, which have the nature of equity instruments for the issuer, other than investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures or associates. Investment fund units are included in this item.
▪ Derivatives: includes the fair value in favour of the Group of derivatives which do not form part of hedge accounting, including embedded derivatives separated from hybrid financial instruments.
▪ Changes in the fair value of hedged items in portfolio hedges of interest rate risk: this item is the balancing entry for the amounts credited to the consolidated income statement in respect of the measurement of the portfolios of financial instruments which are effectively hedged against interest rate risk through fair value hedging derivatives.
▪ Hedging derivatives: Includes the fair value in favour of the Group of derivatives, including embedded derivatives separated from hybrid financial instruments, designated as hedging instruments in hedge accounting.
iv. Classification of financial liabilities for measurement purposes Financial liabilities are initially classified into the various categories used for management and measurement purposes, unless they have to be presented as 'Liabilities associated with non-current assets held for sale' or they relate to 'Hedging derivatives' or changes in the fair value of hedged items in portfolio hedges of interest rate risk (liability side), which are reported separately.
In most cases, changes in the fair value of financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss, caused by the entity's credit risk, are recognized in other comprehensive income.
Financial liabilities are included for measurement purposes in one of the following categories: ▪ Financial liabilities held for trading (at fair value through profit or loss): this category includes financial liabilities incurred for the purpose of generating a profit in the near term from fluctuations in their prices, financial derivatives not designated as hedging instruments, and financial liabilities arising from the outright sale of financial assets acquired under reverse repurchase agreements (“reverse repos”) or borrowed (short positions).
▪ Financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss: financial liabilities are included in this category when they provide more relevant information, either because this eliminates or significantly reduces recognition or measurement inconsistencies (accounting mismatches) that would otherwise arise from measuring assets or liabilities or recognising the gains or losses on them on different bases, or because a group of financial liabilities or financial assets and liabilities is managed and its performance is evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented risk management or investment strategy, and information about the group is provided on that basis to the Group’s key management personnel. Liabilities may only be included in this category on the date when they are incurred or originated.
Liabilities may only be included in this portfolio at the date of issue or origination.
▪ Financial liabilities at amortised cost: financial liabilities, irrespective of their instrumentation and maturity, not included in any of the above-mentioned categories which arise from the ordinary borrowing activities carried on by financial institutions.

Auditor's Consolidated Notes to the consolidated Contents report financial statements financial statements Appendix v. Classification of financial liabilities for presentation purposes Financial liabilities are classified by nature into the following items in the consolidated balance sheet: ▪ Deposits: includes all repayable balances received in cash by Grupo Santander, other than those instrumented as marketable securities and those having the substance of subordinated liabilities (amount of the loans received, which for credit priority purposes are after common creditors), except for the debt instruments. This item also includes cash bonds and cash consignments received the amount of which may be invested without restriction. Deposits are classified on the basis of the creditor’s institutional sector into: – Central banks: deposits of any nature, including credit received and money market transactions received from the Bank of Spain or other central banks.
– Credit institutions: deposits of any nature, including credit received and money market transactions in the name of credit institutions.
– Customer: includes the remaining deposits, including money market transactions through central counterparties.
On 6 June 2019, the European Central Bank announced a new program of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III); additionally, the conditions of the initial program were successively modified in the months of March and April 2020, reducing the interest rate by 25 bps to -0.5% from June 2020 to June 2021 and providing that, for banks meeting a certain volume of eligible loans, the interest rate could be -1% for that period. These conditions were extended on December 10, 2020 for the period from June 2021 to June 2022, including the option to cancel or reduce the amount of financing before maturity in windows coinciding with the interest rate review and adjustment periods.
The accounting standards indicate that for the recording of amortized cost the entity 'shall use a shorter period when the fees, basis points paid or received, transaction costs, premiums or discounts relate to it, this being the case when the variable to which the fees, basis points paid or received, transaction costs, and discounts or premiums relate is adjusted to market rates prior to the expected maturity of the financial instrument. In this case, the appropriate amortization period is the period until the next adjustment date'.
In this case, the applicable interest rate of -1% from June 2020 to June 2021 and from June 2021 to June 2022 corresponds to a specific period after which the funding is adjusted to market rates (specifically, the average rate applied in the Eurosystem's main refinancing operations) and must therefore be accrued until the next adjustment date. The early repayment windows of this funding program are substantive terms, given that at that time of adjustment of the funding cost to market, the entity may opt for renewal or cancellation and obtain new funding at more favorable terms.
Grupo Santander has opted to accrue interest in accordance with the specific periods of adjustment to market rates, so that the interest corresponding to that period (-1%) will be recorded in the income statement from June 2020 to June 2022, assuming compliance with the threshold of eligible loans that gives rise to the extra rate.
Compliance with the qualifying loan thresholds is assessed at each reporting date and is based on the financial budgets approved by the Group's directors, as well as on the evolution of macroeconomic variables (GDP, unemployment rate, inflation, etc.). If, subsequent to the initial recording of the financial liability, there is a change in the expectations of meeting this threshold of eligible loans, the Group would adjust the carrying amount of the financial liability to the amount resulting from discounting the new estimated flows at the original Effective Interest Rate (EIR), recognizing this difference in profit or loss, without modifying the original EIR.
At the end of both periods, the Group has met the financing objective established in the program, although the data relating to the second reference period (October 2020 to December 2021), will not be sent until next May, after validation by the external auditor, as established in the program conditions.
▪ Marketable debt securities: includes the amount of bonds and other debt represented by marketable securities, other than those having the substance of subordinated liabilities (amount of the loans received, which for credit priority purposes are after common creditors, and includes the amount of the financial instruments issued by the Group which, having the legal nature of capital, do not meet the requirements to qualify as equity, such as certain preferred shares issued). This item includes the component that has the consideration of financial liability of the securities issued that are compound financial instruments.
▪ Derivatives: includes the fair value, with a negative balance for the Group, of derivatives, including embedded derivatives separated from the host contract, which do not form part of hedge accounting.
• Short positions: includes the amount of financial liabilities arising from the outright sale of financial assets acquired under reverse repurchase agreements or borrowed.
▪ Other financial liabilities: includes the amount of payment obligations having the nature of financial liabilities not included in other items (includes, among others, the balance of lease liabilities that started to be recorded in 2019 as a result of the application of IFRS 16), and liabilities under financial guarantee contracts, unless they have been classified as non-performing.
▪ Changes in the fair value of hedged items in portfolio hedges of interest rate risk: this item is the balancing entry for the amounts charged to the consolidated income statement in respect of the measurement of the portfolios of financial instruments which are effectively hedged against interest rate risk through fair value hedging derivatives.
▪ Hedging derivatives: includes the fair value of the Group’s liability in respect of derivatives, including embedded derivatives separated from hybrid financial instruments, designated as hedging instruments in hedge accounting.

Auditor's Consolidated Notes to the consolidated Contents report financial statements financial statements Appendix d) Measurement of financial assets and liabilities and recognition of fair value changes In general, financial assets and liabilities are initially recognised at fair value which, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, is deemed to be the transaction price.
In this regard, IFRS 9 states that regular way purchases or sales of financial assets shall be recognised and derecognised on the trade date or on the settlement date. Grupo Santander has opted to make such recognition on the trading date or settlement date, depending on the convention of each of the markets in which the transactions are carried out. For example, in relation to the purchase or sale of debt securities or equity instruments traded in the Spanish market, securities market regulations stipulate their effective transfer at the time of settlement and, therefore, the same time has been established for the accounting record to be made.
The fair value of instruments not measured at fair value through profit and loss is adjusted by transaction costs. Subsequently, and on the occasion of each accounting close, they are valued in accordance with the following criteria: i. Measurement of financial assets Financial assets are measured at fair value are valued mainly at their fair value without deducting any transaction cost for their sale.
The fair value of a financial instrument on a given date is taken to be the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. The most objective and common reference for the fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be paid for it on an active, transparent and deep market (quoted price or market price). At 31 December 2021, there were no significant investments in quoted financial instruments that had ceased to be recognised at their quoted price because their market could not be deemed to be active.
If there is no market price for a given financial instrument, its fair value is estimated on the basis of the price established in recent transactions involving similar instruments and, in the absence thereof, of valuation techniques commonly used by the international financial community, taking into account the specific features of the instrument to be measured and, particularly, the various types of risk associated with it.
All derivatives are recognised in the balance sheet at fair value from the trade date. If the fair value is positive, they are recognised as an asset and if the fair value is negative, they are recognised as a liability. The fair value on the trade date is deemed, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, to be the transaction price. The changes in the fair value of derivatives from the trade date are recognised in 'Gains/losses on financial assets and liabilities held for trading (net)' in the consolidated income statement. Specifically, the fair value of financial derivatives traded in organised markets included in the portfolios of financial assets or liabilities held for trading is deemed to be their daily quoted price and if, for exceptional reasons, the quoted price cannot be determined on a given date, these financial derivatives are measured using methods similar to those used to measure derivatives.
The fair value of derivatives is taken to be the sum of the future cash flows arising from the instrument, discounted to present value at the date of measurement (present value or theoretical close) using valuation techniques commonly used by the financial markets: net present value, option pricing models and other methods.
The amount of debt securities and loans and advances under a business model whose objective is to collect the principal and interest flows are valued at their amortised cost, as long as they comply with the 'SPPI' (Solely Payments of Principal and Interest) test, using the effective interest rate method in their determination. Amortised cost refers to the acquisition cost of a corrected financial asset or liability (more or less, as the case may be) for repayments of principal and the part systematically charged to the consolidated income statement of the difference between the initial cost and the corresponding reimbursement value at expiration. In the case of financial assets, the amortised cost includes, in addition, the corrections to their value due to the impairment. In the loans and advances covered in fair value hedging transactions, the changes that occur in their fair value related to the risk or the risks covered in these hedging transactions are recorded.
The effective interest rate is the discount rate that exactly matches the carrying amount of a financial instrument to all its estimated cash flows of all kinds over its remaining life. For fixed rate financial instruments, the effective interest rate coincides with the contractual interest rate established on the acquisition date plus, where applicable, the fees and transaction costs that, because of their nature, form part of their financial return. In the case of floating rate financial instruments, the effective interest rate coincides with the rate of return prevailing in all connections until the next benchmark interest reset date.
Equity instruments and contracts related with these instruments are measured at fair value. However, in certain circumstances the Group estimates cost value as a suitable estimate of the fair value. This can happen if the recent event available information is not enough to measure the fair value or if there is a broad range of possible measures and the cost value represents the best estimates of fair value within this range.
The amounts at which the financial assets are recognised represent, in all material respects, the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk at each reporting date. Also, Grupo Santander has received collateral and other credit enhancements to mitigate its exposure to credit risk, which consist mainly of mortgage guarantees, cash collateral, equity instruments and personal security, assets leased out under finance lease and full-service lease agreements, assets acquired under repurchase agreements, securities loans and credit derivatives.
ii. Measurement of financial liabilities In general, financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost, as defined above, except for those included under 'Financial liabilities held for trading' and 'Financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss' and financial liabilities designated as hedged items (or hedging instruments) in fair value hedges, which are measured at fair value. The changes in credit risk arising from financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss are recognised in accumulated other comprehensive income, unless they generate or increase an accounting mismatch, in which case changes in the fair value of the financial liability in all respects are recognised in the income statement.

Valuation techniques The following table summarises the fair values, at the end of each of the years indicated, of the financial assets and liabilities listed below, classified according to the different valuation methodologies used by the Group to determine their fair value:
EUR million 2021 2020 2019. 
Published Published Published price quotations in active Internal Models price quotations in active Internal Models price quotations in active Internal Models markets (level 1) (level 2 and 3) Total markets (level 1) (level 2 and 3) Total markets (level 1) (level 2 and 3) Total.

Liabilities under insurance or reinsurance contracts — 770 770 — 910 910 — 739 739. 
The financial instruments at fair value determined on the basis of published price quotations in active markets (level 1) include government debt securities, private-sector debt securities, derivatives traded in organised markets, securitised assets, shares, short positions and fixed-income securities issued.
In cases where price quotations cannot be observed, management makes its best estimate of the price that the market would set, using its own internal models. In most cases, these internal models use data based on observable market parameters as significant inputs (level 2) and, in cases, they use significant inputs not observable in market data (level 3). In order to make these estimates, various techniques are employed, including the extrapolation of observable market data. The best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument on initial recognition is the transaction price, unless the fair value of the instrument can be obtained from other market transactions performed with the same or similar instruments or can be measured by using a valuation technique in which the variables used include only observable market data, mainly interest rates.
Grupo Santander has developed a formal process for the systematic valuation and management of financial instruments, which has been implemented worldwide across all the Group’s units. The governance scheme for this process distributes responsibilities between two independent divisions: Treasury (development, marketing and daily management of financial products and market data) and Risk (on a periodic basis, validation of pricing models and market data, computation of risk metrics, new transaction approval policies, management of market risk and implementation of fair value adjustment policies).
The approval of new products follows a sequence of steps (request, development, validation, integration in corporate systems and quality assurance) before the product is brought into production. This process ensures that pricing systems have been properly reviewed and are stable before they are used.
The following subsections set forth the most important products and families of derivatives, and the related valuation techniques and inputs, by asset class:
Fixed income and inflation The fixed income asset class includes basic instruments such as interest rate forwards, interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps, which are valued using the net present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted taking into account basis swap and cross currency spreads determined on the basis of the payment frequency and currency of each leg of the derivative. Vanilla options, including caps, floors and swaptions, are priced using the Black-Scholes model, which is one of the benchmark industry models. More exotic derivatives are priced using more complex models which are generally accepted as standard across institutions.
These pricing models are fed with observable market data such as deposit interest rates, futures rates, cross currency swap and constant maturity swap rates, and basis spreads, on the basis of which different yield curves, depending on the payment frequency, and discounting curves are calculated for each currency. In the case of options, implied volatilities are also used as model inputs. These volatilities are observable in the market for cap and floor options and swaptions, and interpolation and extrapolation of volatilities from the quoted ranges are carried out using generally accepted industry models. The pricing of more exotic derivatives may require the use of non-observable data or parameters, such as correlation (among interest rates and cross-asset), mean reversion rates and prepayment rates, which are usually defined from historical data or through calibration.

Auditor's Consolidated Notes to the consolidated Contents report financial statements financial statements Appendix. 
Inflation-related assets include zero-coupon or year-on-year inflation-linked bonds and swaps, valued with the present value method using forward estimation and discounting. Derivatives on inflation indices are priced using standard or more complex bespoke models, as appropriate. Valuation inputs of these models consider inflation-linked swap spreads observable in the market and estimations of inflation seasonality, on the basis of which a forward inflation curve is calculated. Also, implied volatilities taken from zero-coupon and year-on-year inflation options are also inputs for the pricing of more complex derivatives.
Equity and foreign exchange The most important products in these asset classes are forward and futures contracts; they also include vanilla, listed and OTC (Over-TheCounter) derivatives on single underlying assets and baskets of assets. Vanilla options are priced using the standard Black-Scholes model and more exotic derivatives involving forward returns, average performance, or digital, barrier or callable features are priced using generally accepted industry models or bespoke models, as appropriate. For derivatives on illiquid stocks, hedging takes into account the liquidity constraints in models.
The inputs of equity models consider yield curves, spot prices, dividends, asset funding costs (repo margin spreads), implied volatilities, correlation among equity stocks and indices, and crossasset correlation. Implied volatilities are obtained from market quotes of European and American-style vanilla call and put options. Various interpolation and extrapolation techniques are used to obtain continuous volatility for illiquid stocks. Dividends are usually estimated for the mid and long term. Correlations are implied, when possible, from market quotes of correlation-dependent products. In all other cases, proxies are used for correlations between benchmark underlyings or correlations are obtained from historical data.
The inputs of foreign exchange models include the yield curve for each currency, the spot foreign exchange rate, the implied volatilities and the correlation among assets of this class. Volatilities are obtained from European call and put options which are quoted in markets as of-the-money, risk reversal or butterfly options. Illiquid currency pairs are usually handled by using the data of the liquid pairs from which the illiquid currency can be derived. For more exotic products, unobservable model parameters may be estimated by fitting to reference prices provided by other non-quoted market sources.
Credit The most common instrument in this asset class is the credit default swap (CDS), which is used to hedge credit exposure to third parties. In addition, models for first-to-default (FTD), n-to-default (NTD) and single-tranche collateralised debt obligation (CDO) products are also available. These products are valued with standard industry models, which estimate the probability of default of a single issuer (for CDS) or the joint probability of default of more than one issuer for FTD, NTD and CDO.
Valuation inputs are the yield curve, the CDS spread curve and the recovery rate. For indices and important individual issuers, the CDS spread curve is obtained in the market. For less liquid issuers, this spread curve is estimated using proxies or other credit-dependent instruments. Recovery rates are usually set to standard values. For listed single-tranche CDO, the correlation of joint default of several issuers is implied from the market. For FTD, NTD and bespoke CDO, the correlation is estimated from proxies or historical data when no other option is available.
Valuation adjustment for counterparty risk or default risk The Credit valuation adjustment (CVA) is a valuation adjustment to over the counter (OTC) derivatives as a result of the risk associated with the credit exposure assumed to each counterparty.
The CVA is calculated taking into account potential exposure to each counterparty in each future period. The CVA for a specific counterparty is equal to the sum of the CVA for all the periods. The following inputs are used to calculate the CVA: • Expected exposure: including for each transaction the mark-tomarket (MtM) value plus an add-on for the potential future exposure for each period. Mitigating factors such as collateral and netting agreements are taken into account, as well as a temporary impairment factor for derivatives with interim payments.
• Severity: percentage of final loss assumed in a counterparty credit event/default.
• Probability of default: for cases where there is no market information (the CDS quoted spread curve, etc.), proxies based on companies holding exchange-listed CDS, in the same industry and with the same external rating as the counterparty, are used.
• Discount factor curve.
The Debit Valuation Adjustment (DVA) is a valuation adjustment similar to the CVA but, in this case, it arises as a result of the Group’s own risk assumed by its counterparties in OTC derivatives.
The CVA at 31 December 2021 amounted to EUR 237 million (resulting in a decrease of 41.9% compared to 31 December 2020) and DVA amounted to EUR 162 million (resulting in a decrease of 30.4% compared to 31 December 2020). These impacts are mainly due to the continuous improvement in credit markets, the creation of particular credit curves for certain counterparties and the introduction of methodological improvements in the calculation of exposures.
The CVA at 31 December 2020 amounted to EUR 408 million (resulting in an increase of 49.8% compared to 31 December 2019) and DVA amounted to EUR 233 million (resulting in an increase of 36.0% compared to 31 December 2019). These impacts were due to the fact that credit spread levels were at levels above 25% compared to 2019 due to the covid-19 pandemic.
The CVA at 31 December 2019 amounted to EUR 272 million (decrease of 22.5% compared to 31 December 2018) and DVA amounted EUR 171 million (decrease of 34.6% compared to 31 December 2018). The decrease was mainly due to improvements in the credit quality of counterparties, which led to reductions in credit spreads in percentages of around 40% in the most liquid maturities.
In addition, the Group amounts the funding fair value adjustment (FFVA) is calculated by applying future market funding spreads to the expected future funding exposure of any uncollateralised component of the OTC derivative portfolio. This includes the uncollateralised component of collateralised derivatives in addition to derivatives that are fully uncollateralised. The expected future funding exposure is calculated by a simulation methodology, where available. The FFVA impact is not material for the consolidated financial statements as of 31 December 2021, 2020 and 2019.

Auditor's Consolidated Notes to the consolidated Contents report financial statements financial statements Appendix. 
Grupo Santander has not carried out significant reclassifications of financial instruments between levels other than those disclosed in level 3 movement table during 2021 continuing the trend observed in 2020. The main variations over the last few years in the Level 3 volume have been due to purchases/sales of these instruments. There have been no significant variations in the market observability conditions, nor relevant changes in the criteria used for the classification of instruments within the fair value hierarchy.
In 2019, the Group reclassified between levels 2 and 3 financial instruments for a net amount of EUR 708 million (mainly due to reclassifications to level 2 of positions, both derivatives as debt instruments, with maturities for that there were already observable assessment inputs or on which new sources of information have been recurring prices, and at level 3 certain bonds in Brazil that, based on the criteria of observability of the Group, did not meet the requirements to be considered as observable inputs).
Valuation adjustments due to model risk The valuation models described above do not involve a significant level of subjectivity, since they can be adjusted and recalibrated, where appropriate, through internal calculation of the fair value and subsequent comparison with the related actively traded price. However, valuation adjustments may be necessary when market quoted prices are not available for comparison purposes.
The sources of risk are associated with uncertain model parameters, illiquid underlying issuers, and poor quality market data or missing risk factors (sometimes the best available option is to use limited models with controllable risk). In these situations, the Group calculates and applies valuation adjustments in accordance with common industry practice. The main sources of model risk are described below: • In the fixed income markets, the sources of model risk include bond index correlations, basis spread modelling, the risk of calibrating model parameters and the treatment of near-zero or negative interest rates. Other sources of risk arise from the estimation of market data, such as volatilities or yield curves, whether used for estimation or cash flow discounting purposes.
• In the stock markets, the sources of model risk include forward skew modelling, the impact of stochastic interest rates, correlation and multi-curve modelling. Other sources of risk arise from managing hedges of digital callable and barrier option payments. Also worthy of consideration as sources of risk are the estimation of market data such as dividends and correlation for quanto and composite basket options.
• For specific financial instruments relating to home mortgage loans secured by financial institutions in the UK (which are regulated and partially financed by the Government) and property asset derivatives, the main input is the Halifax House Price Index (HPI). In these cases, risk assumptions include estimations of the future growth and the volatility of the HPI, the mortality rate and the implied credit spreads.
• Inflation markets are exposed to model risk resulting from uncertainty around modelling the correlation structure among various Consumer Price Index (CPI) rates. Another source of risk may arise from the bid-offer spread of inflation-linked swaps.
• The currency markets are exposed to model risk resulting from forward skew modelling and the impact of stochastic interest rate and correlation modelling for multi-asset instruments. Risk may also arise from market data, due to the existence of specific illiquid foreign exchange pairs.
• The most important source of model risk for credit derivatives relates to the estimation of the correlation between the probabilities of default of different underlying issuers. For illiquid underlying issuers, the CDS spread may not be well defined.

Auditor's Consolidated Notes to the consolidated Contents report financial statements financial statements Appendix. 
Financial Instruments (level 3) Set forth below are the Group’s main financial instruments measured using unobservable market data as significant inputs of the internal models (level 3): • HTC&S (Hold to collect and sale) syndicated loans classified in the fair value category with changes in other comprehensive income, where the cost of liquidity is not directly observable in the market, as well as the prepayment option in favour of the borrower.
• Illiquid equity in non-trading portfolios, classified at fair value through profit or loss and at fair value through equity.
• Instruments in Santander UK’s portfolio (loans, debt instruments and derivatives) linked to the House Price Index (HPI). Even if the valuation techniques used for these instruments may be the same as those used to value similar products (present value in the case of loans and debt instruments, and the Black-Scholes model for derivatives), the main factors used in the valuation of these instruments are the HPI spot rate, the growth and volatility thereof, and the mortality rates, which are not always observable in the market and, accordingly, these instruments are considered illiquid.
• Callable interest rate derivatives (Bermudan-style options) where the main unobservable input is mean reversion of interest rates.
• Trading derivatives on interest rates, taking as an underlying asset titling and with the amortization rate (CPR, Conditional prepayment rate) as unobservable main entry.
• Derivatives from trading on inflation in Spain, where volatility is not observable in the market.
• Equity volatility derivatives, specifically indices and equities, where volatility is not observable in the long term.
• Derivatives on long-term interest rate and FX in some units (mainly South America)where for certain underlyings it is not possible to demonstrate observability to these terms.
• Debt instruments referenced to certain illiquid interest rates, for which there is no reasonable market observability.
The measurements obtained using the internal models might have been different if other methods or assumptions had been used with respect to interest rate risk, to credit risk, market risk and foreign currency risk spreads, or to their related correlations and volatilities. Nevertheless, the Bank’s directors consider that the fair value of the financial assets and liabilities recognised in the consolidated balance sheet and the gains and losses arising from these financial instruments are reasonable.
The net amount recognised in profit and loss in 2021 arising from models whose significant inputs are unobservable market data (level 3) amounted to EUR 73 million profit (EUR 193 million profit in 2020 and EUR 85 million profit in 2019).
The table below shows the effect, at 31 December 2021 and 2020 on the fair value of the main financial instruments classified as level 3 of a reasonable change in the assumptions used in the valuation. This effect was determined by applying the probable valuation ranges of the main unobservable inputs detailed in the following table:

Auditor's Consolidated Notes to the consolidated Contents report financial statements financial statements Appendix iv. Recognition of fair value changes As a general rule, changes in the carrying amount of financial assets and liabilities are recognised in the consolidated income statement. A distinction is made between the changes resulting from the accrual of interest and similar items, (which are recognised under Interest income or Interest expense, as appropriate), and those arising for other reasons, which are recognised at their net amount under 'Gains/losses on financial assets and liabilities'.
Adjustments due to changes in fair value arising from: • 'Financial assets at fair value with changes in other comprehensive income' are recorded temporarily, in the case of debt instruments in 'Other comprehensive income - Elements that can be reclassified to profit or loss - Financial assets at fair value with changes in other comprehensive income', while in the case of equity instruments are recorded in 'other comprehensive income Elements that will not be reclassified to line item - Changes in the fair value of equity instruments valued at fair value with changes in other comprehensive income'.
Exchange differences on debt instruments measured at fair value with changes in other comprehensive income are recognised under 'Exchange Differences, net' of the consolidated income statement. Exchange differences on equity instruments, in which the irrevocable option of being measured at fair value with changes in other comprehensive income has been chosen, are recognised in 'Other comprehensive income - Items that will not be reclassified to profit or loss - Changes in the fair value of equity instruments measured at fair value with changes in other comprehensive income'.
• Items charged or credited to 'Items that may be reclassified to profit or loss – Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income' and 'Other comprehensive income – Items that may be reclassified to profit or loss – Exchange differences in equity' remain in the Group's consolidated equity until the asset giving rise to them is impaired or derecognised, at which time they are recognised in the consolidated income statement.
• Unrealised gains on Financial assets classified as Non-current assets held for sale because they form part of a disposal group or a discontinued operation are recognised in 'Other comprehensive income under Items that may be reclassified to profit or loss – Non-current assets held for sale'.
v. Hedging transactions The consolidated entities use financial derivatives for the following purposes: i) to facilitate these instruments to customers who request them in the management of their market and credit risks; ii) to use these derivatives in the management of the risks of the Group entities’ own positions and assets and liabilities (hedging derivatives); and iii) to obtain gains from changes in the prices of these derivatives (derivatives).
Financial derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are treated for accounting purposes as trading derivatives.
A derivative qualifies for hedge accounting if all the following conditions are met: 1. The derivative hedges one of the following three types of exposure: a. Changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities due to fluctuations, among others, in the interest rate and/or exchange rate to which the position or balance to be hedged is subject (fair value hedge).
b. Changes in the estimated cash flows arising from financial assets and liabilities, commitments and highly probable forecast transactions (cash flow hedge).
c. The net investment in a foreign operation (hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation).
2. It is effective in offsetting exposure inherent in the hedged item or position throughout the expected term of the hedge, which means that: a. At the date of arrangement the hedge is expected, under normal conditions, to be highly effective (prospective effectiveness).
b. There is sufficient evidence that the hedge was actually effective during the whole life of the hedged item or position (retrospective effectiveness). To this end, the Group checks that the results of the hedge were within a range of 80% to 125% of the results of the hedged item.
3. There must be adequate documentation evidencing the specific designation of the financial derivative to hedge certain balances or transactions and how this hedge was expected to be achieved and measured, provided that this is consistent with the Group’s management of own risks.

Auditor's Consolidated Notes to the consolidated Contents report financial statements financial statements Appendix. 
The changes in value of financial instruments qualifying for hedge accounting are recognised as follows: a. In fair value hedges, the gains or losses arising on both the hedging instruments and the hedged items attributable to the type of risk being hedged are recognised directly in the consolidated income statement.
In fair value hedges of interest rate risk on a portfolio of financial instruments, the gains or losses that arise on measuring the hedging instruments are recognised directly in the consolidated income statement, whereas the gains or losses due to changes in the fair value of the hedged amount (attributable to the hedged risk) are recognised in the consolidated income statement with a balancing entry under Changes in the fair value of hedged items in portfolio hedges of interest rate risk on the asset or liability side of the balance sheet, as appropriate.
b. In cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the change in value of the hedging instrument is recognised temporarily in Other comprehensive income – under Items that may be reclassified to profit or loss – Hedging derivatives – Cash flow hedges (effective portion) until the forecast transactions occur, when it is recognised in the consolidated income statement, unless, if the forecast transactions result in the recognition of nonfinancial assets or liabilities, it is included in the cost of the nonfinancial asset or liability.
c. In hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation, the gains or losses attributable to the portion of the hedging instruments qualifying as an effective hedge are recognised temporarily in Other comprehensive income under Items that may be reclassified to profit or loss – Hedges of net investments in foreign operations until the gains or losses – on the hedged item are recognised in profit or loss.
d. The ineffective portion of the gains or losses on the hedging instruments of cash flow hedges and hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation is recognised directly under 'Gains/losses on financial assets and liabilities (net)' in the consolidated income statement, in Gains or losses from hedge accounting, net.
If a derivative designated as a hedge no longer meets the requirements described above due to expiration, ineffectiveness or for any other reason, the derivative is classified for accounting purposes as a trading derivative.
When fair value hedge accounting is discontinued, the adjustments previously recognised on the hedged item are amortised to profit or loss at the effective interest rate recalculated at the date of hedge discontinuation. The adjustments must be fully amortised at maturity.
When cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity under other comprehensive income 'Items that may be reclassified to profit or loss' (from the period when the hedge was effective) remains in this equity item until the forecast transaction occurs, at which time it is recognised in profit or loss, unless the transaction is no longer expected to occur, in which case the cumulative gain or loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
vi. Derivatives embedded in hybrid financial instruments Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or in other host contracts are accounted for separately as derivatives if their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts, provided that the host contracts are not classified as financial assets/ liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss or as 'Financial assets/liabilities held for trading'.
e) Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities The accounting treatment of transfers of financial assets depends on the extent to which the risks and rewards associated with the transferred assets are transferred to third parties: 1. If the Group transfers substantially all the risks and rewards to third parties unconditional -sale of financial assets, sale of financial assets under an agreement to repurchase them at their fair value at the date of repurchase, sale of financial assets with a purchased call option or written put option that is deeply out of the money, securitisation of assets in which the transferor does not retain a subordinated debt or grant any credit enhancement to the new holders, and other similar cases-, the transferred financial asset is derecognised and any rights or obligations retained or created in the transfer are recognised simultaneously.
2. If the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards associated with the transferred financial asset -sale of financial assets under an agreement to repurchase them at a fixed price or at the sale price plus interest, a securities lending agreement in which the borrower undertakes to return the same or similar assets, and other similar cases-, the transferred financial asset is not derecognised and continues to be measured by the same criteria as those used before the transfer. However, the following items are recognised: a. An associated financial liability, which is recognised for an amount equal to the consideration received and is subsequently measured at amortised cost, unless it meets the requirements for classification under 'Financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss'.
b. The income from the transferred financial asset not derecognised and any expense incurred on the new financial liability, without offsetting.
Annual report 2021 570


 

 

 

 


Auditor's Consolidated Notes to the consolidated Contents report financial statements financial statements Appendix 3. If the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards associated with the transferred financial asset -sale of financial assets with a purchased call option or written put option that is not deeply in or out of the money, securitisation of assets in which the transferor retains a subordinated debt or other type of credit enhancement for a portion of the transferred asset, and other similar cases- the following distinction is made: a. If the transferor does not retain control of the transferred financial asset, the asset is derecognised and any rights or obligations retained or created in the transfer are recognised.
b. If the transferor retains control of the transferred financial asset, it continues to recognise it for an amount equal to its exposure to changes in value and recognises a financial liability associated with the transferred financial asset. The net carrying amount of the transferred asset and the associated liability is the amortised cost of the rights and obligations retained, if the transferred asset is measured at amortised cost, or the fair value of the rights and obligations retained, if the transferred asset is measured at fair value.
Accordingly, financial assets are only derecognised when the rights to the cash flows they generate have expired or when substantially all the inherent risks and rewards have been transferred to third parties. Similarly, financial liabilities are only derecognised when the obligations they generate have been extinguished or when they are acquired with the intention either to cancel them or to resell them.
Regarding contractual modifications of financial assets, Grupo Santander has differentiated them into two main categories in relation to the conditions under which a modification leads to a derecognition or disposal of the financial asset (and the recognition of a new financial asset) and those under which the accounting of the original financial instrument with the modified terms is maintained: • Contractual modifications for commercial or market reasons, which are generally carried out at the request of the debtor to apply current market conditions to the debt. The new contract is considered a new transaction and, consequently, it is necessary to derecognize the original financial asset and recognize a new financial asset subject to the classification and measurement requirements established by IFRS 9. Also, the new financial asset will be recorded at fair value and, if applicable, the difference between the carrying amount of the asset derecognized and the fair value of the new asset will be recognized in profit or loss.
• Modifications due to refinancing or restructuring, in which the payment conditions are modified to allow a customer that is experiencing financial difficulties (current or foreseeable) to meet its payment obligations and that, if such modification had not been made, it would be reasonably certain that it would not be able to meet such payment obligations. In this case, the modification does not result in the derecognition of the financial asset, but rather the original financial asset is maintained and does not require a new assessment of its classification and measurement. When assessing credit impairment, the current credit risk (considering the modified cash flows) should be compared with the credit risk at initial recognition. Finally, the gross carrying amount of the financial asset (the present value of the renegotiated or modified contractual cash flows that are discounted at the original effective interest rate of the financial asset) should be recalculated, with a gain or loss recognized in profit or loss for the difference.

At 31 December 2021, Grupo Santander has offset other items amounting to EUR 1,188 million (EUR 1,194 million and EUR 1,366 million at 31 December 2020 and 2019, respectively).
At 31 December 2021 the balance sheet shows the amounts EUR 106,430 million (EUR 130,653 million and EUR 141,201 million at 31 December 2020 and 2019) on derivatives and repos as assets and EUR 104,130 million (EUR 122,416 million and EUR 134,694 million at 31 December 2020 and 2019) on derivatives and repos as liabilities that are subject to netting and collateral arrangements.
g) Impairment of financial assets i. Definition Grupo Santander associates an impairment in the value to financial assets measured at amortised cost, debt instruments measured at fair value with changes in other comprehensive income, lease receivables and commitments and guarantees granted that are not measured at fair value.
The impairment for expected credit losses is recorded with a charge to the consolidated income statement for the period in which the impairment arises. In the event of occurrence, the recoveries of previously recognised impairment losses are recorded in the consolidated income statement for the period in which the impairment no longer exists or is reduced.
In the case of purchased or originated credit-impaired assets, the Group only recognizes at the reporting date the changes in the expected credit losses during the life of the asset since the initial recognition as a credit loss. In the case of assets measured at fair value with changes in other comprehensive income, the changes in the fair value due to expected credit losses are charged in the consolidated income statement of the year where the change happened, reflecting the rest of the valuation in other comprehensive income.
As a rule, the expected credit loss is estimated as the difference between the contractual cash flows to be recovered and the expected cash flows discounted using the original effective interest rate. In the case of purchased or originated credit-impaired assets, this difference is discounted using the effective interest rate adjusted by credit rating.
Depending on the classification of financial instruments, which is mentioned in the following sections, the expected credit losses may be along 12 months or during the life of the financial instrument: • 12-month expected credit losses: arising from the potential default events, as defined in the following sections that are estimated to be likely to occur within the 12 months following the reporting date. These losses will be associated with financial assets classified as 'normal risk' as defined in the following sections.
• Expected credit losses over the life of the financial instrument: arising from the potential default events that are estimated to be likely to occur throughout the life of the financial instruments. These losses are associated with financial assets classified as 'normal risk under watchlist' or 'doubtful risk'.
With the purpose of estimating the expected life of the financial instrument all the contractual terms have been taken into account (e.g. prepayments, duration, purchase options, etc.), being the contractual period (including extension options) the maximum period considered to measure the expected credit losses. In the case of financial instruments with an uncertain maturity period and a component of undrawn commitment (e.g.: credit cards), the expected life is estimated through quantitative analyses to determine the period during which the entity is exposed to credit risk, also considering the effectiveness of management procedures that mitigate such exposure (e.g. the ability to unilaterally cancel such financial instruments, etc.).
The following constitute effective guarantees: a) Mortgage guarantees on housing as long as they are first duly constituted and registered in favour of the entity. The properties include: i. Buildings and building elements, distinguishing among: • Houses.
• Offices, stores and multi-purpose premises.
• Rest of buildings such as non-multi-purpose premises and hotels.
ii. Urban and developable ordered land.
iii. Rest of properties that classify as: buildings and building elements under construction, such as property development in progress and halted development, and the rest of land types, such as rustic lands.
b) Collateral guarantees on financial instruments in the form of cash deposits and debt securities issued by creditworthy issuers.
c) Other types of real guarantees, including properties received in guarantee and second and subsequent mortgages on properties, as long as the entity demonstrates its effectiveness. When assessing the effectiveness of the second and subsequent mortgages on properties the entity will implement particularly restrictive criteria. It will take into account, among others, whether the previous charges are in favour of the entity itself or not and the relationship between the risk guaranteed by them and the property value.
d) Personal guarantees, as well as the incorporation of new owners, covering the entire amount of the financial instruments and implying direct and joint liability to the entity of persons or other entities whose solvency is sufficiently proven to ensure the repayment of the loan on the agreed terms.
The different aspects that the Group considers for the evaluation of effective guarantees are set out below in relation to the individual analysis.

Auditor's Consolidated Notes to the consolidated Contents report financial statements financial statements Appendix ii. Financial instruments presentation For the purposes of estimating the impairment amount, and in accordance with its internal policies, the Group classifies its financial instruments (financial assets, commitments and guarantees) measured at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income in one of the following categories: • Normal Risk ('stage 1'): includes all instruments that do not meet the requirements to be classified in the rest of the categories.
• Normal risk under watchlist ('stage 2'): includes all instruments that, without meeting the criteria for classification as doubtful or default risk, have experienced significant increases in credit risk since initial recognition.
In order to determine whether a financial instrument has increased its credit risk since initial recognition and is to be classified in stage 2, the Group considers the following criteria:
Changes in the risk of a default occurring through the expected life of the financial instrument are analysed and quantified with respect to its credit level in its initial recognition.
With the purpose of determining if such changes are considered as significant, with the consequent classification into stage 2, each Group unit has defined the quantitative thresholds to consider in each of its portfolios taking into account corporate guidelines ensuring a consistent interpretation in all units.
Quantitative Within the quantitative thresholds, two types are criteria considered: A relative threshold is those that compare current credit quality with credit quality at the time of origination in percentage terms of change. In addition, an absolute threshold compares both references in total terms, calculating the difference between the two. These absolute/relative concepts are used homogeneously (with different values) in all geographies. The use of one type of threshold or another (or both) is determined in accordance with the process described in note 53, below, and is marked by the type of portfolio and characteristics such as the starting point of the average credit quality of the portfolio.
In addition to the quantitative criteria indicated, various indicators are used that are aligned with those used by the Group in the normal management of credit risk. Irregular positions of more than 30 days and renewals are common criteria in all Group units. In addition, each Qualitative unit can define other qualitative indicators, for each of its criteria portfolios, according to the particularities and normal management practices in line with the policies currently in force (i.e. use of management alerts, etc.). The use of these qualitative criteria is complemented with the use of an expert judgement, under the corresponding governance.
In the case of forbearances, instruments classified as 'normal risk under watchlist' may be generally reclassified to 'normal risk' in the following circumstances: at least two years have elapsed from the date of reclassification to that category or from its forbearance date, the client has paid the accrued principal and interest balance, and the client has no other instruments with more than 30 days past due balances.
• Doubtful Risk ('stage 3'): includes financial instruments, overdue or not, in which, without meeting the circumstances to classify them in the category of default risk, there are reasonable doubts about their total repayment (principal and interests) by the client in the terms contractually agreed. Likewise, off-balance-sheet exposures whose payment is probable and their recovery doubtful are considered in stage 3. Within this category, two situations are differentiated: – Doubtful risk for non-performing loans: financial instruments, irrespective of the client and guarantee, with balances more than 90 days past due for principal, interest or expenses contractually agreed.
This category also includes all loan balances for a client which overdue amount more than 90 days past due is greater than 20% of the loan receivable balance.
These instruments may be reclassified to other categories if, as a result of the collection of part of the past due balances, the reasons for their classification in this category do not remain and the client does not have balances more than 90 days past due in other loans.
– Doubtful risk for reasons other than non-performing loans: this category includes doubtful recovery financial instruments that are not more than 90 days past due.
Grupo Santander considers that a financial instrument to be doubtful for reasons other than delinquency when one or more combined events have occurred with a negative impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial instrument. To this end, the following indicators, among others, are considered: a) Negative net equity or decrease because of losses of the client's net equity by at least 50% during the last financial year.
b) Continued losses or significant decrease in revenue or, in general, in the client's recurring cash flows.
c) Generalised delay in payments or insufficient cash flows to service debts.
d) Significantly inadequate economic or financial structure or inability to obtain additional financing by the client.
e) Existence of an internal or external credit rating showing that the client is in default.
f) Existence of overdue customer commitments with a significant amount to public institutions or employees.
These financial instruments may be reclassified to other categories if, as a result of an individualised study, reasonable doubts do not remain about the total repayment under the contractually agreed terms and the client does not have balances with more than 90 days past due.
In the case of forbearances, instruments classified as doubtful risk may be reclassified to the category of 'normal risk under watchlist' when the following circumstances are present: a minimum period of one year has elapsed from the forbearance date, the client has paid the accrued principal and interest amounts, and the client has no other loan balance with more than 90 days past due.
• Default Risk: includes all financial assets, or part of them, for which, after an individualised analysis, their recovery is considered remote due to a notorious and irrecoverable deterioration of their solvency.
In any event, except in the case of financial instruments with effective collateral covering a substantial portion of the transaction amount, the Group generally consider as remote the following:
Annual report 2021 574


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 


Auditor's Consolidated Notes to the consolidated Contents report financial statements financial statements Appendix - Those operations that, after an individualized analysis, are categorized as unsustainable debt, assuming an irrecoverability of such debt.
- Transactions classified as doubtful due to non-performing loans with recovery costs that exceed the amounts receivable.
- The operations on which the award is executed. The queue of these operations shall be included under default risk, as the recovery of the flows, provided that no further guarantees associated with the operation remain after the award of the property.
- Those operations on which a deduction is made, the portion of the operation corresponding to that deduction, will be given as a balance at the time of signature.
A financial asset amount is maintained in the balance sheet until they are considered as a "default risk", either all or a part of it, and the write-off is registered against the balance sheet.
In the case of operations that have only been partially derecognised, for forgiveness reasons or because part of the total balance is considered unrecoverable, the remaining amount shall be fully classified in the category of 'doubtful risk', except where duly justified.
The classification of a financial asset, or part of it, as a 'default risk' does not involve the disruption of negotiations and legal proceedings to recover the amount.
iii. Impairment valuation assessment Grupo Santander has policies, methods and procedures in place to hedge its credit risk, both due to the insolvency attributable to counterparties and its residence in a specific country.
These policies, methods and procedures are applied in the concession, study and documentation of financial assets, commitments and guarantees, as well as in the identification of their impairment and in the calculation of the amounts needed to cover their credit risk.
The asset impairment model in IFRS 9 applies to financial assets measured at amortised cost, debt instruments at fair value with changes in other comprehensive income, lease receivables and commitments and guarantees granted that are not measured at fair value.
The impairment represents the best estimation of the financial assets expected credit losses at the balance sheet date, assessed both individually and collectively.
• Individually: for the purposes of estimating the provisions for credit risk arising from the insolvency of a financial instrument, the Group individually assesses impairment by estimating the expected credit losses on those financial instruments that are considered to be significant and with sufficient information to make such an estimate.
Therefore, this classification mostly includes wholesale banking customers —Corporations, specialised financing— as well as some of the largest companies —Chartered and real estate developers— from retail banking. The determination of the perimeter in which the individualised estimate is applied is detailed in a later section.
The individually assessed impairment estimate is equal to the difference between the gross carrying amount of the financial instrument and the estimated value of the expected cash flows receivable discounted using the original effective interest rate of the transaction. The estimate of these cash flows takes into account all available information on the financial asset and the effective guarantees associated with that asset. This estimation process is detailed below.
• Collectively: the Group also assesses impairment by estimating the expected credit losses collectively in cases where they are not assessed on an individual basis. This includes, for example, loans with individuals, sole proprietors or businesses in retail banking subject to a standardised risk management.
For the purposes of the collective assessment of expected credit losses, the Group has consistent and reliable internal models. For the development of these models, instruments with similar credit risk characteristics that are indicative of the debtors' capacity to pay are considered.
The credit risk characteristics used to group the instruments are, among others: type of instrument, debtor's sector of activity, geographical area of activity, type of guarantee, aging of past due balances and any other factor relevant to estimating the future cash flows.
Grupo Santander performs retrospective and monitoring tests to evaluate the reasonableness of the collective estimate.
On the other hand, the methodology required to estimate the expected credit loss due to credit events is based on an unbiased and weighted consideration by the probability of occurrence of a series of scenarios, considering a range of three to five possible future scenarios, depending on the characteristics of each unit, which could have an impact on the collection of contractual cash flows, always taking into account the time value of money, as well as all available and relevant information on past events, current conditions and forecasts of the evolution of macroeconomic scenarios that are shown to be relevant for the estimation of this amount (for example: GDP (Gross Domestic Product), housing price, unemployment rate, etc.).
The estimation of expected losses requires expert judgment and the support of historical, current and future information. The probability of loss is measured considering past events, the present situation and future trends of macroeconomic scenarios.
Grupo Santander uses forward-looking information in both internal risk management and prudential regulation processes, so that for the calculation of the impairment loss allowance, various scenarios are incorporated that take advantage of the experience with such information, thus ensuring consistency in obtaining the expected loss.
The challenge of the exercise has focused on the uncertainty of the economic outlook caused by the covid-19 crisis, coupled with a complex environment for value creation.

Auditor's Consolidated Notes to the consolidated Contents report financial statements financial statements Appendix. 
Grupo Santander has internally ensured the criteria to be followed for guarantees received from government bodies, both through credit lines and other public guarantees, so that when they are adequately reflected in each of the contracts, they are recognised as mitigating factors of the potential expected losses, and therefore of the provisions to be recognised, based on the provisions of the applicable standard (IFRS 9 Par. B5.5.55). Furthermore, where applicable, these guarantees are appropriately reflected in the mitigation of the significant increase in risk, considering their nature as personal guarantees.
For the estimation of the parameters used in the estimation of impairment provisions -EAD (exposure at default), PD (probability of default), LGD (loss given default)-, the Group based its experience in developing internal models for the estimation of parameters both in the regulatory area and for management purposes, adapting the development of the impairment provision models under IFRS 9.
• Exposure at default: is the amount of estimated risk incurred at the time of the counterparty's analysis.
• Probability of default: is the estimated probability that the counterparty will default on its principal and/or interest payment obligations.
• Loss given default: is the estimate of the severity of the loss incurred in the event of non-compliance. It depends mainly on the updating of the guarantees associated with the operation and the future cash flows that are expected to be recovered.
In any case, when estimating the flows expected to be recovered, portfolio sales are included. It should be noted that due to the Group's recovery policy and the experience observed in relation to the prices of past sales of assets classified as stage 3 and/or default risk, there is no substantial divergence between the flows obtained from recoveries after performing recovery management of the assets with those obtained from the sale of portfolios of assets discounting structural expenses and other costs incurred.
The definition of default implemented by the Group for the purpose of calculating the impairment provision models is based on the definition in Article 178 of Regulation 575/2013 of the European Union (CRR), which is fully aligned with the requirements of IFRS 9, which considers that a 'default' exists in relation to a specific customer/contract when at least one of the following circumstances exists: the entity considers that there are reasonable doubts about the payment of all its credit obligations or that the customer/contract is in an irregular situation for more than 90 days with respect to any significant credit obligation.
Grupo Santander will partially and voluntarily align during 2022 the accounting definition of Stage 3, as well as for the calculation of impairment provision models, to the New Definition of Default, incorporating the criteria defined by the EBA in its implementation guide of the definition of default, capturing the economic deterioration of the operations (days in default - on a daily basis - and materiality thresholds - minimum amount in arrears). The alignment of criteria will be done taking into account the criteria of IFRS 9 as well as the accounting principles of unbiased presentation of financial information. The expected increase in the default rate is estimated at around 24 basis points, with no material impact on the provision figures for credit risk.
In addition, the Group considers the risk generated in all cross-border transactions due to circumstances other than the usual commercial risk of insolvency (sovereign risk, transfer risk or risks arising from international financial activity, such as wars, natural catastrophes, balance of payments crisis, etc.).
IFRS 9 includes a series of practical solutions that can be implemented by entities, with the aim of facilitating its implementation. However, in order to achieve a complete and highlevel implementation of the standard, and following the best practices of the industry, the Group does not apply these practical solutions in a generalised manner: – Rebuttable presumption that the credit risk has increased significantly, when payments are more than 30 days past due: this threshold is used as an additional, but not primary, indicator of significant risk increase. Additionally, there may be cases in the Group where its use has been rebutted as a result of studies that show a low correlation of the significant risk increase with this past due threshold. The volume rebutted does not exceed 0.1% of the Group's total exposure.
– Assets with low credit risk at the reporting date: the Group assesses the existence of significant risk increase in all its financial instruments.
This information is provided in more detail in note 53 b.
iv. Detail of individual estimate of impairment For the individual estimate of the assessment for impairment of the financial asset, the Group has a specific methodology to estimate the value of the cash flows expected to be collected: • Recovery through the debtor's ordinary activities (going approach).
• Recovery through the execution and sale of the collateral guaranteeing the operations (gone approach).
Gone approach: a. Evaluation of the effectiveness of guarantees. 
Grupo Santander assesses the effectiveness of all the guarantees associated considering the following: • The time required to execute these guarantees.
• Grupo Santander's ability to enforce or assert these guarantees in its favour.
• The existence of limitations imposed by each local unit´s regulation on the foreclosure of collateral.
Under no circumstances the Group considers that a guarantee is effective if its effectiveness depends substantially on the solvency of the debtor, as could be the case: • Promises of shares or other securities of the debtor himself when their valuation may be significantly affected by a debtor's default.
• Personal cross-collateralisation: when the guarantor of a transaction is, at the same time, guaranteed by the holder of that transaction.
On the basis of the foregoing, the following types of guarantees are considered to be effective:
Annual report 2021 576


 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Auditor's Consolidated Notes to the consolidated Contents report financial statements financial statements Appendix • Mortgage guarantees on properties, which are first charge, duly constituted and registered. Real estate includes: – Buildings and finished building elements.
– Urban and developable land in order.
– Other real estate, including buildings under construction, developments in progress or at a standstill, and other land, such as rural properties.
• Pledges on financial instruments such as cash deposits, debt securities of reputable issuers or equity instruments.
• Other types of security interests, including movable property received as security and second and subsequent mortgages on real state , provided that they are proven to be effective under particularly restrictive criteria.
• Personal guarantees, including new holders, covering the entire amount and involving direct and joint liability to the entity, from persons or entities whose equity solvency ensures repayment of the transaction under the agreed terms.
b. Valuation of guarantees. 
Grupo Santander assesses the guarantees on the basis of their nature in accordance with the following: • Mortgage guarantees on properties associated with financial instruments, using a complete individual valuations carried out by independent valuation experts and under generally accepted valuation standards. If this is not possible, alternative valuations are used with duly documented and approved internal valuation models.
• Personal guarantees are valued individually on the basis of the guarantor´s updated information.
• The rest of the guarantees are valued based on current market values.
c. Adjustments to the value of guarantees and estimation of future cash flow inflows and outflows. 
Grupo Santander applies a series of adjustments to the value of the guarantees in order to improve the reference values: • Adjustments based on the historical sales experience of local units for certain types of assets.
• Individual expert adjustments based on additional management information.
Likewise, to adjust the value of the guarantees, the time value of money is taken into account based on the historical experience of each of the units, estimating: • Period of adjudication.
• Estimated time of sale of the asset.
In addition, the Group takes into account all those cash inflows and outflows linked to that guarantee until it is sold: • Possible future income commitments in favour of the borrower which will available after the asset is awarded.
• Estimated foreclosure costs.
• Asset maintenance costs, taxes and community costs.
• Estimated marketing or sales costs.
Finally, since it is considered that the guarantee will be sold in the future, the Group applies an additional adjustment ('index forward') in order to adjust the value of the guarantees to future valuation expectations.
v. Impairment individual assessment scope. 
Grupo Santander determines the perimeter over which it makes an estimate of the assessment for impairment on an individual basis based on a relevance threshold set by each of the geographical areas and the stage in which the operations are located. In general, the Group applies the individualised calculation of expected losses to the significant exposures classified in stage 3, although Banco Santander, S.A. has also extended its analyses to some of the exposures classified in stage 2.
It should be noted that, in any case and irrespective of the stage in which their transactions are carried out, for customers who do not receive standardised treatment, a relational risk management model is applied, with individualised treatment and monitoring by the assigned risk analyst. In addition to wholesale customers (Santander Corporate & Investment Banking or SCIB) and large companies, this relational management model also includes other segments of smaller companies for which there is information and capacity for more personalised and expert analysis and monitoring. As indicated in the Group's wholesale credit model, the individual treatment of the client facilitates the continuous updating of information. The risk assumed must be followed and monitored throughout its life cycle, enabling anticipation and action to be taken in the event of possible impairments. In this way, the customer's credit quality is analysed individually, taking into account specific aspects such as his competitive position, financial performance, management, etc. In the wholesale risk management model, every customer with a credit risk position is assigned a rating, which has an associated probability of customer default. Thus, individual analysis of the debtor triggers a specific rating for each customer, which determines the appropriate parameters for calculating the expected loss, so that it is the rating itself that initially modulates the necessary coverage, adjusting the severity of the possible loss to the guarantees and other mitigating factors that the customer may have available. In addition, if as a result of this individualised monitoring of the customer, the analyst finally considers that his coverage is not sufficient, he has the necessary mechanisms to adjust it under his expert judgement, always under the appropriate governance.
h) Repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements. 
Purchases (sales) of financial instruments under a non-optional resale (repurchase) agreement at a fixed price (repos) are recognised in the consolidated balance sheet as financing granted (received), based on the nature of the debtor (creditor), under 'Loans and advances with central banks', 'Loans and advances to credit institutions' or 'Loans and advances to customers' (Deposits from central banks, Deposits from credit institutions or Customer deposits).
Differences between the purchase and sale prices are recognised as interest over the contract term.

Auditor's Consolidated Notes to the consolidated Contents report financial statements financial statements Appendix i) 'Non-current assets' and 'liabilities associated with non-current assets held for sale' 'Non-current assets held for sale' includes the carrying amount of individual items, disposal groups or items forming part of a business unit earmarked for disposal (discontinued operations), whose sale in their present condition is highly likely to be completed within one year from the reporting date. Therefore, the recovery of the carrying amount of these items -which can be of a financial nature or otherwise- will foreseeably be effected through the proceeds from their disposal.
Specifically, property or other non-current assets received by the consolidated entities as total or partial settlement of their debtors’ payment obligations to them are deemed to be 'Non-current assets held for sale', unless the consolidated entities have decided to make continuing use of these assets. In this connection, for the purpose of its consideration in the initial recognition of these assets, the Group obtains, at the foreclosure date, the fair value of the related asset through a request for appraisal by external appraisal agencies.
Grupo Santander has in place a corporate policy that ensures the professional competence and the independence and objectivity of the external appraisal agencies, in accordance with the regulations, which require appraisal agencies to meet independence, neutrality and credibility requirements, so that the use of their estimates does not reduce the reliability of its valuations. This policy establishes that all the appraisal companies and agencies with which the Group works in Spain should be registered in the Official Register of the Bank of Spain and that the appraisals performed by them should follow the methodology established in Ministry of Economy Order ECO/805/2003, of 27 March. The main appraisal companies and agencies with which the Group worked in Spain in 2021 are as follows: Gloval Valuation, S.A.U., Tinsa Tasaciones Inmobiliarias, S.A.U., Gesvalt Sociedad de Tasacion, S.A. and Sociedad de tasacion, S.A.
Also, this policy establishes that the various subsidiaries abroad work with appraisal companies that have recent experience in the area and the type of asset under appraisal and meet the independence requirements established in the corporate policy. They should verify, inter alia, that the appraisal company is not a party related to the Group and that its billings to the Group in the last twelve months do not exceed 15% of the appraisal company’s total billings.
'Liabilities associated with non-current assets held for sale' includes the balances payable arising from the assets held for sale or disposal groups and from discontinued operations.
'Non-current assets and disposal groups of items that have been classified as held for sale' are generally recognised at the date of their allocation to this category and are subsequently valued at the lower of their fair value less costs to sell or its book value. 'Noncurrent assets and disposal groups of items that are classified as held for sale' are not amortised as long as they remain in this category.
At 31 December 2021 the fair value less costs to sell of non-current assets held for sale exceeded their carrying amount by EUR 567 million (EUR 560 million at 31 December 2020); however, in accordance with the accounting standards, this unrealised gain could not be recognised.
The valuation of the portfolio of non-current assets held for sale has been made in compliance with the requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards in relation to the estimate of the fair value of tangible assets and the value-in-use of financial assets.
The value of the portfolio is determined as the sum of the values of the individual elements that compose the portfolio, without considering any total or batch grouping in order to correct the individual values.
Banco Santander, in compliance with Bank of Spain Circular 4/2017, and subsequent amendments, on public and private financial reporting standards and financial statement models, has developed a methodology that enables it to estimate the fair value and costs of sale of assets foreclosed or received in payment of debts. This methodology is based on the classification of the portfolio of foreclosed assets into different segments. Segmentation enables the intrinsic characteristics of Banco Santander's portfolio of foreclosed assets to be differentiated, so that assets with homogeneous characteristics are grouped by segment.
Thus, the portfolio is segmented into (i) finished assets of a residential and tertiary nature, (ii) developments in progress and (iii) land 1.
In determining the critical segments in the overall portfolio, assets are classified on the basis of the nature of the asset and its stage of development. This segmentation is made in order to seek the liquidation of the asset (which should be carried out in the shortest possible time).
When making decisions, the situation and/or characteristics of the asset are fundamentally taken into account, as well as the evaluation of all the determining factors that favour the recovery of the debt. For them, the following aspects are analyzed, among others: • The time that has elapsed since the adjudication.
• The transferability and contingencies of the foreclosed asset.
• The economic viability from the real estate point of view with the necessary investment estimate.
• The expenses that may arise from the marketing process.
• The offers received, as well as the difficulties in finding buyers.
1.The assets in a situation of 'stopped development' are included under 'land'

Auditor's Consolidated Notes to the consolidated Contents report financial statements financial statements Appendix. 
In the case of real estate assets foreclosed in Spain, which represent 91% of the Group’s total non-current assets held for sale, the valuation of the portfolio is carried out by applying the following models: • Market Value Model used in the valuation of finished properties of a residential nature (mainly homes and car parks) and properties of a tertiary nature (offices, commercial premises and multipurpose buildings). For the valuation of finished assets whose availability for sale is immediate, a market sale value provided by a third party external to Banco Santander is considered, calculated under the AVM methodology by the comparable properties method adjusted by our experience in selling similar assets, given the term, price, volume, trend in the value of these assets and the time elapsing until their sale and discounting the estimated costs of sale.
The market value is determined on the basis of the definition established by the International Valuation Standards drawn up by the IVSC (International Valuation Standards Council), understood as the estimated amount for which an asset or a liability should be exchanged on the measurement date between a willing buyer and a willing seller, in an arm's length transaction, after appropriate marketing, and in which the parties have acted with sufficient information, prudently and without coercion.
The current market value of the properties is estimated on the basis of automated valuations obtained by taking comparable properties as a reference; simulating the procedure carried out by an appraiser in a physical valuation according to Order ECO 805/2003: selection of properties and obtaining the unit value by applying homogenisation adjustments. The selection of the properties is carried out by location within the same real estate cluster and according to the characteristics of the properties, filtering by type 2, surface area range and age. The model enables a distinction to be made within the municipality under study as to which areas are similar and comparable and therefore have a similar value in the property market, discriminating between which properties are good comparators and which are not.
Adjustments to homogenize the properties are made according to: (i) the age of the property according to the age of the property to be valued, (ii) the deviation of the built area from the common area with respect to the property to be valued and (iii) by age of the date of capture of the property according to the price evolution index of the real estate market.
In addition, for individually significant assets, complete individual valuations are carried out, including a visit to the asset, market analysis (data relating to supply, demand, current sale or rental price ranges and supply-demand and revaluation expectations) and an estimate of expected income and costs.
2. Assets qualified as protected housing are taken into account. The maximum legal value of these assets is determined by the VPO module, obtained from the result of multiplying the State Basic Module (MBE) by a zone coefficient determined by each autonomous community. To carry out the valuation of a protected property, the useful surface area is used in accordance with current regulations.

Auditor's Consolidated Notes to the consolidated Contents report financial statements financial statements Appendix. 
For this segmentation of assets, when they are completed, the real costs are known and the actual expenses for the marketing and sale of the asset must be taken into account. Therefore, Banco Santander uses the actual costs in its calculation engine or, failing that, those estimated on the basis of its observed experience.
• Market Value Model according to Evolution of Market Values used to update the valuation of developments in progress. The valuation model estimates the current market value of the properties based on complete individual valuations by third parties, calculated from the values of the feasibility studies and development costs of the promotion, as well as the selling costs, distinguishing by location, size and type of property. The inputs used in the valuation model for residential assets under construction are actual revenues and costs.
For this purpose, in order to calculate the investment flows, Banco Santander considers, on the basis of the feasibility studies, the expenditure required for construction, the professional fees relating to the project and to project management, the premiums for mandatory building insurance, the developer's administrative expenses, licenses, taxes on new construction and fees, and urban development charges.
With respect to the calculation of income flows, Banco Santander takes into account the square metres built, the number of homes under construction and the estimated selling price over 1.5 years.
The market value will be the result of the difference between the income flows and the investment flows estimated at each moment.
• Land Valuation model. The methodology followed by the Group regarding land valuation consists of updating the individual reference valuation of each of the land on an annual basis, through updated valuation valuations carried out by independent professionals and following the methodology established in the OM (Ministerial Order) ECO/805/2003, of 27 March, whose main verifications in the case of land valuation, regardless of the degree of urbanisation of the land, correspond to: – Visual verification of the assessed property.
– Registry description.
– Urban planning.
– Visible easements.
– Visible state of occupation, possession, use and exploitation.
– Protection regime.
– Apparent state of preservation.
– Correspondence with cadastral property.
– Existence of expropriation procedure, expropriation plan or project, administrative resolution or file that may lead to expropriation.
– Expiry of the urbanization or building deadlines.
– Existence of a procedure for failure to comply with obligations.
– Verification of surfaces.
For the purposes of valuation, the land will be classified in the following levels: – Level I: It will include all the lands that do not belong to level II.
– Level II: It shall include land classified as undeveloped where building is not allowed for uses other than agriculture, forestry, livestock or linked to an economic exploitation permitted by the regulations in force. Also included are lands classified as developable that are not included in a development area of urban planning or that, in such an area, the conditions for its development have not been defined.
In those cases where the Group does not have an updated reference value through an ECO valuation for the current year, we use as a reference value the latest available ECO valuation reduced or corrected by the average annual coverage ratio of the land on which we have obtained an updated reference value, through an ECO valuation.
Grupo Santander applies a discount to the aforementioned reference values that takes into account both the discount on the reference value in the sales process and the estimated costs of marketing or selling the land:
Discount on reference value = % discount on sales + % marketing costs being: – % discount on Sales: = 100 - (sales price / updated appraisal value).
– marketing costs: calculated on the basis of our historical experience in sales and in accordance with the marketing management fees negotiated with our suppliers of this type of service.
In this way the Group obtains the corrected market value, an amount that we compare with the net cost of each piece of land to determine its correct valuation and conclude with our valuation process.
In addition, in relation to the previously mentioned valuations, less costs to sell, are contrasted with the sales experience of each type of asset in order to confirm that there is no significant difference between the sale price and the valuation.
Impairment losses on an asset or disposal group arising from a reduction in its carrying amount to its fair value (less costs to sell) are recognised under 'Gains or (losses) on non-current assets held for sale not classified as discontinued operations' in the consolidated income statement.
The gains on a non-current asset held for sale resulting from subsequent increases in fair value (less costs to sell) increase its carrying amount and are recognised in the consolidated income statement up to an amount equal to the impairment losses previously recognised.
j) Assets under insurance or reinsurance contracts and Liabilities under insurance or reinsurance contracts Insurance contracts involve the transfer of a certain quantifiable risk in exchange for a periodic or one-off premium. The effects on the Group’s cash flows will arise from a deviation in the payments forecast and/or an insufficiency in the premium set.
The Group controls its insurance risk as follows:
Annual report 2021 580


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 


Auditor's Consolidated Notes to the consolidated Contents report financial statements financial statements Appendix • By applying a strict methodology in the launch of products and in the assignment of value thereto.
• By using deterministic and stochastic actuarial models for measuring commitments.
• By using reinsurance as a risk mitigation technique as part of the credit quality guidelines in line with the Group’s general risk policy.
• By establishing an operating framework for credit risks.
• By actively managing asset and liability matching.
• By applying security measures in processes.
Reinsurance assets includes the amounts that the consolidated entities are entitled to receive for reinsurance contracts with third parties and, specifically, the reinsurer’s share of the technical provisions recorded by the consolidated insurance entities.
At least once a year these assets are reviewed to ascertain whether they are impaired (i.e. there is objective evidence, as a result of an event that occurred after initial recognition of the reinsurance asset, that Grupo Santander may not receive all amounts due to it under the terms of the contract and the amount that will not be received can be reliably measured), and any impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement and the assets are written down.
'Liabilities under insurance contracts' includes the technical provisions recorded by the consolidated entities to cover claims arising from insurance contracts in force at year-end.
Insurers’ results relating to their insurance business are recognised, according to their nature, under the related consolidated income statement items.
In accordance with standard accounting practice in the insurance industry, the consolidated insurance entities credit to the income statement the amounts of the premiums written and charge to income the cost of the claims incurred on final settlement thereof. Insurance entities are therefore required to accrue at period-end the unearned revenues credited to their income statements and the accrued costs not charged to income.
At least at each reporting date the Group assesses whether the insurance contract liabilities recognised in the consolidated balance sheet are adequate. For this purpose, it calculates the difference between the following amounts: • Current estimates of future cash flows under the insurance contracts of the consolidated entities. These estimates include all contractual cash flows and any related cash flows, such as claims handling costs.
• The carrying amount recognised in the consolidated balance sheet of its insurance contract liabilities (see note 15), less any related deferred acquisition costs or related intangible assets, such as the amount paid to acquire, in the event of purchase by the entity, the economic rights held by a broker deriving from policies in the entity’s portfolio.
If the calculation results in a positive amount, this deficiency is charged to the consolidated income statement. When unrealised gains or losses on assets of the Group’s insurance companies affect the measurement of liabilities under insurance contracts and/or the related deferred acquisition costs and/or the related intangible assets, these gains or losses are recognised directly in equity. The corresponding adjustment in the liabilities under insurance contracts (or in the deferred acquisition costs or in intangible assets) is also recognised in equity.
The most significant items forming part of the technical provisions (see note 15) are detailed below: • Non-life insurance provisions: i) Provision for unearned premiums: relates to the portion of the premiums received at year-end that is allocable to the period from the reporting date to the end of the policy cover period.
ii) Provisions for unexpired risks: this supplements the provision for unearned premiums to the extent that the amount of the latter is not sufficient to reflect all the assessed risks and expenses to be covered by the insurance companies in the policy period not elapsed at the reporting date.
• Life insurance provisions: represent the value of the net obligations acquired vis-à-vis life insurance policyholders. These provisions include: i) Provision for unearned premiums and unexpired risks: this relates to the portion of the premiums received at year-end that is allocable to the period from the reporting date to the end of the policy cover period.
ii) Mathematical provisions: these relate to the value of the insurance companies’ obligations, net of the policyholders’ obligations. These provisions are calculated on a policy-bypolicy basis using an individual capitalisation system, taking as a basis for the calculation the premium accrued in the year, and in accordance with the technical bases of each type of insurance updated, where appropriate, by the local mortality tables.
• Provision for claims outstanding: this reflects the total obligations outstanding arising from claims incurred prior to the reporting date. This provision is calculated as the difference between the total estimated or certain cost of the claims not yet reported, settled or paid and all the amounts already paid in relation to such claims.
• Provision for bonuses and rebates: this provision includes the amount of the bonuses accruing to policyholders, insureds or beneficiaries and that of any premiums to be returned to policyholders or insureds, to the extent that such amounts have not been assigned at the reporting date. These amounts are calculated on the basis of the conditions of the related individual policies.
• Technical provisions for life insurance policies where the investment risk is borne by the policyholders: these provisions are calculated on the basis of the indices established as a reference to determine the economic value of the policyholders’ rights.
k) Tangible assets Tangible assets includes the amount of buildings, land, furniture, vehicles, computer hardware and other fixtures owned by the consolidated entities or acquired under finance leases. Tangible assets are classified by use as follows: i. Property, plant and equipment for own use Property, plant and equipment for own use – including tangible assets received by the consolidated entities in full or partial.

Auditor's Consolidated Notes to the consolidated Contents report financial statements financial statements Appendix satisfaction of financial assets representing receivables from third parties which are intended to be held for continuing use and tangible assets acquired under finance leases– are presented at acquisition cost, less the related accumulated depreciation and any estimated impairment losses (carrying amount higher than recoverable amount).
Depreciation is calculated, using the straight-line method, on the basis of the acquisition cost of the assets less their residual value. The land on which the buildings and other structures stand has an indefinite life and, therefore, is not depreciated.
The period tangible asset depreciation charge is recognised in the consolidated income statement and is calculated using the following depreciation rates (based on the average years of estimated useful life of the various assets):
Average annual rate. 
Buildings for own use 2.7%
Furniture 8.5%
Fixtures 8.5%
Office and IT equipment 23.8%
Less than the lease term or the useful life Lease use rights of the underlying asset. 
At the end of each reporting period, consolidated entities assess whether there is any indication that the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, in which case they write down the carrying amount of the asset to its recoverable amount and adjust future depreciation charges in proportion to its adjusted carrying amount and to its new remaining useful life, if the useful life needs to be re-estimated.
Similarly, if there is an indication of a recovery in the value of a tangible asset, the consolidated entities recognise the reversal of the impairment loss recognised in prior periods and adjust the future depreciation charges accordingly. In no circumstances may the reversal of an impairment loss on an asset raise its carrying amount above that which it would have if no impairment losses had been recognised in prior years.
The estimated useful lives of the items of property, plant and equipment for own use are reviewed at least at the end of the reporting period with a view to detecting significant changes therein. If changes are detected, the useful lives of the assets are adjusted by correcting the depreciation charge to be recognised in the consolidated income statement in future years on the basis of the new useful lives.
Upkeep and maintenance expenses relating to property, plant and equipment for own use are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred, since they do not increase the useful lives of the assets.
ii. Investment property 'Investment property' reflects the net values of the land, buildings and other structures held either to earn rentals or for obtaining profits by sales due to future increase in market prices.
The criteria used to recognise the acquisition cost of investment property, to calculate its depreciation and its estimated useful life and to recognise any impairment losses thereon are consistent with those described in relation to property, plant and equipment for own use.
In order to evaluate the possible impairment Grupo Santander determines periodically the fair value of its investment property so that, at the end of the reporting period, the fair value reflects the market conditions of the investment property at that date. This fair value is determined annually, taking as benchmarks the valuations performed by independent experts. The methodology used to determine the fair value of investment property is selected based on the status of the asset in question; thus, for properties earmarked for lease, the valuations are performed using the sales comparison approach, whereas for leased properties the valuations are made primarily using the income capitalisation approach and, exceptionally, the sales comparison approach.
In the sales comparison approach, the property market segment for comparable properties is analysed, inter alia, and, based on specific information on actual transactions and firm offers, current prices are obtained for cash sales of those properties. The valuations performed using this approach are considered as level 2 valuations.
In the income capitalisation approach, the cash flows estimated to be obtained over the useful life of the property are discounted taking into account factors that may influence the amount and actual obtainment thereof, such as: (i) the payments that are normally received on comparable properties; (ii) current and probable future occupancy; (iii) the current or foreseeable default rate on payments. The valuations performed using this approach are considered as Level 3 valuations, since significant unobservable inputs are used, such as current and probable future occupancy and/or the current or foreseeable default rate on payments.
iii. Assets leased out under an operating lease 'Property, plant and equipment' - Leased out under an operating lease reflects the amount of the tangible assets, other than land and buildings, leased out by the Group under an operating lease.
The criteria used to recognise the acquisition cost of assets leased out under operating leases, to calculate their depreciation and their respective estimated useful lives and to recognise the impairment losses thereon are consistent with those described in relation to property, plant and equipment for own use.
l) Accounting for leases On 1 January 2019, Grupo Santander changed the accounting policy for leases when acting as a lessee (see note 1.d).
The main aspects contained in the regulation (IFRS 16) adopted by the Group are included below:
When the Group acts as lessee, it recognises a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying leased asset with a corresponding lease liability on the date on which the leased asset is available for use by the Group. Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and the finance charge. The finance charge is allocated to the income statement during the term of the lease in such a way as to produce a constant periodic interest rate on the remaining balance of the liability for each year. The right-of-use asset is depreciated over the useful life of the asset or the lease term, whichever is shorter, on a straight-line basis. If the Group is reasonably certain to exercise a purchase option, the right-of-use asset is amortized over the useful life of the underlying asset.
Annual report 2021 582


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Auditor's Consolidated Notes to the consolidated Contents report financial statements financial statements Appendix. 
Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured at present value. Lease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments: – Fixed payments (including inflation-linked payments), less any lease incentive receivable – Variable lease payments that depend on an index or rate.
– The amounts expected to be paid by the lessee under residual value guarantees.
– The exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably certain that it will exercise that option.
– Lease termination penalty payments, if the term of the lease reflects the lessee's exercise of that option.
Lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. Given in certain situations this interest rate cannot be obtained, the discount rate used in this cases, is the lessee's incremental borrowing rate at the related date. For this purpose, the entity has calculated this incremental borrowing rate taking as reference the listed debt instruments issued by the Group; in this regard, the Group has estimated different interest rate curves depending on the currency and economic environment in which the contracts are located.
In order to construct the incremental borrowing rate, a methodology has been developed at the corporate level. This methodology is based on the need for each entity to consider its economic and financial situation, for which the following factors must be considered: – Economic and political situation (country risk).
– Credit risk of the company.
– Monetary policy.
– Volume and seniority of the company’s debt instrument issues.
The incremental borrowing rate is defined as the interest rate that a lessee would have to pay for borrowing, given a similar period to the duration of the lease and with similar security, the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment. The Group entities have a wide stock and variety of financing instruments issued in different currencies to that of the euro (pound, dollar, etc.) that provide sufficient information to be able to determine an "all in rate" (reference rate plus adjustment for credit spread at different terms and in different currencies). In circumstances, where the leasing company has its own financing, this has been used as the starting point for determining the incremental borrowing rate. On the other hand, for those Grupo Santander entities that do not have their own financing, the information from the financing of the consolidated subgroup to which they belong was used as the starting point for estimating the entity's curve, analysing other factors to assess whether it is necessary to make any type of negative or positive adjustment to the initially estimated credit spread.
Right-of-use assets are valued at cost which includes the following: – The amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability.
– Any lease payment made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentive received.
– Any initial direct costs.
– Restoration costs.
The Group recognises the payments associated with short-term leases and leases of low-value assets on a straight-line basis as an expense in the income statement. Short-term leases are leases with a lease term less than or equal to 12 months (a lease that contains a purchase option is not a short term lease).
m) Intangible assets Intangible assets are identifiable non-monetary assets (separable from other assets) without physical substance which arise as a result of a legal transaction or which are developed internally by the consolidated entities.
Only assets whose cost can be estimated reliably and from which the consolidated entities consider it probable that future economic benefits will be generated are recognised.
Intangible assets are recognised initially at acquisition or production cost and are subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
i. Goodwill Any excess of the cost of the investments in the consolidated entities and entities accounted for using the equity method over the corresponding underlying carrying amounts acquired, adjusted at the date of first-time consolidation, is allocated as follows: • If it is attributable to specific assets and liabilities of the companies acquired, by increasing the value of the assets (or reducing the value of the liabilities) whose fair values were higher (lower) than the carrying amounts at which they had been recognised in the acquired entities’ balance sheets.
▪ If it is attributable to specific intangible assets, by recognising it explicitly in the consolidated balance sheet provided that the fair value of these assets within twelve months following the date of acquisition can be measured reliably.
▪ The remaining amount is recognised as goodwill, which is allocated to one or more cash-generating units (CGUs) (a cashgenerating unit is the smallest identifiable group of assets that, as a result of continuing operation, generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets). The cash-generating units represent the Group’s geographical and/or business segments.
Goodwill (only recognised when it has been acquired by consideration) represents, therefore, a payment made by the acquirer in anticipation of future economic benefits from assets of the acquired entity that are not capable of being individually identified and separately recognised.
At the end of each annual reporting period or whenever there is any indication of impairment goodwill is reviewed for impairment (i.e. a reduction in its recoverable amount to below its carrying amount) and, if there is any impairment, the goodwill is written down with a charge to 'Impairment or reversal of impairment on non-financial assets, net - Intangible assets' in the consolidated income statement.

Auditor's Consolidated Notes to the consolidated Contents report financial statements financial statements Appendix. 
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
In the event of sale or departure of an activity that is part of a CGU, the part of the goodwill that can be assigned to said activity would be written-off, taking as a reference the relative value of the same over the total of the CGU at the time of sale or abandonment. If applicable, the distribution by currency of the remaining goodwill will be performed based on the relative values of the remaining activities.
ii. Other intangible assets Other intangible assets includes the amount of identifiable intangible assets, such as purchased customer lists and computer software.
Other intangible assets can have an indefinite useful life -when, based on an analysis of all the relevant factors, it is concluded that there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which the asset is expected to generate net cash inflows for the consolidated entities- or a finite useful life, in all other cases.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortised, but rather at the end of each reporting period or whenever there is any indication of impairment the consolidated entities review the remaining useful lives of the assets in order to determine whether they continue to be indefinite and, if this is not the case, to take the appropriate steps.
Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortised over those useful lives using methods similar to those used to depreciate tangible assets.
The intangible asset amortisation charge is recognised under 'Depreciation and amortisation' in the consolidated income statement.
In both cases the consolidated entities recognise any impairment loss on the carrying amount of these assets with a charge to 'Impairment or reversal of impairment on non-financial assets, net - Intangible assets in the consolidated' income statement.
The criteria used to recognise the impairment losses on these assets and, where applicable, the reversal of impairment losses recognised in prior years are similar to those used for tangible assets (see note 2.k).
Internally developed computer software Internally developed computer software is recognised as an intangible asset if, among other requisites (basically the Group’s ability to use or sell it), it can be identified and its ability to generate future economic benefits can be demonstrated.
Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the year in which it is incurred and cannot be subsequently capitalised into the carrying amount of the intangible asset.
n) Other assets 'Other assets' in the consolidated balance sheet includes the amount of assets not recorded in other items, the breakdown being as follows: ▪ Inventories: this item includes the amount of assets, other than financial instruments, that are held for sale in the ordinary course of business, that are in the process of production, construction or development for such purpose, or that are to be consumed in the production process or in the provision of services. Inventories include land and other property held for sale in the property development business.
Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value, which is the estimated selling price of the inventories in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs required to make the sale.
Any write-downs of inventories -such as those due to damage, obsolescence or reduction of selling price- to net realisable value and other impairment losses are recognised as expenses for the year in which the impairment or loss occurs. Subsequent reversals are recognised in the consolidated income statement for the year in which they occur.
The carrying amount of inventories is derecognised and recognised as an expense in the period in which the revenue from their sale is recognised.
▪ Other: this item includes the balance of all prepayments and accrued income (excluding accrued interest, fees and commissions), the net amount of the difference between pension plan obligations and the value of the plan assets with a balance in the entity’s favour, when this net amount is to be reported in the consolidated balance sheet, and the amount of any other assets not included in other items.
o) Other liabilities 'Other liabilities' includes the balance of all accrued expenses and deferred income, excluding accrued interest, and the amount of any other liabilities not included in other categories.
p) Provisions and contingent assets and liabilities When preparing the financial statements of the consolidated entities, Banco Santander’s directors made a distinction between: • Provisions: credit balances covering present obligations at the reporting date arising from past events which could give rise to a loss for the consolidated entities, which is considered to be likely to occur and certain as to its nature but uncertain as to its amount and/or timing.
▪ Contingent liabilities: possible obligations that arise from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more future events not wholly within the control of the consolidated entities. They include the present obligations of the consolidated entities when it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle them. The Group does not recognise the contingent liability. The Group will disclose a contingent liability, unless the possibility of an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is remote.

Auditor's Consolidated Notes to the consolidated Contents report financial statements financial statements Appendix. 
Santander UK plc is cooperating with an FCA civil regulatory investigation which commenced in July 2017 into its compliance with the Money Laundering Regulations 2007 and potential breaches of FCA principles and rules relating to anti-money laundering and financial crime systems and controls. The FCA’s investigation focuses primarily on the period 2012 to 2017 and includes consideration of high risk customers including Money Service Businesses. It is not currently possible to make a reliable assessment of any liability resulting from the investigation including any financial penalty.
▪ Contingent assets: possible assets that arise from past events and whose existence is conditional on, and will be confirmed only by, the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Group. Contingent assets are not recognised in the consolidated balance sheet or in the consolidated income statement, but rather are disclosed in the notes, provided that it is probable that these assets will give rise to an increase in resources embodying economic benefits.
Grupo Santander’s consolidated financial statements include all the material provisions with respect to which it is considered that it is more likely than not the obligation will have to be settled. In accordance with accounting standards, contingent liabilities must not be recognised in the consolidated financial statements, but must rather be disclosed in the Notes.
Provisions (which are quantified on the basis of the best information available on the consequences of the event giving rise to them and are reviewed and adjusted at the end of each year) are used to cater for the specific obligations for which they were originally recognised. Provisions are fully or partially reversed when such obligations cease to exist or are reduced.
Provisions are classified according to the obligations covered as follows (see note 25): ▪ Provision for pensions and similar obligations: includes the amount of all the provisions made to cover post-employment benefits, including obligations to pre-retirees and similar obligations.
▪ Provisions for contingent liabilities and commitments: include the amount of the provisions made to cover contingent liabilities defined as those transactions in which the Group guarantees the obligations of a third party, arising as a result of financial guarantees granted or contracts of another kind- and contingent commitments -defined as irrevocable commitments that may give rise to the recognition of financial assets.
▪ Provisions for taxes and other legal contingencies and Other provisions: include the amount of the provisions recognised to cover tax and legal contingencies and litigation and the other provisions recognised by the consolidated entities. Other provisions includes, inter alia, any provisions for restructuring costs and environmental measures.
q) Court proceedings and/or claims in process At the end of 2021 certain court proceedings and claims were in process against the consolidated entities arising from the ordinary course of their operations (see note 25).
r) Own equity instruments Own equity instruments are those meeting both of the following conditions: ▪ The instruments do not include any contractual obligation for the issuer (i) to deliver cash or another financial asset to a third party; or (ii) to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with a third party under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the issuer.
▪ The instruments will or may be settled in the issuer’s own equity instruments and are: (i) a non-derivative that includes no contractual obligation for the issuer to deliver a variable number of its own equity instruments; or (ii) a derivative that will be settled by the issuer through the exchange of a fixed amount of cash or another financial asset for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.
Transactions involving own equity instruments, including their issuance and cancellation, are charged directly to equity.
Changes in the value of instruments classified as own equity instruments are not recognised in the consolidated financial statements. Consideration received or paid in exchange for such instruments, including the coupons on preference shares contingently convertible into ordinary shares and the coupons associated with CCPP, is directly added to or deducted from equity.
s) Equity-instrument-based employee remuneration Own equity instruments delivered to employees in consideration for their services, if the instruments are delivered once the specific period of service has ended, are recognised as an expense for services (with the corresponding increase in equity) as the services are rendered by employees during the service period. At the grant date the services received (and the related increase in equity) are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments granted. If the equity instruments granted are vested immediately, Grupo Santander recognises in full, at the grant date, the expense for the services received.
When the requirements stipulated in the remuneration agreement include external market conditions (such as equity instruments reaching a certain quoted price), the amount ultimately to be recognised in equity will depend on the other conditions being met by the employees (normally length of service requirements), irrespective of whether the market conditions are satisfied. If the conditions of the agreement are met but the external market conditions are not satisfied, the amounts previously recognised in equity are not reversed, even if the employees do not exercise their right to receive the equity instruments.
t) Recognition of income and expenses The most significant criteria used by Grupo Santander to recognise its income and expenses are summarised as follows: i. Interest income, interest expenses and similar items Interest income, interest expenses and similar items are generally recognised on an accrual basis using the effective interest method. Dividends received from other companies are recognised as income when the consolidated entities’ right to receive them arises.
ii. Commissions, fees and similar items Fee and commission income and expenses are recognised in the consolidated income statement using criteria that vary according to their nature. The main criteria are as follows: ▪ Fee and commission income and expenses relating to financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss are recognised when paid.
Annual report 2021 585


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 


Auditor's Consolidated Notes to the consolidated Contents report financial statements financial statements Appendix ▪ Those arising from transactions or services that are performed over a period of time are recognised over the life of these transactions or services.
▪ Those relating to services provided in a single act are recognised when the single act is carried out.
iii. Non-finance income and expenses They are recognised for accounting purposes when the good is delivered or the non-financial service is rendered. To determine the amount and timing of recognition, a five-step model is followed: identification of the contract with the customer, identification of the separate obligations of the contract, determination of the transaction price, distribution of the transaction price among the identified obligations and finally recording of income as the obligations are satisfied.
iv. Deferred collections and payments These are recognised for accounting purposes at the amount resulting from discounting the expected cash flows at market rates.
v. Loan arrangement fees Loan arrangement fees, mainly loan origination, application and information fees, are accrued and recognised in income over the term of the loan.
u) Financial guarantees Financial guarantees are defined as contracts whereby an entity undertakes to make specific payments on behalf of a third party if the latter fails to do so, irrespective of the various legal forms they may have, such as guarantees, insurance policies or credit derivatives.
Grupo Santander initially recognises the financial guarantees provided on the liability side of the consolidated balance sheet at fair value, which is generally the present value of the fees, commissions and interest receivable from these contracts over the term thereof, and simultaneously the Group recognises the amount of the fees, commissions and similar interest received at the inception of the transactions and a credit on the asset side of the consolidated balance sheet for the present value of the fees, commissions and interest outstanding.
Financial guarantees, regardless of the guarantor, instrumentation or other circumstances, are reviewed periodically so as to determine the credit risk to which they are exposed and, if appropriate, to consider whether a provision is required. The credit risk is determined by application of criteria similar to those established for quantifying impairment losses on debt instruments carried at amortised cost (described in note 2.g above).
The provisions made for these transactions are recognised under 'Provisions - Provisions for commitments and guarantees given in the consolidated balance sheet' (see note 25). These provisions are recognised and reversed with a charge or credit, respectively, to 'Provisions or reversal of provisions', net, in the consolidated income statement.
If a specific provision is required for financial guarantees, the related unearned commissions recognised under 'Financial liabilities at amortised cost - Other financial liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet', are reclassified to the appropriate provision.
v) Assets under management and investment and pension funds managed by the Group Assets owned by third parties and managed by the consolidated entities are not presented on the face of the consolidated balance sheet. Management fees are included in 'Fee and commission income' in the consolidated income statement.
The investment funds and pension funds managed by the consolidated entities are not presented on the face of the Group’s consolidated balance sheet since the related assets are owned by third parties. The fees and commissions earned in the year for the services rendered by the Group entities to these funds (asset management and custody services) are recognised under Fee and 'Commission income' in the consolidated income statement.
Note 2.b.iv describes the internal criteria and procedures used to determine whether control exists over the structured entities, which include, inter alia, investment funds and pension funds.
w) Post-employment benefits Under the collective agreements currently in force and other arrangements, the Spanish banks included in the Group and certain other Spanish and foreign consolidated entities have undertaken to supplement the public social security system benefits accruing to certain employees, and to their beneficiary right holders, for retirement, permanent disability or death, and the post-employment welfare benefits.
Grupo Santander's post-employment obligations to its employees are deemed to be defined contribution plans when the Group makes pre-determined contributions (recognised under Personnel expenses in the consolidated income statement) to a separate entity and will have no legal or effective obligation to make further contributions if the separate entity cannot pay the employee benefits relating to the service rendered in the current and prior periods. Post-employment obligations that do not meet the aforementioned conditions are classified as defined benefit plans (see note 25).
Defined contribution plans The contributions made in this connection in each year are recognised under 'Personnel expenses' in the consolidated income statement.
The amounts not yet contributed at each year-end are recognised, at their present value, under 'Provisions - Provision for pensions' and similar obligations on the liability side of the consolidated balance sheet.
Defined benefit plans Grupo Santander recognises under 'Provisions - Provision for pensions and similar obligations on the liability side of the consolidated balance sheet' (or under 'Other assets' on the asset side, as appropriate) the present value of its defined benefit postemployment obligations, net of the fair value of the plan assets.
Plan assets are defined as those that will be directly used to settle obligations and that meet the following conditions: ▪ They are not owned by the consolidated entities, but by a legally separate third party that is not a party related to the Group.
▪ They are only available to pay or fund post-employment benefits and they cannot be returned to the consolidated entities unless the assets remaining in the plan are sufficient to meet all the benefit obligations of the plan and of the entity to current and former.

Auditor's Consolidated Notes to the consolidated Contents report financial statements financial statements Appendix employees, or they are returned to reimburse employee benefits already paid by Grupo Santander.
If Grupo Santander can look to an insurer to pay part or all of the expenditure required to settle a defined benefit obligation, and it is practically certain that said insurer will reimburse some or all of the expenditure required to settle that obligation, but the insurance policy does not qualify as a plan asset, the Group recognises its right to reimbursement -which, in all other respects, is treated as a plan asset- under 'Insurance contracts linked to pensions' on the asset side of the consolidated balance sheet.
Grupo Santander will recognise the following items in the income statement: • Current service cost, (the increase in the present value of the obligations resulting from employee service in the current period), is recognised under 'Staff costs'.
• The past service cost, which arises from changes to existing postemployment benefits or from the introduction of new benefits and includes the cost of reductions, is recognised under 'Provisions or reversal of provisions'.
• Any gain or loss arising from a liquidation of the plan is included in the Provisions or reversion of provisions.
• Net interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset), i.e. the change during the period in the net defined benefit liability (asset) that arises from the passage of time, is recognised under 'Interest expense' and similar charges ('Interest and similar income' if it constitutes income) in the consolidated income statement.
The remeasurement of the net defined benefit liability (asset) is recognised in 'Other comprehensive income' under Items not reclassified to profit or loss and includes: ▪ Actuarial gains and losses generated in the year, arising from the differences between the previous actuarial assumptions and what has actually occurred and from the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions.
▪ The return on plan assets, excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset).
▪ Any change in the effect of the asset ceiling, excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset).
x) Other long-term employee benefits Other long-term employee benefits, defined as obligations to preretirees -taken to be those who have ceased to render services at the entity but who, without being legally retired, continue to have economic rights vis-à-vis the entity until they acquire the legal status of retiree-, long-service bonuses, obligations for death of spouse or disability before retirement that depend on the employee’s length of service at the entity and other similar items, are treated for accounting purposes, where applicable, as established above for defined benefit post-employment plans, except that actuarial gains and losses are recognised under 'Provisions or reversal of provisions', net, in the consolidated income statement (see note 25).
y) Termination benefits Termination benefits are recognised when there is a detailed formal plan identifying the basic changes to be made, provided that implementation of the plan has begun, its main features have been publicly announced or objective facts concerning its implementation have been disclosed.
z) Income tax The expense for Spanish income tax and other similar taxes applicable to the foreign consolidated entities is recognised in the consolidated income statement, except when they arise from a transaction whose results are recognised directly in equity, in which case the related tax effect is recognised in equity.
The current income tax expense is calculated as the sum of the current tax resulting from application of the appropriate tax rate to the taxable profit for the year (net of any deductions allowable for tax purposes), and of the changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities recognised in the consolidated income statement.
'Deferred tax assets' and liabilities include temporary differences, which are identified as the amounts expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their related tax bases, and tax loss and tax credit carryforwards. These amounts are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled.
'Tax assets' include the amount of all tax assets, which are broken down into current -amounts of tax to be recovered within the next twelve months- and deferred -amounts of tax to be recovered in future years, including those arising from tax loss or tax credit carryforwards.
'Tax liabilities' includes the amount of all tax liabilities (except provisions for taxes), which are broken down into current -the amount payable in respect of the income tax on the taxable profit for the year and other taxes in the next twelve months- and deferred the amount of income tax payable in future years.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures, except when the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and, in addition, it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. In this regard, no deferred tax liabilities of EUR 317.4 million were recognised in relation to the taxation that would arise from the undistributed earnings of certain Group holding companies, in accordance with the legislation applicable in those jurisdictions.
Deferred tax assets are only recognised for temporary differences to the extent that it is considered probable that the consolidated entities will have sufficient future taxable profits against which the deferred tax assets can be utilised, and the deferred tax assets do not arise from the initial recognition (except in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither taxable profit nor accounting profit. Other deferred tax assets (tax loss and tax credit carryforwards) are only recognised if it is considered probable that the consolidated entities will have sufficient future taxable profits against which they can be utilised.
Differences generated by the different accounting and tax treatment of any of the income and expenses recorded directly in equity to be paid or recovered in the future are accounted for as temporary differences.

The deferred tax assets and liabilities are reassessed at the reporting date in order to ascertain whether any adjustments need to be made on the basis of the findings of the analyses performed.
aa) Residual maturity periods The analysis of the maturities of the balances of certain items in the consolidated balance sheet.
ab) Consolidated statement of recognised income and expense This statement presents the income and expenses generated by the Group as a result of its business activity in the year, and a distinction is made between the income and expenses recognised in the consolidated income statement for the year and the other income and expenses recognised directly in consolidated equity.
Accordingly, this statement presents: a. Consolidated profit for the year.
b. The net amount of the income and expenses recognised in 'Other comprehensive income' under items that will not be reclassified to profit or loss.
c. The net amount of the income and expenses recognised in Other comprehensive income under items that may be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss.
d. The income tax incurred in respect of the items indicated in b and c above, except for the valuation adjustments arising from investments in associates or joint ventures accounted for using the equity method, which are presented net.
e. Total consolidated recognised income and expense, calculated as the sum of a) to d) above, presenting separately the amount attributable to the parent company and the amount relating to non-controlling interests.
The statement presents the items separately by nature, grouping together items that, in accordance with the applicable accounting standards, will not be reclassified subsequently to profit and loss since the requirements established by the corresponding accounting standards are met.
ac) Statement of changes in total equity This statement presents all the changes in equity, including those arising from changes in accounting policies and from the correction of errors. Accordingly, this statement presents a reconciliation of the carrying amount at the beginning and end of the year of all the consolidated equity items, and the changes are grouped together on the basis of their nature into the following items: a. Adjustments due to changes in accounting policies and to errors: include the changes in consolidated equity arising as a result of the retrospective restatement of the balances in the consolidated financial statements, distinguishing between those resulting from changes in accounting policies and those relating to the correction of errors.
b. Income and expense recognised in the year: includes, in aggregate form, the total of the aforementioned items recognised in the consolidated statement of recognised 'Income and expense'.
c. Other changes in equity: includes the remaining items recognised in equity, including, inter alia, increases and decreases in capital, distribution of profit, transactions involving own equity instruments, equity-instrument-based payments, transfers between equity items and any other increases or decreases in consolidated equity.
ad) Consolidated statement of cash flows The following terms are used in the consolidated statements of cash flows with the meanings specified: • Cash flows: inflows and outflows of cash and cash equivalents, which are short-term, highly liquid investments that are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value, irrespective of the portfolio in which they are classified.
Grupo Santander classifies as cash and cash equivalents the balances recognised under 'Cash, cash balances at central banks' and 'Other deposits on demand' in the consolidated balance sheet.
• Operating activities: the principal revenue-producing activities of credit institutions and other activities that are not investing or financing activities.
• Investing activities: the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments not included in cash and cash equivalents.
• Financing activities: activities that result in changes in the size and composition of the equity and liabilities that are not operating activities.
During 2021 Grupo Santander received interest amounting to EUR 48,081 million (EUR 43,953 million and EUR 55,269 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively) and paid interest amounting to EUR 12,738 million (EUR 13,690 million and EUR 20,671 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively).
Also, dividends received and paid by the Group are detailed in notes 4, 28 and 40, including dividends paid to minority interests (noncontrolling interests).
3. Grupo Santander a) Banco Santander, S.A., and international Group structure The growth of Grupo Santander in the last decades has led Banco Santander to also act, in practice, as a holding entity of the shares of the various companies in its Group, and its results are becoming progressively less representative of the performance and earnings of the Group. Therefore, each year the bank determines the amount of the dividends to be distributed to its shareholders on the basis of the consolidated net profit, while maintaining the Group’s objectives of capitalisation and taking into account that the transactions of the Bank and of the rest of the Group are managed on a consolidated basis (notwithstanding the allocation to each company of the related net worth effect).
At the international level, the various banks and other subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates of the Group are integrated in a corporate structure comprising various holding companies which are the ultimate shareholders of the banks and subsidiaries abroad.

The purpose of this structure, all of which is controlled Banco Santander, is to optimise the international organisation from the strategic, economic, financial and tax standpoints, since it makes it possible to define the most appropriate units to be entrusted with acquiring, selling or holding stakes in other international entities, the most appropriate financing method for these transactions and the most appropriate means of remitting the profits obtained by the group’s various operating units to Spain.
The Appendices provide relevant data on the consolidated group companies and on the companies accounted for using the equity method.
b) Acquisitions and disposals Following is a summary of the main acquisitions and disposals of ownership interests in the share capital of other entities and other significant corporate transactions performed in the last three years or pending to be completed: i. Purchase by SHUSA for shares of Santander Consumer USA In August 2021 Santander Holdings USA, Inc. ('SHUSA') and Santander Consumer USA Holdings Inc. ('SC') entered into a definitive agreement pursuant to which SHUSA acquired all outstanding shares of common stock of SC not already owned by SHUSA via an all-cash tender offer (the 'Tender Offer') for USD 41.50 per SC common share (the 'Offer Price'), followed by a second-step consisting of a merge (together with the Offer, the 'Transaction') in which a wholly owned subsidiary of SHUSA was merged with and into SC, with SC surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of SHUSA, and all outstanding shares of common stock of SC not tendered in the Tender Offer were converted into the right to receive the Offer Price in cash. The Offer Price represented a 14% premium to the closing price of SC common stock of USD 36.43 as of 1 July 2021, the last day prior to the announcement of SHUSA’s initial offer to acquire the remaining outstanding shares of SC’s common stock.
On 31 January 2022, after completion of the customary closing conditions, the Transaction was performed and SHUSA increased its share up to the 100% of SC's common stock. The transaction has meant a disbursement of USD 2,510 million (around EUR 2,239 million) for the Group.
ii. Acquisition of Amherst Pierpont, a U.S. fixed-income broker dealer On 15 July 2021, Santander Holdings USA, Inc. reached an agreement to acquire Amherst Pierpont Securities, a market-leading independent fixed-income and structured products broker dealer, through the acquisition of its parent holding company, Pierpont Capital Holdings LLC, for a total consideration of approximately USD 600 million (around EUR 530 million). Amherst Pierpont will become part of Santander Corporate & Investment Banking (Santander CIB) Global business line.
The transaction is expected to close upon receipt of relevant regulatory approvals.
iii Tender offer for shares of Banco Santander México, S.A., Institución de Banca Múltiple, Grupo Financiero Santander México. 
On 26 March 2021, Banco Santander, S.A. announced its intention to make a tender offer for all shares of Banco Santander Mexico, S.A., Institución de Banca Múltiple, Grupo Financiero Santander México ('Santander México') that were not owned by Grupo Santander, representing (after the execution of the operation referred to in point vii. below) approximately 8.3% of the share capital of Santander México. The announcement was subsequently supplemented by other publications on 24 May, 8 June and 28 October 2021, in which amendments to some of the terms of the offer were announced.
The offer was finally launched on 3 November 2021 and was settled on 10 December. Banco Santander accepted all of the Santander Mexico Shares and Santander Mexico American Depositary Share (ADS) (securities listed on the New York Stock Exchange, each representing 5 shares of Santander Mexico) tendered and not withdrawn representing approximately 4.5% of the share capital of Santander México. After the transaction, Santander Group holds approximately 96.2% of Santander México share capital.
The shareholders who have tendered their shares in the offer have received MXN 26.5 (approximately EUR 1) per share of Santander México and USD 6.2486 in cash per each ADS (the USD equivalent of MXN 132.50 per ADS based on the USD/MXN exchange rate on the expiration date of 7 December 2021) which has meant a disbursement of approximately EUR 335 million.
This transaction has entailed a decrease of reserves of EUR 41 million and a decrease of EUR 294 million of minority interests.
iv.Agreement for the acquisition of a significant stake in Ebury On 28 April 2020, the investment in Ebury, a payments and currencies platform for SMEs, announced on 4 November 2019, was completed. The transaction involved a total outlay of GBP 357 million (EUR 409 million) of which GBP 70 million (approximately EUR 80 million) was for new shares. At 2019 year-end the Group had already acquired 6.4% of the company for GBP 40 million (approximately EUR 45 million). Following the disbursement made in April 2020, the Group is entitled to receive 50.38% of the dividends distributed by the company. This interest is recognized under 'Investments in Joint Ventures and Associates - Associates' in the consolidated balance sheet.
v. Reorganization of the banking insurance business, asset management and pension plans in Spain On 24 June 2019, Banco Santander, S.A., reached an agreement with the Allianz Group to terminate the agreement that Banco Popular Español, S.A.U. ('Banco Popular') held in Spain with the Allianz Group for the exclusive distribution of certain life insurance products, nonlife insurance products, collective investment institutions (IIC), and pension plans through the Banco Popular network (the 'Agreement'). Under this Agreement, the Group held a 40% stake in the capital of Popular Spain Holding de Inversiones, S.L.U., classified as investments in joint ventures and associated entities for an overall amount of EUR 409 million on 31 December 2019.

Auditor's Consolidated Notes to the consolidated Contents report financial statements financial statements Appendix. 
The Agreement was executed on 15 January 2020 for the non-life business and on 31 January 2020 for the remaining businesses, once the regulatory authorisations were obtained in the first half of 2020. The execution of the Termination Agreement entailed the payment by Banco Santander of a total consideration of EUR 859 million (after deducting the dividends paid until the end of the operation) and the acquisition of the remaining 60% of the capital of Popular Spain Holding de Inversiones, S.L.U.
On 10 July, 51% of the life-risk insurance business held by Banco Santander and the 51% of the new General Insurance business from Banco Popular's network not transferred to Mapfre (in accordance with the agreement indicated below) was acquired by Aegon, valuing these businesses at a total of approximately EUR 557 million.
The total amount of the life-savings business, collective investment institutions and pension plans is EUR 711 million and has resulted in the recognition of EUR 271 million of goodwill.
In addition, under the agreement reached between Banco Santander and Mapfre on 21 January 2019, 50.01% of the car, commercial multi-risk, SME multi-risk and corporate liability insurance business in the whole network of Banco Santander in Spain was acquired by Mapfre on 25 June 2019 amounting to EUR 82 million.
vi. Agreement with Crédit Agricole S.A. on the depositary and custody business. 
On 17 April 2019, Banco Santander, S.A., announced that it had signed a memorandum of understanding with Crédit Agricole S.A. with the purpose of combining CACEIS and its subsidiaries (the 'CACEIS Group'), which is wholly-owned by Crédit Agricole S.A., with Santander Securities Services, S.A.U. and its subsidiaries (the 'S3 Group'), which is wholly-owned by Banco Santander, S.A.
The operation consisted of the contribution by the Santander Group to the CACEIS Group of 100% of the S3 Group in Spain and 50% of the S3 Group's business in Latin America in exchange for a 30.5% stake in the CACEIS Group Capital and voting rights. The remaining 69.5% remained the property of Crédit Agricole, SA. The S3 Group's Latin American business is under the joint control of the CACEIS Group and the Santander Group.
On 27 June 2019, the signing of the final contracts took place after having carried out the precise prior consultations with the representative bodies of Crédit Agricole, SA employees and the CACEIS Group. The closing of the operation took place on 20 December 2019 once the relevant regulatory authorizations were obtained.
The operation generated a net capital gain of EUR 693 million recorded for its gross amount under the heading of 'Non-classified assets as non-current assets for sale' of the consolidated profit and loss account, of which EUR 219 million correspond to the recognition at fair value of the investment of 49.99% retained by the Group in S3 Latin America. The 30.5% interest in the CACEIS Group was recorded under the heading of 'Investments - Associates' of the consolidated balance sheet for an amount of EUR 1,010 million.
vii . Offer to acquire shares of Banco Santander Mexico, S.A., Institución de Banca Multiple, Grupo Financiero Santander México.
On 12 April 2019, Banco Santander, S.A., announced its intention to make an offer to acquire all the shares of Banco Santander Mexico, S.A., Institución de Banca Múltiple, Grupo Financiero Santander México ('Santander México') which are not owned by Grupo Santander, representing approximately 25% of the share capital of Santander México.
The shareholders who have accepted the offer have received 0.337 newly issued shares of Banco Santander, S.A., per share of Santander México and 1.685 American Depositary Shares (ADSs) of Banco Santander, S.A., per ADS of Santander México.
The offer was accepted by holders of shares representing 16.69% of the capital stock of Santander Mexico, so the Group's participation in Santander Mexico became 91.65% of its share capital. To meet the exchange, the Bank proceeded to issue, in execution of the agreement adopted by the extraordinary general meeting held on 23 July 2019, 381,540,640 shares, which represented approximately 2.35% of the Bank's share capital in the date of issue. This operation meant an increase of EUR 191 million in Capital, EUR 1,491 million in issue premium and a decrease of EUR 670 million in Reserves and EUR 1,012 million in minority interests.
c) Offshore entities. 
According to current Spanish regulation (Law 11/2021, of 9 July and Royal Decree 1080/1991, of 5 July), Santander has one subsidiary and three branches in the non-cooperative jurisdictions of Jersey, the Isle of Man and the Cayman Islands (offshore entities). Santander also has three other subsidiaries incorporated in non-cooperative jurisdictions that are tax resident in the UK and subject to British tax law.
i. Offshore subsidiaries A subsidiary resident in the Isle of Man was liquidated in 2021 so, at the reporting date, Grupo Santander has only one subsidiary resident in Jersey: Abbey National International Limited. In 2021, this subsidiary’s contribution to Santander’s consolidated profit was insubstantial.
ii. Offshore branches Grupo Santander also has three offshore branches. One is found in the Cayman Islands, one is on the Isle of Man and another is in Jersey. They report to, and consolidate balance sheets and income statements with, their foreign headquarters. They are taxed either with their headquarters (the Cayman Islands branch in Brazil) or in the territories they are located in (Jersey and Isle of Man, pertain to the UK).
The entities mentioned in Sections I and II had 147 employees as of December 2021.
iii. Subsidiaries in non-cooperative jurisdictions that are tax resident in the United Kingdom Grupo Santander also has three subsidiaries (one in liquidation) that were incorporated in offshore jurisdictions but are not deemed offshore entities. They only operate from, and are tax resident in, the UK and, thus, are subject to British tax law.

Auditor's Consolidated Notes to the consolidated Contents report financial statements financial statements Appendix iv. Other offshore holdings From Brazil, Grupo Santander manages Santander Brazil Global Investment Fund SPC, a segregated portfolio company located in the Cayman Islands. It also has two small financial investments in entities located in the Cayman Islands. In 2021, Guaranteed Investment Products 1 PCC Limited, a protected cell company found in Guernsey managed from the UK, was liquidated.
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Grupo Santander is not in any of the non-cooperative jurisdictions the OECD released in November 2021. Furthermore, Jersey, the Isle of Man and the Cayman Islands satisfy OECD standards on transparency and exchange of information for tax purposes.
The European Union (EU) As of October 2021, the EU’s blacklist comprises 9 jurisdictions where Santander is not present. Additionally, the EU’s grey list comprises 15 jurisdictions which have sufficiently committed to adapt legislation to international standards, subject to monitoring by the EU. Within these jurisdictions, Santander is only present in Uruguay and Hong Kong mainly through Banco Santander S.A. in Uruguay and a branch in Hong Kong.
The Group's presence in offshore territories at the end of 2021 is as follows:

Changes to Spain's tax law. 
On 10 July 2021, Law 11/2021 on measures to prevent and fight against tax fraud was published in the Official Estate Gazette. The law expands the meaning of tax havens, which it renames “noncooperative jurisdictions”. It also allows government to update the non-cooperative jurisdictions list. Nonetheless, until that list conforms to the new criteria, the former list set out in Royal Decree 1080/1991 of 5 July will remain in effect.
Grupo Santander has the right mechanisms (risk management, supervision, verification and review plans, and regular reporting) to prevent reputational, tax and legal risk in entities resident in noncooperative jurisdictions. Grupo Santander also maintains its policy of reducing the number of these entities.
PwC (PricewaterhouseCoopers) member firms audited the financial statements of Grupo Santander’s offshore entities in 2021, 2020 and 2019.
4. Distribution of Banco Santander's profit, shareholder remuneration scheme and earnings per share a) Distribution of Banco Santander's profit and shareholder remuneration scheme. 
The distribution of the Bank's net profit against the results for 2021, that the board of directors will propose for approval by the shareholders at the annual general meeting is as follows:
EUR million. 
To dividends 1,701. 
Dividend paid prior to the meeting date* 836. 
Complementary dividend** 865. 
To voluntary reserves*** 2,231. 
Net profit for the year 3,932 * Total amount paid as interim dividend, at the rate of EUR 4.85 fixed cents per eligible share (recorded in 'Shareholders' equity - Interim dividends'). ** Fixed dividend of EUR 5.15 gross cents per eligible share, payable in cash as from 2 May 2022. The total amount has been estimated on the assumption that, after the implementation of the second buy-back programme announced on 24 February 2022, the number of the Bank's outstanding shares eligible for the dividend will be 16,804,353,202. ***Estimated amount corresponding to a final dividend of EUR 865 million. To be increased or reduced by the same amount by which the final dividend is lower or higher, respectively, than that amount.
The transcribed proposal comprises the part of the 2021 shareholder remuneration policy that is implemented through cash dividends (the interim dividend paid in November 2021 of EUR 4.85 cents per share with dividend entitlement and the final dividend expected to be paid as of 2 May 2022, subject to approval by the general meeting of shareholders, of EUR 5.15 cents per share with dividend entitlement).
In addition, the 2021 remuneration policy also provided for shareholder remuneration through the implementation of share buyback programs, which are not reflected in the above-transcribed proposal for the appropriation of earnings. The first of these programs, amounting to approximately EUR 841 million, was completed between October and November 2021. Subject to obtaining the appropriate regulatory approvals, a second repurchase program for approximately EUR 865 million is planned to be launched. Capital reduction resolutions are also submitted to the general shareholders' meeting to redeem the treasury shares acquired in each of the two repurchase programs, also subject to the relevant regulatory authorizations.
Finally, and although it is not part of the remuneration charged to the 2021 financial year, it should be noted that in May 2021 Banco Santander paid a dividend of EUR 2.75 cents in cash per share corresponding to the 2020 financial year against share premium, for an amount of EUR 477 million, this being the maximum amount allowed in accordance with the limit established by the recommendation of the European Central Bank of 15 December 2020. This payment was made in execution of the premium distribution resolution approved at the General Shareholders' Meeting of Banco Santander held on 27 October 2020.

Auditor's Consolidated Notes to the consolidated Contents report financial statements financial statements Appendix 5. Remuneration and other benefits paid to the Bank’s directors and senior managers. 
The following section contains qualitative and quantitative disclosures on the remuneration paid to the members of the board of directors —both executive and non-executive directors— and senior managers for 2021 and 2020: a) Remuneration of Directors i. Bylaw-stipulated emoluments The annual General Meeting held on 22 March 2013 approved an amendment to the Bylaws, whereby the remuneration of directors in their capacity as board members became an annual fixed amount determined by the annual General Meeting. This amount shall remain in effect unless the shareholders resolve to change it at a general meeting. However, the board of directors may elect to reduce the amount in any years in which it deems such action justified.
The remuneration established by the Annual General Meeting was EUR 6 million in 2021 (same amount as in 2020), with two components: (a) an annual emolument and (b) attendance fees.
In regard to 2020, as a gesture of responsibility in view of the situation created by the health emergency the board of directors agreed on 5 May 2020 to reduce their allotments by 20% for the balance of 2020, with effect from 1 April 2020, and propose that amounts saved thereby be used to finance the initiatives of the Bank to fight against the covid-19 pandemic.
The specific amount payable for the above-mentioned items to each of the directors is determined by the Board of Directors. For such purpose, it takes into consideration the positions held by each director on the Board, their membership of the Board and the board committees and their attendance to the meetings thereof, and any other objective circumstances considered by the Board.
The total bylaw-stipulated emoluments earned by the Directors in 2021 amounted to EUR 4.8 million (4.1 million in 2020).
Annual emolument In 2021, the board voted not to change the fees amount set out in the 2020 policy ahead of the aforementioned exceptional decision and, per the remuneration policy approved at the 2021 AGM. Additionally, the innovation and technology committee also began to be remunerated, and its members received EUR 25,000 and its Chair, an additional EUR 70,000. The annual amounts received individually by the directors in 2021 and 2020 based on the positions held by them on the board and their membership of the board committees were as follows: 2020 1 Jan to 1 Apr to Amount per director in euros 2021 31 Mar 31 Dec. 
Members of the board of directors 90,000 22,500 49,500. 
Members of the executive committee 170,000 42,500 93,500. 
Members of the audit committee 40,000 10,000 22,000. 
Members of the appointments committee 25,000 6,250 13,750. 
Members of the remuneration committee 25,000 6,250 13,750. 
Members of the risk supervision, regulation and compliance committee 40,000 10,000 22,000. 
Members of the responsible banking, sustainability and culture committee. 
Members of the innovation and technology committee 15,000 25,000 3,750 —

Chairman of the remuneration committee 50,000 12,500 27,500. 
Chairman of the risk supervision, regulation and compliance committee 70,000 17,500 38,500. 
Chairman of the responsible banking, sustainability and culture committee. 
Chairman of the innovation and technology committee 50,000 70,000 12,500 —
27,500 —
Lead director* 110,000 27,500 60,500. 
Non-executive vice chairmen 30,000 7,500 16,500 * Mr. Bruce Carnegie-Brown, in view of the positions held on the board and its committees, in particular as chairman of the appointments and remuneration committees and as coordinating director, and the time and dedication required to properly perform such positions, has been assigned a minimum total annual remuneration of EUR 700,000 since 2015, including the annual allowance for the items corresponding to him of those indicated above and attendance fees. However, in line with the decision taken by the board of directors to reduce his fees by 20% with effect from April 1, 2020 to 31 December, which is shared by Mr. Bruce Carnegie-Brown, the same reduction was applied to this amount. Accordingly, the amount assigned for 2020 was EUR 595,000.
Attendance fees The directors receive fees for attending board and committee meetings, excluding executive committee meetings, since no attendance fees are received for this committee.
Like the annual allotment, the board voted not to change the fees amount set out in the 2020 policy ahead of the aforementioned exceptional decision and, per the remuneration policy approved at the 2021 AGM, added attendance fees for innovation and technology committee members (which they did not receive before).

Auditor's Consolidated Notes to the consolidated Contents report financial statements financial statements Appendix. 
The fees for 2021 and 2020 are as follows: 2020.

Other committees (excluding executive committee) 1,500 1,500 1,200 ii. Salaries The executive directors receive salaries. In accordance with the policy approved by the annual general meeting, salaries are composed of a fixed annual remuneration and a variable one, which consists in a unique incentive, which is a deferred variable remuneration plan linked to multi-year objectives, which establishes the following payment scheme: • 40% of the variable remuneration amount, determined at yearend on the basis of the achievement of the established objectives, is paid immediately.
• The remaining 60% is deferred over five years, to be paid in five portions, provided that the conditions of permanence in the Group and non-concurrence of the malus clauses are met, and subject to long term metrics, taking into account the following accrual scheme: – The accrual of the first and second portion (payment in 2023 and 2024) will be conditional on none of the malus clauses being triggered.
– The accrual of the third, fourth, and fifth portion (payment in 2025, 2026 and 2027), is linked to objectives related to the period 2021—2023 and the metrics and scales associated with these objectives. The fulfilment of the objectives determines the percentage to be paid of the deferred amount in these three annuities, which, accordingly, might not be paid, where the maximum amount is the amount determined at closing of 2021, when the total variable remuneration is approved.
• In accordance with current remuneration policies, the amounts already paid will be subject to a possible recovery (clawback) by the Bank during the period set out in the policy in force at each moment.
The immediate payment (or short-term), as well as each deferred payment (linked to long term metrics and not linked to long-term metrics) will be settled 50% in cash and the remaining 50% in Santander shares.
In the case of Sergio Rial, he has been considered as an executive director since his appointment as director became effective on 30 May 2020 by virtue of Article 529 duodecies of the Spanish Companies Act in light of his role as CEO and vice-chairman of Banco Santander Brasil, S.A. In 2021 he received as fixed pay for his role as Regional head for South America, the EUR 750,000 euros that had been approved at the 2021 AGM as part of the 2021 remuneration policy. He has not received any other remuneration for executive functions in Banco Santander, S.A.
The same policy and principles above apply to Sergio Rial's remuneration as CEO in Santander Brasil.
Comparative of Executive Remuneration (Chairman and CEO) The board resolved to maintain the same gross annual salary for Ana Botín and José Antonio Álvarez for 2021 as in 2020. It also maintained the fixed pension contribution of 22% of gross annual salary it had declared in 2020 for 2021.
Comparing with the previous year, it should be mentioned that amid the covid-19 health crisis in 2020, Ana Botín and José Antonio Álvarez proposed to reduce their total 2020 compensation (salary and bonus) by 50%.
To achieve the 50% reduction compared to 2019, the board of directors decided to apply an additional adjustment to Ana Botín’s and José Antonio Alvarez’s variable compensation, reducing the variable compensation by 74% in the case of Ana Botín and 79% in the case of José Antonio Álvarez.
And in 2021, the good business performance (which enabled Banco Santander to reach a 12.73% underlying RoTE, above the end of 2019), the excellent execution of our strategy (with the highest underlying attributable profit of the last 12 years), and the efficient capital management, boosted the bonus pool and thus the variable remuneration of corporate centre employees, (including executive directors).
iii. Detail by director The detail, by bank director, of the short-term (immediate) and deferred (not subject to long-term goals) remuneration for 2021 and 2020 is provided below:

Following is the detail, by executive director, of the salaries linked to multi-year objectives at their fair value, which will only be received if the conditions of permanence in the group, non-applicability of malus clauses and achievement of the established objectives are met (or, as the case may be, of the minimum thresholds thereof, with the consequent reduction of amount agreed-upon at the end of the year) in the terms described in Note 46.

The fair value has been determined at the grant date based on the valuation report of an independent expert, Willis Towers Watson. Based on the design of the plan for 2021 and the levels of achievement of similar plans in comparable entities, the expert concludes that the reasonable range for estimating the initial achievement ratio is around 60% - 80%. Accordingly, it has been considered that the fair value is 70% of the maximum (see note 46).
Note 5.e below includes disclosures on the shares delivered from the deferred remuneration schemes in place in previous years and for which delivery conditions were met, as well as on the maximum number of shares that may be received in future years in connection with the aforementioned 2021 and 2020 variable remuneration plans.
In addition to the EUR 750,000 Sergio Rial received as Regional head for South America, he was paid the following amounts as CEO of Santander Brasil (additionally, in the following table, it is also disclosed the variable subject to long-term objectives at 70% of fair value): 2021 BRL thousand EUR thousand.

Sergio Rial 791 791 1,582 1,311 b) Remuneration of the Board members as representatives of the Bank By resolution of the executive committee, all the remuneration received by the Bank’s directors who represent the Bank on the Boards of Directors of listed companies in which the Bank has a stake, paid by those companies and relating to appointments made on or after 18 March, 2002, accrues to the Group. In 2021 and 2020 the Bank’s directors did not receive any remuneration in respect of these representative duties.
On the other hand, in their personal capacity, in 2021 Álvaro Cardoso was paid BRL 2,130 thousand (EUR 334 thousand) as non-executive chairman of Banco Santander Brasil, S.A., Homaira Akbari was paid USD 190 thousand (EUR 161 thousand) as member of the board of Santander Consumer USA (SCUSA) and EUR 52 thousand as member of the Board of PagoNxt, and Henrique de Castro and R. Martín Chávez were each paid the same EUR 52 thousand as members of the board of PagoNxt. Likewise, Pamela Walkden was paid GBP 31 thousand (EUR 36 thousand) as member of Santander UK plc y Santander UK Group Holdings.
Likewise, Luis Isasi was paid EUR 1,000 thousand as non-executive chairman of the board of Santander Spain and for attending board and committee meetings (amounts paid by Banco Santander, S.A.).
c) Post-employment and other long-term benefits In 2012, the contracts of Ms. Ana Botín and Mr. José Antonio Alvarez (and other members of the Bank's senior management) with defined benefit pension commitments were modified to transform these commitments into a defined contribution system, which covers the contingencies of retirement, disability and death. From that moment on, the Bank makes annual contributions to their pension system for their benefit.
This system gives them the right to receive benefits upon retirement, regardless of whether or not they are active at the Bank at such time, based on contributions to the system, and replaced their previous right to receive a pension supplement in the event of retirement.
Upon revision in 2021, José Antonio Álvarez’s contract precluded the right to early retirement if terminated. Furthermore, Ana Botín is not entitled to early retirement if she freely resigns; however, she will still be entitled to it if Banco Santander terminates her contract before 31 August 2022, at which time early retirement will no longer be available. As long as she retains that right, she is entitled to an annual allotment equal to her total fixed remuneration, plus 30% of the average of up to her last three variable pays.
The initial balance for each of them in the new defined benefits system corresponded to the market value of the assets from which the provisions corresponding to the respective accrued obligations had materialised on the date on which the old pension commitments were transferred into the new benefits system.
Since 2013, the Bank has made annual contributions to the benefits system for executive directors and senior executives, in proportion to their respective pensionable bases, until they leave Grupo Santander or until their retirement within the Group, death, or disability.
The benefit plan system is outsourced to Santander Seguros y Reaseguros, Compañía Aseguradora, S.A., and the economic rights of the foregoing directors under this plan belong to them regardless of whether or not they are active at the Bank at the time of their retirement, death or disability.

Auditor's Consolidated Notes to the consolidated Contents report financial statements financial statements Appendix. 
In accordance with the provisions of the remuneration regulations, contributions made calculated on variable remuneration are subject to the discretionary pension benefits regime. Under this regime, contributions are subject to malus clauses and clawback according to the policy in force at any given time and during the same period in which the variable remuneration is deferred.
Furthermore, they must be invested in bank shares for a period of five years from the date when the executive director leaves the Group, regardless of whether or not they leave to retire. Once that period has elapsed, the amount invested in shares will be reinvested, along with the remainder of the cumulative balance corresponding to the executive director, or it will be paid to the executive director or to their beneficiaries in the event of a contingency covered by the benefits system.
As per the director´s remuneration policy approved at the 23 March 2018 general shareholder´s meeting, the system was changed with a focus on: • Aligning the annual contributions with practices of comparable institutions.
• Reducing future liabilities by eliminating the supplementary benefits scheme in the event of death (death of spouse or parent) and permanent disability of serving directors.
• Not increasing total costs for the Bank.
The changes to the system were the following: • Fixed and variable pension contributions were reduced to 22% of the respective pensionable bases. The gross annual salaries and the benchmark variable remuneration were increased in the corresponding amount with no increase in total costs for the Bank. The pensionable base for the purposes of the annual contributions for the executive directors is the sum of fixed remuneration plus 30% of the average of their last three variable remuneration amounts.
• The death and disability supplementary benefits were eliminated since 1 April 2018. A fixed remuneration supplement (included in other remuneration in section a.iii in this note) was implemented the same date.
• The total amount insured for life and accident insurance was increased.
The provisions recognised in 2021 and 2020 for retirement pensions and supplementary benefits (surviving spouse and child benefits, and permanent disability) were as follows:
EUR thousand 2021 2020. 
Ana Botín 1,041 1,155. 
José Antonio Álvarez 783 864. 
Total 1,825 2,019. 
Following is a detail of the balances relating to each of the executive directors under the welfare system as of 31 December 2021 and 2020:
EUR thousand 2021 2020. 
Ana Botín 48,075 49,444. 
José Antonio Álvarez 18,821 18,082. 
Total 66,896 67,526 d) Insurance The Group pays for life insurance policies for the Bank’s directors, who will be entitled to receive benefits if they are declared disabled; in the event of death, the benefits will be payable to their heirs. The premiums paid by the Group are included in the 'Other remuneration' column of the table shown in Note 5.a.iii above. Also, the following table provides information on the sums insured for the Bank’s executive directors:
Insured capital. 
EUR thousand 2021 2020. 
Ana Botín 21,489 21,984. 
José Antonio Álvarez 18,028 18,703. 
Total 39,517 40,687. 
The insured capital has been modified in 2018 for Ms Ana Botín and Mr José Antonio Alvarez as part of the pension systems transformation set out in note 5.c) above, which has encompassed the elimination of the supplementary benefits systems (death of spouse and death of parent) and the increase of the life insurance annuities.
During 2021 and 2020, the Group has disbursed a total amount of EUR 25.5 million and EUR 19.5 million , respectively, for the payment of civil-liability insurance premiums. These premiums correspond to several civil-liability insurance policies that hedge, among others, directors, senior executives and other managers and employees of the Group and the Bank itself, as well as its subsidiaries, in light of certain types of potential claims. For this reason, it is not possible to disaggregate or individualize the amount that correspond to the directors and executives.
As of 31 December 2021 and 2020, no life insurance commitments exist for the Group in respect of any other directors.
e) Deferred variable remuneration systems The following information relates to the maximum number of shares to which the executive directors are entitled at the beginning and end of 2021 and 2020 due to their participation in the deferred variable remuneration systems, which instrumented a portion of their variable remuneration relating to 2021 and prior years, as well as on the deliveries, in shares or in cash, made to them in 2021 and 2020 once the conditions for the receipt thereof had been met (see Note 46): i) Deferred conditional variable remuneration plan From 2011 to 2015, the bonuses of executive directors and certain executives (including senior management) and employees who assume risk, who perform control functions or receive an overall remuneration that puts them on the same remuneration level as senior executives and employees who assume risk (all of whom are.

Auditor's Consolidated Notes to the consolidated Contents report financial statements financial statements Appendix referred to as identified staff) have been approved by the Board of Directors and instrumented, respectively, through various cycles of the deferred conditional variable remuneration plan. Application of these cycles, insofar as they entail the delivery of shares to the plan beneficiaries, was authorized by the related Annual General Meetings.
The purpose of these plans was to defer a portion of the bonus of the plan beneficiaries (60% in the case of executive directors) over a period of five years (three years for the plans approved up to 2014) for it to be paid, where appropriate, in cash and in Santander shares. The remaining 40% portion of the bonus is paid in cash and Santander shares (in equal parts), upon commencement of this plan, in accordance with the rules set forth below.
In addition to the requirement that the beneficiary remains in Santander Group’s employ, the accrual of the deferred remuneration was conditional upon none of the following circumstances existing in the opinion of the Board of Directors -following a proposal of the remuneration committee-, in relation to the corresponding year, in the period prior to each of the deliveries: (i) poor financial performance of the Group; (ii) breach by the beneficiary of internal regulations, including, in particular, those relating to risks; (iii) material restatement of the Group’s consolidated financial statements, except when it is required pursuant to a change in accounting standards; or (iv) significant changes in the Group’s economic capital or its risk profile. All the foregoing shall be subject in each case to the regulations of the relevant plan cycle.
Deferred amounts (whether or not contingent on multi-year targets) is earned if the beneficiary continues to work with the group14, and none of the circumstances triggering the malus clause arise before each payment, according to the section on malus and clawback clauses in the remuneration policy.
Similarly, Banco Santander can clawback any paid variable amounts in the scenarios and for the period dictated by the terms and conditions in the said policy.
On each delivery, the beneficiaries are paid an amount in cash equal to the dividends paid for the amount deferred in shares and the interest on the amount deferred in cash. If the Santander Dividendo Elección scrip dividend scheme is applied, payment will be based on the price offered by the Bank for the bonus share rights corresponding to those shares.
The maximum number of shares to be delivered is calculated taking into account the daily volume-weighted average prices for the 15 trading sessions prior to the date on which the board of directors approves the bonus for the Bank’s Executive Directors for each year.
This plan and the Performance Shares (ILP) plan described below have been integrated for the executive directors and other senior managers in the deferred variable compensation plan linked to multiannual objectives, in the terms approved by the General Meeting of Shareholders held on March 18, 2016.
In the case of Sergio Rial, who does not receive any remuneration for executive duties in Banco Santander, S.A., the same policy principles, deferrals, multi year targets linked to the payment of deferred amounts and malus and clawback principles described herein apply to his variable remuneration in the subsidiary where he is the CEO.
ii) Deferred variable compensation plan linked to multiannual objectives In the annual shareholders meeting of 18 March 2016, with the aim of simplifying the remuneration structure, improving the ex-ante risk adjustment and increasing the incidence of long-term objectives, the bonus plan (deferred and conditioned variable compensation plan) and ILP were replaced by one single plan, the deferred multiyear objectives variable remuneration plan.
The variable remuneration of executive directors and certain executives (including senior management) corresponding to 2021 has been approved by the Board of Directors and implemented through the sixth cycle of the deferred variable remuneration plan linked to multi-year objectives. The application of the plan was authorised by the annual general meeting of shareholders, as it entails the delivery of shares to the beneficiaries.
As indicated in section a.ii of this note, 60% of the variable remuneration amount is deferred over five years (three years for certain beneficiaries, not including executive directors), to be paid, where appropriate, in five portions, provided that the conditions of permanence in the group and non-concurrence of malus clauses are met, and subject to long term metrics, according to the following accrual scheme: • The accrual of the first and second parts (instalments in 2023 and 2024) is conditional on none of the malus clauses being triggered.
• The accrual of the third, fourth and fifth parts (instalments in 2025, 2026 and 2027) is linked to the fulfilment of certain objectives related to the 2021‑2023 period and the metrics and scales associated with those objectives, as well as to nonconcurrence of malus clauses. These objectives are: – The growth of consolidated earnings per share in 2023 compared to 2020; – The relative performance of the Bank’s total shareholder return (RTA) in the 2021-2023 period in relation to the weighted RTAs of a reference group of 9 credit institutions; – Compliance with the fully loaded ordinary level 1 capital objective for the year 2023.
The degree of compliance with the above objectives determines the percentage to be applied to the deferred amount in these three annuities, the maximum being the amount determined at the end of the year 2021 when the total variable remuneration is approved.
Both the immediate (short-term) and each of the deferred (longterm and conditioned) portions are paid 50% in cash and the remaining 50% in Santander shares.
The accrual of deferred amounts (whether or not subject to performance measures) is conditioned, in addition to the permanence of the beneficiary in the Group, to non-occurrence, during the period prior to each of the deliveries, of any the circumstances giving rise to the application of malus as set out in the Group’s remuneration policy in its chapter related to malus and clawback. Likewise, the amounts already paid of the incentive will be subject to clawback by the Bank in the cases and during the term foreseen in said policy, and in accordance with the terms and conditions foreseen in it.

Auditor's Consolidated Contents report financial statements. 
Malus and clawback clauses are triggered by poor financial performance of Banco Santander, a division or area, or exposures from staff as a result of an executive(s)’s management of, at least, one of these factors: (i) Significant failures in risk management committed by the entity, or by a business unit or risk control.
(ii) The increase suffered by the entity or by a business unit of its capital needs, not foreseen at the time of generation of the exposures.
(iii) Regulatory sanctions or judicial sentences from events that could be attributable to the unit or the personnel responsible for those. Also, the breach of internal codes of conduct of the entity.
(iv) Irregular conduct, whether individual or collective. In this regard, the negative effects derived from the marketing of inappropriate products and the responsibilities of the people or bodies that made those decisions will be specially considered.
The maximum number of shares to be delivered is calculated by taking into account the average weighted daily volume of the average weighted listing prices corresponding to the fifteen trading sessions prior to the previous Friday (excluded) to the date on which the bonus is agreed by the board of executive directors of the Bank.
In the case of Mr. Sergio Rial, as explained above, he just received a fixed pay for executive duties in Banco Santander, S.A. (head for South America), and he is included as CEO of Santander Brasil in the deferred variable compensation plan linked to multiannual objectives and thus subject to the same conditions and principles of deferral, multiannual objectives, deferrals and malus and clawback herein in respect of the remuneration he receives in his role as CEO of this subsidiary.
iii) Shares assigned by deferred variable remuneration plans The following table shows the number of Santander shares assigned to each executive director and pending delivery as of 1 January 2020, 31 December 2020 and 31 December 2021, as well as the gross shares that were delivered to them in 2020 and 2021, either in the form of an immediate payment or a deferred payment. In this case after having been appraised by the board, at the proposal of the remuneration committee, that the corresponding one-fifth of each plan had accrued. They come from each of the plans through which the variable remunerations of deferred conditional variable remuneration plans in 2015 and of the deferred conditional and linked to multi-year objectives in 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021 were formalized.

At the annual general meeting on 26 March 2021, shareholders approved the 2021 Digital Transformation Incentive, a variable remuneration scheme that delivers Santander shares and share options if the group hits major milestones on its digital roadmap.
In 2021, no senior executives are included in this programme. However, in 2020, three senior executives were included within this plan (aimed at a group of up to 250 employees whose functions are deemed essential to Santander Group’s growth and digital transformation) and, thus, can receive a total of EUR 1,700 thousand to be paid in thirds on the third, fourth and fifth anniversary of the authorisation date (2024, 2025 and 2026). This amount was implemented in 316,574 Santander shares and 944,445 options over Santander shares, using for these purposes the fair value of the options at the moment of their grant (EUR 0.90).
See note 46 to the 2021 Group's consolidated financial statements for further information on the Digital Transformation Incentive.
In 2021, the ratio of variable to fixed pay components was 125% of the total for senior managers, well within the maximum limit of 200% set by 2021 AGM.

Also, the detail of the breakdown of the remuneration linked to longterm objectives of the members of senior management at 31 December 2021 and 31 December 2020 is provided below. These remuneration payments shall be received, as the case may be, in the corresponding deferral periods, upon achievement of the conditions stipulated for each payment (see note 46):

Senior executive vice presidents who retired in 2021 and, therefore, were not members of senior management at year-end, received in 2021 salaries and other remuneration amounting to EUR 5,294 thousand (EUR 5,984 thousand in 2020). Likewise, these same individuals have generated as senior managers the right to obtain variable remuneration linked to long-term objectives for a total amount of EUR 55 thousand (this right has been generated in 2020 for a total amount of EUR 133 thousand).
The maximum number of Santander shares that the members of senior management at each plan grant date (excluding executive directors) were entitled to receive as of 31 December 2021 and 31 December 2020 relating to the deferred portion under the various plans then in force is the following (see note 46):

As indicated in note 5.c above, senior management participate in the benefit system created in 2012, which covers the contingencies of retirement, disability and death. Banco Santander makes annual contributions to the benefit plans of its senior managers. In 2012, the contracts of the senior managers with benefit pension commitments were amended to transform them into a contribution system. The system, which is outsourced to Santander Seguros y Reaseguros, Compañía Aseguradora, S.A., gives senior managers the right to receive benefits upon retirement, regardless of whether or not they are active at Banco Santander at such time, based on contributions to the system. This new system replaced their previous right to receive a pension supplement in the event of retirement. In the event of preretirement, and up to the retirement date, senior managers appointed prior to September 2015 are entitled to receive an annual allowance.
In addition, further to applicable remuneration regulations, from 2016 (inclusive), a discretionary pension benefit component of at least 15% of total remuneration in contributions to the pension system has been included. Under the regime corresponding to these discretionary benefits, the contributions that are calculated on variable remunerations are subject to malus and clawback clauses, subject to policies applicable at each time, and during the same period in which the variable remuneration is deferred.
Likewise, the annual contributions calculated on variable remunerations must be invested in Bank shares for a period of five years from the date that the senior manager leaves the Group, regardless of whether or not they leave to retire. Once that period has elapsed, the amount invested in shares will be reinvested, along with the remainder of the cumulative balance corresponding to the senior manager, or it will be paid to the senior manager or to their beneficiaries in the event of a contingency covered by the benefits system.

Auditor's Consolidated Notes to the consolidated Contents report financial statements financial statements Appendix. 
The contracts of some senior executives were modified at the beginning of 2018 with the same objective and changes indicated in section c of this note for Ms Ana Botín and Mr José Antonio Álvarez. The modifications, which are aimed at aligning the annual contributions with the practices of comparable institutions and reducing the risk of future obligations by eliminating the supplementary scheme for death (widowhood and orphanhood) and permanent disability in service without increasing the costs to the bank, are as follows: • Contributions to the pensionable bases were reduced. Gross annual salaries were increased in the corresponding amount.
• The death and disability supplementary benefits were eliminated since January 1, 2018. A fixed remuneration supplement reflected in other remuneration in the table above was implemented on the same date.
• The amounts insured for life and accident insurance were increased.
All of the above was done without an increase in total cost for the Bank.
The balance as of 31 December 2021 in the pension system for those who were part of senior management during the year amounted to EUR 64.3 million (EUR 59.4 million at 31 December 2020).
The net charge to income corresponding to pension and supplementary benefits for widows, orphans and permanent invalidity amounted to EUR 5.5 million in 2021 (EUR 6.4 million in 31 December 2020).
In 2021 and 2020 there have been no payments in the form of a single payment of the annual voluntary pre-retirement allowance.
Additionally, the capital insured by life and accident insurance at 31 December 2020 of this group amounts to EUR 100 million (EUR 135.1 million at 31 December 2020).
h) Post-employment benefits to former Directors and former senior executive vice presidents The post-employment benefits and settlements paid in 2021 to former directors of the Bank, other than those detailed in note 5.c amounted to EUR 5.6 million and EUR 11.2 million in 2020, respectively. Also, the post-employment benefits and settlements paid in 2021 to former executive vice presidents amounted to EUR 51.6 million and EUR 10.26 million in 2020, respectively.
Contributions to insurance policies that hedge pensions and complementary widowhood, orphanhood and permanent disability benefits to previous members of the Bank’s board of directors, amounted to EUR 0.17 million in 2021 (EUR 0.17 million in 2020). Likewise, contributions to insurance policies that hedge pensions and complementary widowhood, orphanhood and permanent disability benefits for previous senior managers amounted to EUR 4.4 million in 2021 (EUR 5.8 million in 2020).
During the 2021 financial year, no release or charge was recorded in the consolidated income statement for pension commitments and similar obligations held by the Group with previous former members of the bank's board of directors (in 2020, five million releases were recorded), and no provisions/releases has been recorded in respect of former senior managers in 2021 and 2020.
In addition, 'Provisions - Pension Fund and similar obligations' in the consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 2021 included EUR 50 million in respect of the post-employment benefit obligations to former Directors of the Bank (EUR 52 million at 31 December 2020) and EUR 114 million corresponding to former senior managers (EUR 159 million at 31 December 2020).
i) Pre-retirement and retirement The board of directors approved an amendment to the contracts of the executive directors whereby: • Ms Ana Botín ceases to have the right to pre-retire if she leaves the Bank out of her own volition, keeping this right in case of termination by the Bank until 1 September 2022. After this date, she does not have the right to pre-retire. While she keeps this right she will be entitled to an annual allotment equal to the sum of her fixed remuneration and 30% of the average amount of her last variable remuneration, to a maximum of three. This allotment is subject to the malus and clawback provisions in place for a period of five years.
• Mr. José Antonio Álvarez ceases to have the right to pre-retire in case of termination of his contract.
j) Contract termination The executive directors and senior managers have indefinite-term employment contracts. Executive directors or senior managers whose contracts are terminated voluntarily or due to breach of duties are not entitled to receive any economic compensation. If Banco Santander terminates the contract for any other reason, they will be entitled to the corresponding legally-stipulated termination benefit, without prejudice to any compensation that may for noncompetition obligations, as detailed in the directors' remuneration policy.
If Banco Santander were to terminate her contract, Ms. Ana BotínSanz de Sautuola y O'Shea would have to remain at Banco Santander’s disposal for a period of 4 months in order to ensure an adequate transition, and would receive her fixed salary during that period.
k) Information on investments held by the directors in other companies and conflicts of interest None of the members of the board of directors have declared that they or persons related to them may have a direct or indirect conflict of interest with the interests of Banco Santander, S.A., as set forth in Article 229 of the Corporate Enterprises Act.

In the last quarter of 2019, debt securities were transferred from the 'Financial asset at amortised cost' to the 'Financial asset at fair value through other comprehensive income'. The fair value of these assets at the date of the transfer being EUR 6,359 million.
As established in IFRS 9, the aforementioned transfer was made prospectively, recognising the difference between the previous amortised cost of the transferred financial assets and their fair value in 'Other comprehensive income'. In application of this standard, the effective interest rate and the measurement of expected credit losses were not adjusted as a result of the reclassification.
The context of adapting the Group´s commercial strategy to the changes in business models, in order to favour a greater alignment of the sensitivity of the Bank's balance sheet masses to interest rates, has led to a change in the assets related to these liabilities from a business model whose objective is to collect the principal and interest flows to a business model whose objective is achieved through the collection of the principal and interest flows and the sale of these assets.
At 31 December 2021, 2020 and 2019 the exposure by impairment stage of the book assets under IFRS 9 amounted to EUR 133,437 million, EUR 134,792 million and EUR 147,575 million in stage 1; EUR 128 million, EUR 72 million and EUR 446 million in stage 2, and EUR 280 million, EUR 401 million and EUR 647 million in stage 3, respectively.

This amount, after deducting the related allowances, represents the Group’s best estimate of the discounted value of the flows that are expected to be recovered from the impaired assets.
At 31 December 2021, the Group’s written-off assets totalled EUR 40,585 million (EUR 39,087 million and EUR 46,209 million at 31 December 2020 and 2019, respectively).
Set forth below for each class of impaired asset are the gross amount, associated allowances and information relating to the collateral and/or other credit enhancements obtained at 31 December 2021:
EUR million. 
Estimated Gross Allowance collateral amount recognised value*
Without associated real collateral 13,327 7,416 —
With real estate collateral 12,907 3,540 9,054. 
With other collateral 5,411 2,594 2,317. 
Total 31,645 13,550 11,371 * Including the estimated value of the collateral associated with each loan. Accordingly, any other cash flows that may be obtained, such as those arising from borrowers’ personal guarantees, are not included.
When classifying assets in the previous table, the main factors considered by the Group to determine whether an asset has become impaired are the existence of amounts past due —assets impaired due to arrears— or other circumstances may be arise which will not result in all contractual cash flow being recovered, such as a deterioration of the borrower’s financial situation, the worsening of its capacity to generate funds or difficulties experienced by it in accessing credit.
e) Transferred credits 'Loans and advances to customers' includes, inter alia, the securitised loans transferred to third parties on which the Group has retained the risks and rewards, albeit partially, and which therefore, in accordance with the applicable accounting standards, cannot be derecognised. This is mainly due to mortgage loans, loans to companies and consumer loans in which the group retains subordinate financing and/or grants some kind of credit enhancement to new holders.
Securitisation is used as a tool for the management of regulatory capital and as a means of diversifying the Group's liquidity sources.
The breakdown of securitized loans held on the balance sheet, according to the nature of the financial instrument in which they are originated, is shown below:
EUR million 2021 2020 2019. 
Retained on the balance sheet 80,600 88,662 93,553.

At 31 December 2021, Grupo Santander had loans that had been fully derecognised and for which it retained servicing amounting to EUR 14,141 million (EUR 13,999 million and EUR 16,786 million at 31 December 2020 and 2019, respectively).

The carrying amount at 31 December 2021 in the foregoing table includes the following approximate amounts EUR 6,753 million (EUR 6,299 million at 31 December 2020 and EUR 7,737 million at 31 December 2019) relating to property, plant and equipment owned by group entities and branches located abroad.
c) Tangible assets - Leased out under an operating lease. 
Grupo Santander has assets leased out under operating leases where the company is the lessor and do not meet the accounting requirements to be classified as finance leases. The net cost of these leases is recorded as an asset and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the contractual term of the lease to the expected residual value.
The expected residual value and, consequently, the monthly depreciation expense may change during the term of the lease. The Group estimates expected residual values using independent data sources and internal statistical models. It also assesses the estimate of the residual value of these leases and adjusts the depreciation rate in line with the change in the expected value of the asset at the end of the lease.
Grupo Santander periodically assesses its investment in operating leases for impairment in certain circumstances, such as a systemic and material decrease in the values of used vehicles. If assets leased out under operating leases are deemed to be impaired, impairment is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value as estimated by discounted cash flows.
Of the EUR 19,083 million that the Group had assigned to operating leases at 31 December 2021 (EUR 18,559 million and EUR 19,221 million at 31 December 2020 and 2019, respectively), EUR 12,977 million (EUR 13,455 million and EUR 14,799 million at 31 December 2020 and 2019, respectively ) relate to vehicles of Santander Consumer USA Holdings Inc. The variable lease payments of various items of this entity are not representative.
In addition, the maturity analysis of the payments for assets leased out under operating leases from Santander Consumer USA Holdings Inc. is as follows:
EUR million 2021.

Auditor's Consolidated Notes to the consolidated Contents report financial statements financial statements Appendix d) Tangible assets - Investment property The fair value of investment property at 31 December 2021, 2020, 2019 amounted to EUR 1,088, 1,055 and 1,076 million, respectively. A comparison of the fair value of investment property at 31 December 2021, 2020 and 2019 with the net book value shows gross unrealised gains of EUR 109, 92 and 103 million, respectively, attributed completely to the group.
The rental income earned from investment property and the direct costs related both to investment properties that generated rental income in 2021, 2020 and 2019 and to investment properties that did not generate rental income in those years are not material in the context of the consolidated financial statements.

Exchange differences and other items 167 (2,104) 230. 
Balance at end of year 12,713 12,471 24,246. 
Grupo Santander has goodwill generated by cash-generating units located in non-euro currency countries (mainly Brazil, Poland, the United States, the United Kingdom, Chile, Mexico, Norway and Sweden) and, therefore, this gives rise to exchange differences on the translation to euros, at closing rates, of the amounts of goodwill denominated in foreign currencies. Accordingly, in 2021 there was an increase of EUR 167 million (a decrease of EUR 2,104 million in 2020 and an increase of EUR 230 million in 2019), due to exchange differences and other items which, pursuant to current standards, were recognised with a change to 'Other comprehensive income Items that may be reclassified to profit or loss - Exchange differences in other comprehensive income in the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense' (see note 29.d).
At least once per year (or whenever there is any indication of impairment), Grupo Santander performs an analysis of the potential impairment of its recorded goodwill with respect to its recoverable amount. The first step that must be taken in order to perform this analysis is the identification of the cash-generating units, which are the Group's smallest identifiable groups of assets that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets or groups of assets.
The amount to be recovered of each cash-generating unit is determined taking into consideration the carrying amount (including any fair value adjustment arising on the business combination) of all the assets and liabilities of all the independent legal entities composing the cash-generating unit, together with the related goodwill.
The amount to be recovered of the cash-generating unit is compared with its recoverable amount in order to determine whether there is any impairment.
Grupo Santander's directors assess the existence of any indication that might be considered to be evidence of impairment of the cashgenerating unit by reviewing information including the following (i) certain macroeconomic variables that might affect its investments (population data, political situation, economic situation —including banking concentration level—, among others) and (ii) various microeconomic variables comparing the investments of the Group with the financial services industry of the country in which the cashgenerating unit carries on most of its business activities (balance sheet composition, total funds under management, results, efficiency ratio, capital adequacy ratio, return on equity, among others).
Regardless of whether there is any indication of impairment, every year the Group calculates the recoverable amount of each cash-generating unit to which goodwill, has been allocated and, to this end, it uses price quotations, market references (multiples), internal estimates and valuations performed by internal and external experts.
Firstly, the Group determines the recoverable amount by calculating the fair value of each cash-generating unit on the basis of the quoted price of the cash-generating units, if available.

Auditor's Consolidated Notes to the consolidated Contents report financial statements financial statements Appendix. 
In addition, the Group performs estimates of the recoverable amounts of certain cash-generating units by calculating their value in use using discounted cash flow projections. The main assumptions used in this calculation are (i) earnings projections based on the financial budgets approved by the Group’s directors which cover between three and five year periods (unless a longer time horizon can be justified), (ii) discount rates determined as the cost of capital taking into account the risk-free rate of return plus a risk premium in line with the market and the business in which the units operate and (iii) constant growth rates used in order to extrapolate earnings in perpetuity which do not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the market in which the cash-generating unit in question operates.
The cash flow projections used by Group management to obtain the values in use are based on the financial budgets approved by both local management of the related local units and the Group’s directors. The Group’s budgetary estimation process is common for all the cash-generating units. The local management teams prepare their budgets using the following key assumptions: a) Microeconomic variables of the cash-generating unit: management takes into consideration the current balance sheet structure, the product mix and the business decisions taken by local management in this regard.
b) Macroeconomic variables: growth is estimated on the basis of the changing environment, taking into consideration expected GDP growth in the unit’s geographical location and forecast trends in interest and exchange rates. These data, which are based on external information sources, are provided by the Group’s economic research service.
c) Past performance variables: in addition, management takes into consideration in the projection the difference (both positive and negative) between the cash-generating unit’s past performance and budgets.
During 2021, the Group recognised impairment losses of EUR 6 million of immaterial goodwill which were recognised under 'Impairment or reversal of impairment of non-financial assets, net - Intangible assets'. Goodwill is deducted from CET1 for regulatory purposes and therefore an impairment of goodwill has no impact on the Group's capital ratios.
In 2020, considering the economic and business environment resulting from covid-19, market conditions and the existing economic uncertainty, an impairment test was performed for certain CGUs during the second quarter. As a result, the Group recognised goodwill impairment of EUR 10,100 million, mainly associated with Santander UK, Santander Bank Polska, Santander Bank, National Association, Santander Consumer USA and Santander Consumer Nordics.
In 2019, the Group recorded an impairment of goodwill associated with Santander UK amounting to EUR 1,491 million considering the following reasons: decrease in the profit generation capacity of the cash generating unit in contrast to the forecast made in previous years, the general competitive environment in the UK, the impact of the banking reform on retail businesses and the impact of the uncertainty generated by Brexit on the country's economic growth.

Following is a detail of the main assumptions taken into account in determining the recoverable amount, at 2021 year-end, of the most significant cash-generating units which were valued using the discounted cash flow method: 2021. 
Nominal. 
Projected period Discount rate* perpetual growth rate. 
Santander UK 5 years 9.2% 2.3%
Santander Bank Polska 5 years 10.3% 3.5%
Santander Consumer USA 3 years 10.6% 1.5%
Santander Bank, National Association** 5 years 11.6% 3.0%
Santander Consumer Germany 5 years 8.3% 1.8% SAM Investment Holdings, Limited 5 years 10.4% 2.5%
Santander Portugal 5 years 9.7% 1.8%
Santander Consumer Nordics 5 years 9.9% 2.0% * Post-tax discount rate. ** Weighted information of the main assumptions of the segments to which goodwill has been allocated.
The discount and nominal perpetual growth rates taken into account in 2020 and 2019 are presented below for comparison purposes:
Nominal. 
Discount rate* perpetual growth rate 2020 2019 2020 2019. 
Santander UK 9.5% 8.5% 2.3% 2.5%
Santander Bank Polska 10.0% 9.2% 3.5% 3.5%
Santander Consumer USA 10.7% 9.5% 1.5% 1.5%
Santander Bank, National Association** 11.6% 9.6% 2.5% 3.6%
Santander Consumer Germany 9.0% 8.2% 1.8% 2.5%
SAM Investment Holdings, Limited 10.1% 10.0% 2.5% 2.5%
Santander Portugal 9.8% 8.9% 1.8% 2.0%
Santander Consumer Nordics 10.1% 8.6% 2.0% 2.5% * Post-tax discount rate. ** Weighted information of the main assumptions of the segments to which goodwill has been allocated.
Given the degree of uncertainty of the above key assumptions on which the recoverable amount of the cash-generating units is based, the Group performs a sensitivity analysis which consisted of adjusting +/- 50 basis points the discount rate, adjusting +/- 50 basis points the growth rate in perpetuity and reducing the cash flow projections by 5%. These changes in the key assumptions in isolation mean that the recoverable amount of all the cash-generating units continues to exceed their amount to be recovered and have been considered by the Group to be reasonably possible in a stable economic environment and in which non-recurring events unrelated to the business operations of the cash-generating units are not contemplated.
The recoverable amount of Banco Santander - Chile, Grupo Financiero Santander (México) and Banco Santander (Brasil) was calculated as the fair values of the aforementioned cash-generating units obtained from the quoted market prices of their shares at yearend. This value exceeded the amount to be recovered. A significant reduction in the quoted market prices of these cash generating unit could result in an indication of impairment which in turn may lead to a goodwill impairment charge in the future.

d) Guarantees Set forth below is information on the liabilities secured by assets:
EUR million 2021 2020 2019. 
Asset-backed securities 40,519 35,753 38,616. 
Of which, mortgage-backed securities 1,487 2,274 3,819. 
Other mortgage securities 41,779 49,425 50,269. 
Of which: mortgage-backed bonds 23,197 24,736 24,736. 
Territorial covered bond 630 869 1,270 82,928 86,047 90,155. 
The main characteristics of the assets securing the aforementioned financial liabilities are as follows: 1. Asset-backed securities a. Mortgage-backed securities- these securities are secured by mortgage assets (see Note 10.e) with average maturities of more than ten years that must: be a first mortgage for acquisition of principal or second residence, be current in payments, have a loan-to-value ratio below 80% and have a liability insurance policy in force covering at least the appraisal value. The value of the financial liabilities broken down in the foregoing table is lower than the balance of the assets securing them —securitised assets retained on the balance sheet— mainly because the Group repurchases a portion of the bonds issued, and in such cases they are not recognised on the liability side of the consolidated balance sheet.
b. Other asset - backed securities: includes asset-backed securities, notes issued by securitization funds collateralized mainly by mortgage loans that do not meet the above requirements and other loans (mainly personal loans with an average maturity of five years and loans to SMEs with average maturities of seven years) and private issues of Santander Consumer USA Holdings Inc collateralized by vehicles assigned under operating leases.
2. Other mortgage securities include mainly: (i) mortgage-backed bonds with average maturities of more than ten years that are secured by a portfolio of mortgage loans and credits (included in secured loans —see note 10.b—) which must: not be classified as of procedural stage; have available appraisals performed by specialised entities; have a loan-to-value (LTV) ratio below 80% in the case of home loans and below 60% for loans for other assets and have sufficient liability insurance, (ii) other debt securities issued as part of the Group’s liquidity strategy in the UK, mainly covered bonds in the UK secured by mortgage loans and other assets.
The fair value of the guarantees received by the Group (financial and non-financial assets) which the Group is authorised to sell or pledge even if the owner of the guarantee has not defaulted is scantly material taking into account the Consolidated financial statements as a whole.
e) Spanish mortgage-market issues The members of the board of directors hereby state that the Group entities operating in the Spanish mortgage-market issues area have established and implemented specific policies and procedures to cover all activities carried on and guarantee strict compliance with mortgage-market regulations applicable to these activities as provided for in Royal Decree 716/2009, of 24 April implementing certain provisions of Mortgage Market Law 2/1981, of 25 March, and, by application thereof, in Bank of Spain Circulars 7/2010 and 5/2011, and other financial and mortgage system regulations. Also, financial management defines the Grupo Santander's funding strategy.
The risk policies applicable to mortgage market transactions envisage maximum loan-to-value (LTV) ratios, and specific policies are also in place adapted to each mortgage product, which occasionally require the application of stricter limits.
Grupo Santander’s general policies in this respect require the repayment capacity of each potential customer (the effort ratio in loan approval) to be analysed using specific indicators that must be met. This analysis must determine whether each customer’s income is sufficient to meet the repayments of the loan requested. In addition, the analysis of each customer must include a conclusion on the stability over time of the customer’s income considered with respect to the life of the loan. The aforementioned indicator used to measure the repayment capacity (effort ratio) of each potential customer takes into account mainly the relationship between the potential debt and the income generated, considering on the one hand the monthly repayments of the loan requested and other transactions and, on the other, the monthly salary income and duly supported income.
Grupo Santander entities have specialised document comparison procedures and tools for verifying customer information and solvency (see note 53).
Grupo Santander entities’ procedures envisage that each mortgage originated in the mortgage market must be individually valued by an appraisal company not related to the Group.
In accordance with Article 3 of Mortgage Market Law 41/2007, any appraisal company approved by the Bank of Spain may issue valid appraisal reports. However, as permitted by this same article, the Group entities perform several checks and select, from among these companies, a small group with which they enter into cooperation agreements with special conditions and automated control mechanisms. The Group’s internal regulations specify, in detail, each of the internally approved companies, as well as the approval requirements and procedures and the controls established to uphold them. In this connection, the regulations establish the functions of an appraisal company committee on which the various areas of the Group related to these companies are represented. The aim of the committee is to regulate and adapt the internal regulations and the activities of the appraisal companies to the current market and business situation (see note 2.i).

Auditor's Consolidated Notes to the consolidated Contents report financial statements financial statements Appendix. 
Basically, the companies wishing to cooperate with the Group must have a significant level of activity in the mortgage market in the area in which they operate, they must pass a preliminary screening process based on criteria of independence, technical capacity and solvency -in order to ascertain the continuity of their business- and, lastly, they must pass a series of tests prior to obtaining definitive approval.
In order to comply in full with the legislation, any appraisal provided by the customer is reviewed, irrespective of which appraisal company issues it, to check that the requirements, procedures and methods used to prepare it are formally adapted to the valued asset pursuant to current legislation and that the values reported are customary in the market.
The information required by Bank of Spain circulars 7/2010 and 5/2011, by application of Royal Decree 716/2009, of 24 April is as follows:
EUR million 2021 2020 2019. 
Face value of the outstanding mortgage loans and credits that support the issuance of mortgagebacked and mortgage bonds pursuant to Royal Decree 716/2009 (excluding securitised bonds)
Of which:
Loans eligible to cover issues of mortgage-backed securities. 
Transfers of assets retained on balance sheet: mortgage-backed certificates and other securitised mortgage assets 83,088 64,896 11,133 76,554 57,382 17,610 84,720 59,517 14,569. 
Mortgage-backed bonds. 
The mortgage-backed bonds ('cédulas hipotecarias') issued by the Group entities are securities the principal and interest of which are specifically secured by mortgages, there being no need for registration in the property register, by mortgage on all those that at any time are recorded in favour of the issuer and are not affected by the issuance of mortgage bonds and / or are subject to mortgage participations, and / or mortgage transfer certificates, and, if they exist, by substitution assets eligible to be hedged and for the economic flows generated by derivative financial instruments linked to each issue, and without prejudice to the issuer’s unlimited liability.
The mortgage bonds include the credit right of its holder against the issuing entity, guaranteeing in the manner provided for in the previous paragraph, and involve the execution to claim from the issuer the payment after due date. The holders of these securities are recognised as preferred creditors, singularly privileged, with the preference, included in number 3º of article 1,923 of the Spanish Civil Code against any other creditor, in relation with the entire group of loans and mortgage loans registered in favour of the issuer, except those that act as coverage for mortgage bonds and / or are subject to mortgage participations and / or mortgage transfer certificates.
In the event of insolvency, the holders of mortgage-backed bonds, as long as they are not considered 'person especially related' to the issuing entity in accordance with Royal Legislative Decree 1/2020, of 5 May, approving the revised text of the Bankruptcy Law , will enjoy the special privilege established in Article 270.1.1 of the aforementioned Bankruptcy Law. Without prejudice to the foregoing, in accordance with Article 242.10 of the Bankruptcy Law, during the insolvency proceedings, the payments relating to the repayment of the principal and interest of the bonds issued and outstanding at the date of the insolvency filing will be settled up to the amount of the income received by the insolvent party from the mortgage loans and credits and, where appropriate, from the replacement assets backing the bonds and from the cash flows generated by the financial instruments associated with the issues (Article 14 of Law 2/1981 of 25 March 1981 regulating the mortgage market).
If, due to a timing mismatch, the income received by the insolvent party is insufficient to meet the payments described in the preceding paragraph, the insolvency managers must settle them by realising the replacement assets set aside to cover the issue and, if this is not sufficient, they must obtain financing to meet the mandated payments to the holders of the mortgage-backed bonds, and the finance provider must be subrogated to the position of the bondholders.
In the event that it would be necessary to proceed in accordance with the terms of Article 212.1 and, in accordance with the requirements of Article 413 of the Insolvency Law, the payments to all holders of the mortgage-backed bonds issued would be made on a pro-rata basis, irrespective of the issue dates of the bonds. If the same credit or loan is subject to the payment of bonds and a mortgage bond issue, it will be paid first to the holders of the bonds.
The outstanding mortgage-backed bonds issued by Grupo Santander totalled EUR 23,197 million at 31 December 2021 (all of which were denominated in euros), of which EUR 22,747 million were issued by Banco Santander, S.A (with an outstanding face value of EUR 22,266 million), and EUR 450 million were issued by Santander Consumer Finance, S.A. The issues outstanding at 31 December 2021 and 2020 are detailed in the separate financial statements of each of these companies.
Mortgage-backed bond issuers have an early redemption option for the purpose of complying with the limits on the volume of outstanding mortgage-backed bonds stipulated by mortgage market regulations. In addition, the issuing entity may advance the mortgage-backed bonds, if this has been expressly established in the final conditions of the issue in question and under the conditions set out therein.
None of the mortgage-backed bonds issued by the Group entities had replacement assets assigned to them.

c) Other disclosures This caption includes contingent convertible or redeemable preferred participations, as well as other subordinated financial instruments issued by consolidated companies, which do not qualify as equity (preferred shares).
Preferred shares do not have voting rights and are non-cumulative. They have been subscribed by third parties outside the Group, and except for the issues of Santander UK plc, the rest are redeemable by decision of the issuer, according to the terms of each issue.
Banco Santander's contingently convertible preferred participations are subordinated debentures and rank after common creditors and any other subordinated credit that by law and/or by their terms, to the extent permitted by Spanish law, ranks higher than the contingently convertible preferred participations. Their remuneration is conditioned to the obtainment of sufficient distributable profits, and to the limitations imposed by the regulations on shareholders' equity, and they have no voting rights. The other issues of Banco Santander, S.A. mentioned in this caption are also subordinated debentures and, for credit ranking purposes, they rank behind all the common creditors of the issuing entities and ahead of any other subordinated credit that ranks pari passu with the Bank's contingently convertible preferred participations.

In addition, in various years some of the consolidated entities offered certain of their employees the possibility of taking pre-retirement and, therefore, provisions are recognised each year for the obligations to employees taking preretirement -in terms of salaries and other employee benefit costs- from the date of their pre-retirement to the agreed end date.
In 2019, the provisions accounted for benefit plans and contribution commitments were EUR 688 million.
In December 2020, Banco Santander reached an agreement with the workers' representatives to implement an early retirement and incentivized dismissals plan, which was expected to benefit 3,572 employees during 2021, constituting a provision to cover these commitments amounting to EUR 688 million. In addition to this plan, in 2020, 443 employees took advantage of the offer of early retirement and incentivized dismissals, increasing the provision made to cover these commitments to EUR 84 million. In 2021, due to the increase in the number of employees covered by the plan, a provision of EUR 139 million has been recognised.
In December 2019 Banco Santander reached an agreement with the workers' representatives to offer during 2020 to part of its passive personnel, the possibility of receiving the pensionable rights derived from the collective bargaining agreement in the form of a single consideration or divided into a maximum of 5 equal annuities. The proposal was also extended to personnel with pensionable rights recognized under individual contracts or agreements. The number of beneficiaries who exercised the voluntary option of accepting the substitution of the life annuity for the payment of a lump sum in the form of a capital sum or in instalments of a maximum of 5 annuities amounted to 15,613 people. The effect of the reduction of the aforementioned commitments is shown in the tables below under the headings 'Benefits paid in settlement' in the amount of EUR 1,551 million and 'Effect of reduction/settlement' in the amount of EUR 362 million.

On 8 July 2021, Banco Santander reached an agreement with the employee representatives for the transformation of defined benefit pension commitments into defined contributions for certain retired personnel from Banco Popular and Banco Pastor. Through the aforementioned Collective Agreement, it was agreed to carry out an offer to replace the life annuities that the passive personnel included in the scope of application of said Collective Agreement had been receiving, for a capitalization fund in the Santander Employees pension plan. The number of beneficiaries who exercised the voluntary option to accept the substitution of the life annuity for a capitalization fund in the Santander Employees pension plan amounted to 1,468 people.
The effect of the reduction of the aforementioned commitments is shown in the tables below under the headings 'Benefits paid by settlement' amounting to EUR 166 million and 'Effect reduction / settlement' amounting to EUR 36 million.
The expenses incurred by the Spanish companies in 2021, 2020 and 2019 in respect of contributions to defined contribution plans amounted to EUR 91 million, EUR 89 million and EUR 89 million, respectively.
The amount of the defined benefit obligations was determined on the basis of the work performed by independent actuaries using the following actuarial techniques.
1. Valuation method: projected unit credit method, which sees each period of service as giving rise to an additional unit of benefit entitlement and measures each unit separately.
2. Actuarial assumptions used: unbiased and mutually compatible. Specifically, the most significant actuarial assumptions used in the calculations were as follows:
Annual discount rate. 
Mortality tables. 
Cumulative annual CPI growth. 
Annual salary increase rate. 
Annual social security pension increase rate. 
Annual benefit increase rate.

The discount rate used for the flows was determined by reference to high-quality corporate bonds (at least AA in euros) matching the durations of the commitments. From the bond portfolio considered, callable, putable and sinkable bonds, which could distort the rates, are excluded.
Any changes in the main assumptions could affect the calculation of the obligations. At 31 December 2021, if the discount rate used had been decreased or increased by 50 basis points (bp), there would have been an increase or decrease in the present value of the postemployment obligations of 5.00% (-50 bp) to -5.06% (+50 bp),respectively, and an increase or decrease in the present value of the long-term obligations of 1.18% (-50 bp) to -1.18% (+50 bp), respectively.

Auditor's Consolidated Notes to the consolidated Contents report financial statements financial statements Appendix. 
In view of the conversion of the defined-benefit obligations to defined-contribution obligations, the Group has not made material current contributions in Spain in 2021 to fund its defined-benefit pension obligations.
The plan assets and the insurance contracts linked to pensions are instrumented mainly through insurance policies.
The following table shows the estimated benefits payable at 31 December 2021 for the next ten years:
EUR million 2022 606 2023 466 2024 402 2025 333 2026 284 2027 to 2031 904 ii. United Kingdom At the end of each of the last three years, the businesses in the United Kingdom had post-employment benefit obligations under defined contribution and defined benefit plans. The expenses incurred in respect of contributions to defined contribution plans amounted to EUR 89 million in 2021 (EUR 91 million in 2020 and EUR 93 million in 2019).
The amount of the defined benefit obligations was determined on the basis of the work performed by independent actuaries using the following actuarial techniques: 1. Valuation method: projected unit credit method, which sees each period of service as giving rise to an additional unit of benefit entitlement and measures each unit separately.
2. Actuarial assumptions used: unbiased and mutually compatible. Specifically, the most significant actuarial assumptions used in the calculations were as follows: 2021 2020 2019.

Annual salary increase rate 1.00 % 1.00 % 1.00 %
Annual pension increase rate 3.21 % 2.85 % 2.91 %
The discount rate used for the flows was determined by reference to high-quality corporate bonds (at least AA in pounds sterling) that coincide with the terms of the obligations.
Any changes in the main assumptions could affect the calculation of the obligations. At 31 December 2021, if the discount rate used had been decreased or increased by 50 basis points, there would have been an increase or decrease in the present value of the obligations of 9.74% (-50 bp) and -8.67% (+50 bp), respectively. If the inflation assumption had been increased or decreased by 50 basis points, there would have been an increase or decrease in the present value of the obligations of 6.19% (+50 bp) and -6.00% (-50 bp), respectively. These changes would be offset in part by increases or decreases in the fair value of the assets.
The funding status of the defined benefit obligations in 2021 and the two preceding years is as follows:

At 31 December 2021, 2020 and 2019, these entities had definedcontribution and defined-benefit post-employment benefit obligations. The expenses incurred in respect of contributions to defined contribution plans amounted to EUR 106 million in 2021 (EUR 103 million at 31 December 2020 and EUR 110 million at 31 December 2019).
The actuarial assumptions used by these entities (discount rates, mortality tables and cumulative annual CPI growth) are consistent with the economic and social conditions prevailing in the countries in which they are located.
Specifically, the discount rate used for the flows was determined by reference to high-quality corporate bonds, except in the case of Brazil where there is no extensive corporate bond market and, accordingly the discount rate was determined by reference to the series B bonds issued by the Brazilian National Treasury Secretariat for a term coinciding with that of the obligations. In Brazil the discount rate used was between 8.39% and 8.44%, the CPI 3.00% and the mortality table the AT - 2000 Basic.
Any changes in the main assumptions could affect the calculation of the obligations. At 31 December 2021, if the discount rate used had been decreased or increased by 50 basis points, there would have been an increase or decrease in the present value of the obligations of 4.78% and -4.40%, respectively. These changes would be offset in part by increases or decreases in the fair value of the assets.

The definitive date of the outflow of resources embodying economic benefits for the Group depends on each obligation. In certain cases, these obligations have no fixed settlement period and, in other cases, depend on the legal proceedings in progress.
The detail, by geographical area, of Provisions for taxes and other legal contingencies and Other provisions is as follows:
EUR million 2021 2020 2019. 
Recognised by Spanish companies 1,595 1,647 1,381.

Set forth below is the detail, by type of provision, of the balance at 31 December 2021, 2020 and 2019 of Provisions for taxes and other legal contingencies and Other provisions.
The types of provision were determined by grouping together items of a similar nature:
EUR million 2021 2020 2019. 
Provisions for taxes 564 600 759. 
Provisions for employment-related proceedings (Brazil) 328 437 776.

Provision for restructuring 749 810 641. 
Other 897 951 1,018 4,423 4,425 5,508. 
Relevant information is set forth below in relation to each type of provision shown in the preceding table:
The provisions for taxes include provisions for tax-related proceedings.
The provisions for employment-related proceedings (Brazil) relate to claims filed by trade unions, associations, the prosecutor’s office and ex-employees claiming employment rights to which, in their view, they are entitled, particularly the payment of overtime and other employment rights, including litigation concerning retirement benefits. The number and nature of these proceedings, which are common for banks in Brazil, justify the classification of these provisions in a separate category or as a separate type from the rest. The Group calculates the provisions associated with these claims in accordance with past experience of payments made in relation to claims for similar items. When claims do not fall within these categories, a case-by-case assessment is performed and the amount of the provision is calculated in accordance with the status of each proceeding and the risk assessment carried out by the legal advisers.
The provisions for other legal proceedings include provisions for court, arbitration or administrative proceedings (other than those included in other categories or types of provisions disclosed separately) brought against Santander Group companies.
The provisions for customer remediation include mainly the estimated cost of payments to remedy errors relating to the sale of certain products in the UK, as well as the impact of Swiss franc (CHF) mortgage portfolios in Poland and the estimated amount related to the floor clauses of Banco Popular Español, S.A.U. To calculate the provision for customer remediation, the best estimate of the provision made by management is used, which is based on the estimated number of claims to be received and, of these, the number that will be accepted, as well as the estimated average payment per case.
The regulatory framework-related provisions include mainly the provisions relating to the FSCS (Financial Services Compensation Scheme), the Bank Levy in the UK and in Poland the provision related to the Banking Tax.
The provisions for restructuring include only the costs arising from restructuring processes carried out by the various Group companies.
Lastly, the 'Other' heading contains very atomized and individually insignificant provisions, such as the provisions to cover the operational risk.

Auditor's Consolidated Notes to the consolidated Contents report financial statements financial statements Appendix. 
Qualitative information on the main litigation is provided in note 25.e to the consolidated financial statements.
The group's general policy is to record provisions for tax and legal proceedings in which we assess the chances of loss to be probable and we do not record provisions when the chances of loss are possible or remote. We determine the amounts to be provided for as our best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the corresponding claim based, among other factors, on a case-by-case analysis of the facts and the legal opinion of internal and external counsel or by considering the historical average amount of the loss incurred in claims of the same nature. The definitive date of the outflow of resources embodying economic benefits for the Group depends on each obligation. In certain cases, the obligations do not have a fixed settlement term and, in others, they depend on legal proceedings in progress.
The main movements during the 2021 of the breakdown provisions are shown below:
With respect to provisions for labor and other legal proceedings, in Brazil, provisions of EUR 155 million and EUR 168 million were recorded, making payments of EUR 289 million and EUR 205 million, respectively.
With respect to provisions for customer compensation an amount of EUR 319 million was provided in Poland to cover the CHF mortgage portfolio in the year.
On the regulatory framework side, EUR 69 million was provisioned in the United Kingdom and a utilization of EUR 104 million was made in the year (Bank Levy). In addition, in Poland, EUR 131 million were recorded under the regulatory framework and paid during the year.
In addition, the restructuring provision includes provisions of EUR 598 million mainly in the UK and Portugal, as well as the payments made by the Group during the year.
e) Litigation and other matters i. Tax-related litigation At 31 December 2021 the main tax-related proceedings concerning the Group were as follows: • Legal actions filed by Banco Santander (Brasil) S.A. and other Group entities to avoid the application of Law 9.718/98, which modifies the basis to calculate PIS and COFINS social contribution, extending it to all the entities income, and not only to the income from the provision of services. In relation of Banco Santander (Brasil) S.A. process, in May 2015 the Federal Supreme Court (FSC) admitted the extraordinary appeal filed by the Federal Union regarding PIS, and dismissed the extraordinary appeal lodged by the Brazilian Public Prosecutor's Office regarding COFINS contribution, confirming the decision of Federal Regional Court favourable to Banco Santander (Brasil) S.A. of August 2007. The appeals filed by the other entities before the Federal Supreme Court, both for PIS and COFINS, are still pending. These claims are fully provisioned.
• Banco Santander (Brasil) S.A. and other Group companies in Brazil have appealed against the assessments issued by the Brazilian tax authorities questioning the deduction of loan losses in their income tax returns (IRPJ and CSLL) in relation to different administrative processes of various years on the ground that the requirements under the applicable legislation were not met. The appeals are pending decision in CARF. No provision was recognised in connection with the amount considered to be a contingent liability.
• Banco Santander (Brasil) S.A. and other Group companies in Brazil are involved in administrative and legal proceedings against several municipalities that demand payment of the Service Tax on certain items of income from transactions not classified as provisions of services. There are several cases in different judicial instances. A provision was recognised in connection with the amount of the estimated loss.
• Banco Santander (Brasil) S.A. and other Group companies in Brazil are involved in administrative and legal proceedings against the tax authorities in connection with the taxation for social security purposes of certain items which are not considered to be employee remuneration. There are several cases in different judicial instances. A provision was recognised in connection with the amount of the estimated loss.
• In May 2003 the Brazilian tax authorities issued separate infringement notices against Santander Distribuidora de Títulos e Valores Mobiliarios, Ltda. (DTVM, actually Santander Brasil Tecnología S.A.) and Banco Santander (Brasil) S.A. in relation to the Provisional Tax on Financial Movements (CPMF) of the years 2000 to 2002. The administrative discussion ended unfavourably for both companies, and on July 3, 2015, filed a lawsuit requesting the cancellation of both tax assessments. The lawsuit was judged unfavourably in first instance. Therefore, both plaintiffs appealed to the court of second instance. On December 2020, the appeal was decided unfavourably. Against the judgment, the bank filed a motion for clarification which has not been accepted. Currently it is appealed to higher courts. There is a provision recognized for the estimated loss.
• In December 2010 the Brazilian tax authorities issued an infringement notice against Santander Seguros S.A. (Brazil), currently Zurich Santander Brasil Seguros e Previdência S.A., as the successor by merger to ABN AMRO Brasil dois Participações S.A., in relation to income tax (IRPJ and CSLL) for 2005, questioning the tax treatment applied to a sale of shares of Real Seguros, S.A. The administrative discussion ended unfavourably, and the CARF decision has been appealed at the Federal Justice. As the former parent of Santander Seguros S.A. (Brasil), Banco Santander (Brasil) S.A. is liable in the event of any adverse outcome of this proceeding. No provision was recognised in connection with this proceeding as it is considered to be a contingent liability.
• In November 2014 the Brazilian tax authorities issued an infringement notice against Banco Santander (Brasil) S.A. in relation to corporate income tax (IRPJ and CSLL) for 2009 questioning the tax-deductibility of the amortisation of the goodwill of Banco ABN AMRO Real S.A. performed prior to the absorption of this bank by Banco Santander (Brasil) S.A., but accepting the amortisation performed after the merger. Actually it is appealed before the Higher Chamber of CARF. No provision was recognised in connection with this proceeding as it was considered to be a contingent liability.

Auditor's Consolidated Notes to the consolidated Contents report financial statements financial statements Appendix • Banco Santander (Brasil) S.A. has also appealed against infringement notices issued by the tax authorities questioning the tax deductibility of the amortisation of the goodwill arising on the acquisition of Banco Comercial e de Investimento Sudameris S.A from years 2007 to 2012. No provision was recognised in connection with this matter as it was considered to be a contingent liability.
• Banco Santander (Brasil) S.A. and other companies of the Group in Brazil are undergoing administrative and judicial procedures against Brazilian tax authorities for not admitting tax compensation with credits derived from other tax concepts, not having registered a provision for the amount considered to be a contingent liability.
• Banco Santander (Brasil) S.A. is involved in appeals in relation to infringement notices initiated by tax authorities regarding the offsetting of tax losses in the CSLL (‘Social Contribution on Net Income’) of year 2009. The appeal is pending decision in CARF. No provision was recognised in connection with this matter as it is considered to be a contingent liability.
• Brazilian tax authorities have issued infringement notices against Getnet Adquirência e Serviços para Meios de Pagamento S.A and Banco Santander (Brasil) S.A. as jointly liable in relation to corporate income tax (IRPJ and CSLL) for 2014 to 2018 questioning the tax-deductibility of the amortization of the goodwill from the acquisition of Getnet Tecnologia Proces S.A., considering that the company would not have complied with the legal requirements for such amortization. A defense against the tax assessment notices were submitted, and the appeal is pending decision in CARF. No provision was recognized as it is considered to be a contingent liability.
The total amount for the aforementioned Brazil lawsuits that are fully provisioned is EUR 848 million, and for lawsuits that qualify as contingent liabilities is EUR 3,690 million.
• Legal action brought by Sovereign Bancorp, Inc. (currently Santander Holdings USA, Inc.) claiming its right to take a foreign tax credit for taxes paid outside the United States in fiscal years 2003 to 2005 as well as the related issuance and financing costs. On 17 July 2018, the District Court finally ruled against Santander Holdings USA, Inc. On September 5, 2019 the Federal District Court in Massachusetts entered a judgement resolving the Company’s tax liability for fiscal years 2003 to 2005, which had no effect on income. The Company has agreed to resolve the treatment of the same transactions for 2006 and 2007, consistent with the September 5, 2019 judgment. The Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation has completed its review of the proposed resolution of the 2006 and 2007 tax years, with no objection. The IRS finalized its administrative process to close-out the issue, which resulted in no impact on net income.
• Banco Santander appealed before European Courts the Decisions 2011/5/CE of 28 October 2009 (First Decision), and 2011/282/UE of 12 January 2011 (Second Decision) of the European Commission, ruling that the deduction of the financial goodwill regulated pursuant to Article 12.5 of the Corporate Income Tax Law constituted illegal State aid. On October 2021 the Court of Justice has definitively confirmed these Decisions. The dismissal of the appeal, that only affects these two decisions, has no effect on equity.
At the date of approval of these interim financial statements certain other less significant tax-related proceedings are also in progress.
ii. Non-tax-related proceedings At 31 December 2021 the main non-tax-related proceedings concerning the Group were as follows: • Payment Protection Insurance (PPI): In recent years Santander UK plc has processed customer claims associated with the sale of payment protection insurance (PPI), derived from the Financial Conduct Authority guidelines. As of 31 December 2021 there is no provision related to those claims as the deadline for presenting them has already expired. However, customers can still commence in-court litigation for the mis-sale of PPI and a provision for the best estimate of any obligation to pay compensation in respect of current and future claims is recognized for this purpose.
In addition, there is a legal dispute regarding allocation of liability for pre-2005 PPI policies underwritten by two entities (Axa France) that Axa Group acquired from Genworth Financial International Holdings, Inc. in September 2015. The dispute involves Santander Cards UK Limited (formerly known as GE Capital Bank Limited which was acquired by Banco Santander, S.A. from GE Capital group in 2008) which was the distributor of the policies in dispute and Santander Insurance Services UK Limited (the Santander Entities).
In July 2017, the Santander Entities notified Axa France that they did not accept liability for losses on PPI policies relating to the referred period. Santander UK plc entered in a Complaints Handling Agreement –that included a standstill agreement- agreeing to handle complaints on Axa France, whilst Axa France accepted paying redress assessed to be due to relevant policyholders on a without prejudice basis.
After the termination of the Complaints Handling Agreement, on 30 December 2020 Axa France provided written notice to the Santander Entities to terminate the standstill agreement. On 5 March 2021, the Santander Entities were served with a Claim Form and Brief Details of Claim by Axa France, claiming that the Santander Entities are liable to reimburse Axa France for pre-2005 PPI mis-selling losses, currently estimated at GBP 636 million (EUR 739 million). On 22 March 2021, the Santander Entities acknowledged service of the claim and notified the court of their intention to defend the claim in full and issued an application for Axa Frances’s claim to be struck out/summarily dismissed, which is being heard by the Commercial Court on 22 and 23 February 2022. Decision is not expected until second quarter 2022.
In the event the claim is not dismissed, there are still ongoing factual issues to be resolved during the trial, which may have legal consequences including in relation to liability. These issues create uncertainties which mean that it is difficult to reliably predict the outcome or the timing of the resolution of the matter. The provision includes our best estimate of the Santander Entities’ liability for this matter.

Auditor's Consolidated Notes to the consolidated Contents report financial statements financial statements Appendix • Delforca: dispute arising from equity swaps entered into by Gaesco (now Delforca 2008, S.A.) on shares of Inmobiliaria Colonial, S.A. Banco Santander, S.A. is claiming to Delforca before the Court of Barcelona in charge of the bankruptcy proceedings, a total of EUR 66 million from the liquidation resulting from the early termination of financial transactions due to Delforca's nonpayment of the equity swaps. In the same bankruptcy proceedings, Delforca and Mobiliaria Monesa have in turn claimed the Bank to repay EUR 57 million, which the Bank received for the enforcement of the agreed guarantee, as a result of the aforementioned liquidation. On 16 September 2021 the Commercial Court Number 10 of Barcelona has ordered Delforca to pay the Bank EUR 66 million plus EUR 11 million in interest and has dismissed the claims filed by Delforca. This decision has been appealed by Delforca, Mobiliaria Monesa and the bankruptcy administrator. The appeal which the Bank has already opposed to will be resolved by the Provincial Court of Barcelona.
Separately, Mobiliaria Monesa, S.A. (parent of Delforca) filed in 2009 a civil procedure with the Courts of Santander against the Bank claiming damages that have not been specified to date. The procedure is suspended.
• Former employees of Banco do Estado de São Paulo S.A., Santander Banespa, Cia. de Arrendamiento Mercantil: claim initiated in 1998 by the association of retired Banespa employees (AFABESP) requesting the payment of a half-yearly bonus contemplated in the by-laws of Banespa in the event that Banespa obtained a profit and that the distribution of this profit were approved by the Board of Directors. The bonus was not paid in 1994 and 1995 since Banespa had not made a profit during those years. Partial payments were made from 1996 to 2000, as approved by the Board of Directors. The relevant clause was eliminated in 2001. The Tribunal Regional do Trabalho (Regional Labour Court) and the High Employment Court (TST) ordered Santander Brazil, as successor to Banespa, to pay this half-yearly bonus for the period from 1996 to the present. On 20 March 2019, the Supreme Federal Court (STF) rejected the extraordinary appeal filed by Santander Brazil.
Santander Bank Brazil filed a rescissory action before the TST to nullify the decisions of the main proceedings and suspend the execution of the judgment, which was deemed inadmissible, therefore its execution was suspended. The rescissory action was dismissed and a motion for clarification was filed, due to the absence of an explicit argument to deny the rescissory action filed by Santander Brazil. After the decision of the motion for clarification, Santander Brazil filed an extraordinary appeal in the rescissory action in February 2021, which was denied in an interlocutory decision in June 2021 by the TST. As Santander Brazil understands there is a conflict between the TST decision and the doctrine set by the STF, Santander Brazil has appealed this decision. This appeal is pending.
In August 2021, a first instance court has ruled that the enforcement of the TST decision shall be carried out individually, at the jurisdiction pertaining to each person. AFABESP appealed this decision. In December 2021, the Regional Labor Court denied the appeal filed by AFABESP. This decision has not been appealed by AFABESP, and therefore it has become firm.
Santander Brazil external advisers have classified the risk as probable. The recorded provisions are considered sufficient to cover the risks associated with the legal claims that are being substantiated as of 31 December 2021.
• 'Planos Económicos': like the rest of the banking system in Brasil, Santander Brazil has been the target of customer complaints and collective civil suits stemming mainly from legislative changes and its application to bank deposits ('economic plans'). At the end of 2017, an agreement between regulatory entities and the Brazilian Federation of Banks (Febraban) with the purpose of closing the lawsuits was reached and was approved by the Supremo Tribunal Federal. Discussions focused on specifying the amount to be paid to each affected client according to the balance in their notebook at the time of the Plan. Finally, the total value of the payments will depend on the number of adhesions there may be and the number of savers who have demonstrated the existence of the account and its balance on the date the indexes were changed. In November 2018, the STF ordered the suspension of all economic plan proceedings for two years from May 2018. On 29 May 2020, the STF approved the extension of the agreement for 5 additional years starting from 3 June 2020. Condition for this extension was to include in the agreement actions related to the “Collor I Plan”. On 31 December 2021, the provision recorded for the economic plan proceedings amounts to EUR 277 million.
• Floor clauses: as a consequence of the acquisition of Banco Popular Español, S.A.U. the Group has been exposed to a material number of transactions with floor clauses. The so-called "floor clauses" are those under which the borrower accepts a minimum interest rate to be paid to the lender, regardless of the applicable reference interest rate. Banco Popular Español, S.A.U. included "floor clauses" in certain asset-side transactions with customers. In relation to this type of clauses, and after several rulings made by the Court of Justice of the European Union and the Spanish Supreme Court, and the extrajudicial process established by the Spanish Royal Decree-Law 1/2017, of 20 January, Banco Popular Español, S.A.U. made provisions that were updated in order to cover the effect of the potential return of the excess interest charged for the application of the floor clauses between the contract date of the corresponding mortgage loans and May 2013. At 31 December 2021, after having processed most of the customer requests, the potential residual loss associated with ongoing court proceedings is estimated at EUR 46 million, amount which is fully covered by provisions.
• Banco Popular´s acquisition: considering the declaration setting out the resolution of Banco Popular Español, S.A.U., the redemption and conversion of its capital instruments and the subsequent transfer to Banco Santander, S.A. of the shares resulting from this conversion in exercise of the resolution instrument involving the sale of the institution's business, in application of the single resolution framework regulation, some investors have filed claims against the EU’s Single Resolution Board decision, the FROB's resolution executed in accordance to the aforementioned decision, and claims have been filed and may be filed in the future against Banco Santander, S.A. or other Santander Group companies deriving from or related to the acquisition of Banco Popular Español, S.A.U..

Auditor's Consolidated Notes to the consolidated Contents report financial statements financial statements Appendix. 
At this stage, it is not possible to foresee the total number of claims that could be filed by the former holders of shares and capital instruments (arising from the acquisition by investors of such shares and capital instruments of Banco Popular prior to resolution, including in particular, without limitation, the shares acquired in the context of the capital increase with pre-emptive subscription rights carried out in 2016), and their economic implications (especially considering that the decision to resolve in application of the new regulation has no precedent, and that it may be possible that future claims do not specify a specific amount, put forward new legal interpretations or involve a large number of parties).
In this respect, on 2 September 2020, the Provincial Court of La Coruña has referred a preliminary ruling to the Court of Justice of the European Union (“CJEU”) asking for the correct interpretation of Article 60(2) of Directive 2014/59/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council, dated 15 May 2014, which establishes a framework for the restructuring and resolution of credit institutions and investment firms. This article establishes that, in cases of redemption of capital instruments in a bank resolution, no liability shall remain in relation to the amount of the instrument that has been redeemed. On 2 December 2021, the CJEU Advocate General issued his opinion, considering that the Directive precludes former Banco Popular shareholders from bringing claims for compensation against Banco Santander. The judgement of the CJEU in this case is still pending and is likely to condition the outcome on the judicial proceedings that are currently ongoing.
Likewise, the Central Court of Instruction 4 is currently conducting preliminary proceedings 42/2017, in which, amongst other things, is being investigated the following: (i) the accuracy of the prospectus for the capital increase with subscription rights carried out by Banco Popular in 2016; and (ii) the alleged manipulation of the share price of Banco Popular until the resolution of the bank, in June 2017. During the course of the proceedings, on 30 April 2019, the Spanish National Court, ruled in favour of Banco Santander, S.A. declaring that Banco Santander, S.A. cannot inherit Banco Popular’s potential criminal liability. This ruling was appealed before the Supreme Court, which rejected it. In this proceedings, Banco Santander, S.A. could potentially be subsidiarily liable for the civil consequences.
The estimated cost of any compensation to shareholders and bondholders of Banco Popular recognized in the 2017 accounts amounted to EUR 680 million, of which EUR 535 million were applied to the commercial loyalty program. At 31 December 2021, the provisions recorded are considered sufficient to cover the risks associated with the court claims that can be estimated to date. However, if additional amounts have to be paid for claims already raised with an undetermined economic interest or for new claims which cannot be reliably estimated because of their specific circumstances, this could have a significant adverse effect on the Santander Group's results and financial situation.
• German shares investigation: the Cologne Public Prosecution Office is conducting an investigation against the Bank, and other group entities based in UK - Santander UK plc, Santander Financial Services Plc and Cater Allen International Limited -, in relation to a particular type of tax dividend linked transactions known as cumex transactions.
The Group is cooperating with the German authorities. According to the state of the investigations, the result and the effects for the Group, which may potentially include the imposition of material financial penalties, cannot be anticipated. For this reason, the Bank has not recognized any provisions in relation to the potential imposition of financial penalties.
• Banco Santander, S.A. has been sued in a legal proceeding in which the plaintiff alleges that a contract was concluded whereby he would be entrusted with the functions of CEO of the Bank. In the complaint, the claimant mainly requests a declaratory ruling that affirms the validity and conclusion of such contract and its enforcement together with the payment of certain amounts. If the main request is not granted, the claimant sought a compensation for a total amount of approximately EUR 112 million or, an alternative relief for other minor amounts. Banco Santander, S.A. answered to the complaint stating that the conditions to which the appointment was subject to were not met and that the contract required by law was not concluded. On 17 May 2021, the plaintiff reduced his claims for compensation to EUR 61.9 million.
On 9 December 2021, the Court has rendered its decision ordering the Bank to compensate the plaintiff in the amount of EUR 67.8 million. On 13 January 2022, the Court has corrected and supplemented its judgment, reducing the total amount to EUR 51.4 million and establishing that part of this amount (EUR 18.6 million) would have to be paid in shares of Banco Santander and subject to the application of the same terms provided in the applicable Santander executives’ remuneration program (on a deferred basis, and in accordance with the applicable plan in the offer). The Bank will file appeal against the judgment before the Provincial Court of Madrid. The provisions recorded are considered to be sufficient to cover the risks deriving from this claim.
• Universalpay Entidad de Pago, S.L. has filed a lawsuit against Banco Santander, S.A. for breach of the marketing alliance agreement (MAA) and claim payment (EUR 1,050 million). The claim is being processed in the Court of First Instance no. 81 of Madrid. The MAA was originally entered into by Banco Popular Español, S.A.U. and its purpose is the rendering of acquiring services (point of sale payment terminals) for businesses in the Spanish market. The lawsuit is mainly based on the potential breach of clause 6 of the MAA, which establishes certain obligations of exclusivity, noncompetition and customer referral. The claim is at a very early stage, and there are factual issues pending resolution, which may have legal consequences and affect any potential liability. This uncertainty makes it impossible to reliably predict the resolution of the issue, the timing or the significance of the potential economic impact. The Bank has answered the complaint. The pretrial hearing could not take place on 16 December 2021 and has been rescheduled on 11 March 2022.
• CHF Polish Mortgage Loans: On 3 October 2019, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) rendered its decision in relation to a judicial proceeding against an unrelated bank in Poland considering that certain contractual clauses in CHF-indexed loan agreements were abusive. The CJEU has left to Polish courts the decision on whether the whole contract can be maintained once the abusive terms have been removed, which should in turn decide whether the effects of the annulment of the contract are prejudicial to the consumer. In case of maintenance of the contract, the court may only integrate the contract with subsidiary provisions of national law and decide, in accordance with those provisions, on the applicable rate.

Auditor's Consolidated Notes to the consolidated Contents report financial statements financial statements Appendix. 
On 2 September 2021, the Supreme Court was expected to take a position regarding the key issues in disputes concerning loans based on foreign currency, clarifying the discrepancies and unifying case law. The resolution was not adopted and instead, the Supreme Court referred questions to the CJEU on constitutional issues of the Polish judiciary system. No new date for consideration of the issue has been set and no comprehensive decision by the Supreme Court on CHF of the issue is expected in the near future. In the absence of a comprehensive position of the Supreme Court, it is difficult to expect a full unification of judicial decisions, and decisions of the Supreme Court and CJEU issued on particular issues may be important for shaping further case law on CHF matters.
As of 31 December 2021, Santander Bank Polska S.A. and Santander Consumer Bank S.A. maintain a portfolio of mortgages denominated in or indexed to CHF for an approximate amount of 9,265 million zlotys (EUR 2,083 million). During the year, provisions recorded amounted to 1,453 million zlotys (EUR 319 million), leaving the provision fund as of 31 December 2021 at 2,056 million zlotys (EUR 447 million). This provision represents the best estimate at 31 December 2021 given the difficulty to predict the financial impact, as it is for national courts to decide the relevant issues and the process of analyzing and deciding on the KNF proposal described below has not yet been completed. Santander Bank Polska and Santander Consumer Bank Poland will continue to monitor and assess appropriateness of those provisions.
In December 2020, the Chairman of the Polish Financial Supervision Authority (KNF) presented a proposal for voluntary settlements between banks and borrowers under which CHF loans would be retrospectively settled as PLN loans bearing an interest rate based on WIBOR plus margin. This proposal is currently under analysis within Santander Bank Polska S.A. and Santander Consumer Bank S.A., depending on the results of this analysis, Santander Bank Polska and Santander Consumer Bank Poland will decide whether to adhere to this proposal and will proceed to include additional scenarios in the models for calculating provisions and reflect the estimated impact on their level.
While the above referred events could lead to significant changes in the level of expected provisions, in the opinion of Santander Bank Polska S.A. and Santander Consumer Bank S.A., it is not possible to reliably estimate the value of their impact on their financial position at 31 December 2021.
• Banco Santander Mexico. Dispute regarding a testamentary trust constituted in 1994 by Mr. Roberto Garza Sada in Banca Serfin (currently Santander Mexico) in favor of his four sons in which he affected shares of Alfa, S.A.B. de C.V. (respectively, "Alfa" and the "Trust"). During 1999, Mr. Roberto Garza Sada instructed Santander México in its capacity as trustee to transfer 36,700,000 shares from the Trust's assets to his sons and daughters and himself. These instructions were ratified in 2004 by Mr. Roberto Garza Sada before a Notary Public.
Mr. Roberto Garza Sada, passed away on 14 August 2010 and subsequently, in 2012, his daughters filed a complaint against Santander Mexico alleging it had been negligent in its trustee role. The lawsuit was dismissed at first instance in April 2017 and on appeal in 2018. In May 2018, the plaintiffs filed an appeal (recurso de amparo) before the First Collegiate Court of the Fourth Circuit based in Nuevo León, which ruled in favor of the plaintiffs on 7 May 2021, annulling the 2018 appeal judgment and condemning Santander Mexico to the petitions claimed, consisting of the recovery of the amount of 36,700,000 Alfa shares, together with dividends, interest and damages.
On 7 June 2021, Santander México filed an appeal for constitutional review against the decision of the Collegiate Court before the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation, considering that this court was not empowered to resolve substantive issues that had not been raised by the parties, lack of procedural standing, and the absence of a decision imposing the plaintiffs to pay costs. This appeal was rejected by the President of the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation on 1 October 2021 on the grounds that the matter, although it refers to constitutional matters, is not of exceptional interest.
On 6 October 2021, Santander México filed an appeal against this decision before the Supreme Court itself, which was rejected in limine by the President of the Court by order dated 11 October 2021, considering that against the dismissal of the appeal for constitutional review, there is no possible appeal pursuant to the Constitutional Reform of March 2021. Against this decision, on 8 December 2021, a new appeal was filed for this matter to be reviewed by the First Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation, considering that the failure to accept the appeal constitutes a retroactive application of the law, and that this violates the transitory fifth article of the reform of the “Ley de Amparo” published on 7 June 2021.
In compliance with the aforementioned ruling of 7th May 2021, the Seventh Civil Chamber of the Superior Court of Justice of Nuevo León has issued a judgement imposing Santander Mexico to pay the benefits claimed by the plaintiffs. As a result of this judgement, Santander Mexico has filed a new appeal (recurso de amparo) and will request that it be resolved by the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation.
Santander México estimates that the actions taken should prevail and reverse the decision against it. However, given the procedural stage of the case, Santander México has classified this risk as possible. The impact of a potential unfavorable resolution for Santander México will be determined in a subsequent proceeding and will also depend on the additional actions that Santander México may take in its defense, so it is not possible to determine it at this time.

Auditor's Consolidated Notes to the consolidated Contents report financial statements financial statements Appendix • URO Property Holdings, SOCIMI SA: In December 2021, BNP Paribas Trust Corporation UK Limited (“BNP”) informed Uro Property Holdings SOCIMI, SA (“Uro”) – subsidiary from Banco Santander, S.A.-, that it is considering taking legal action against Uro. On 16 February 2022, BNP commenced legal proceedings against Uro in the Commercial Court in London. On 31 December 2021, Uro lost its status as a SOCIMI (Sociedad Anónima Cotizada de Inversión Inmobiliaria). The potential litigation concerns certain terms of a financing granted to Uro which was supported by a bond issue in 2015. BNP, acting as trustee on behalf of the bondholders, claims that based on those terms, and in relation to the loss of SOCIMI status, Uro would be obliged to pay an additional premium above the nominal value of the financing repayment. Uro denies being liable to pay that additional premium and intends to defend the claim. It is estimated that the maximum loss associated with this possible contingency, amounts to approximately EUR 250 million. There is no date for trial hearing yet.
Banco Santander and the other Group companies are subject to claims and, therefore, are party to certain legal proceedings incidental to the normal course of their business including those in connection with lending activities, relationships with employees and other commercial or tax matters additional to those referred to here.
With the information available to it, the Group considers that, at 31 December 2021, it had reliably estimated the obligations associated with each proceeding and had recognized, where necessary, sufficient provisions to cover reasonably any liabilities that may arise as a result of these tax and legal risks. Disputes in which provisions have been registered but are not disclosed is justified on the basis that it would be prejudicial to the proper defense of the Group. Subject to the qualifications made, it also believes that any liability arising from such claims and proceedings will not have, overall, a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial position, or results of operations.
26. Other liabilities. 
The detail of Other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets is as follows:
EUR million 2021 2020 2019. 
Transactions in transit 545 498 663. 
Accrued expenses and deferred income 7,084 6,309 6,909. 
Other 5,069 5,529 5,220 12,698 12,336 12,792 27. Tax matters a) Consolidated Tax Group. 
Pursuant to current legislation, the Consolidated Tax Group includes Banco Santander, S.A. (as the parent) and the Spanish subsidiaries that meet the requirements provided for in Spanish legislation regulating the taxation of the consolidated profits of corporate groups (as the controlled entities).
The other Group companies file income tax return in accordance with the tax regulations applicable to them.
b) Years open for review by the tax authorities. 
In June and November 2021 acts with agreement, conformity and non-conformity relating to the corporate income tax financial years 2012 to 2015 were formalised. The adjustments signed in conformity and with agreement had not impact on results and, in relation to the concepts signed in disconformity both in this year and in previous years (corporate income tax 2003 to 2011), Banco Santander, S.A., as the Parent of the Consolidated Tax Group, considers, in accordance with the advice of its external lawyers, that the adjustments made should not have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements, as there are sound arguments as proof in the appeals filed against them pending at the National Appellate Court (tax years 2003 to 2011) and at different administrative instances (tax years 2012-2015). Consequently, no provision has been recorded for this concept. It should also be noted that, in those cases where it has been considered appropriate, the mechanisms available to avoid international double taxation have been used. At the date of approval of these accounts, the Corporate Income Tax and other taxes audit for periods 2017 to 2019 are ongoing, and subsequent years up to and including 2021, are subject to review.
Likewise, relating the Consolidated Tax Group of which Banco Popular Español, S.A.U. was the parent, during 2019, a certificate of disconformity was drawn up for 2017 corporate income tax, with no impact on profit, and the final assessment was appealed. In relation to this Consolidated Tax Group, the years 2016 and 2017 inclusive are subject to review. On 1 January 2018 those entities that were part of the aforementioned Consolidated Tax Group were integrated in the Consolidate Tax Group which parent company is Banco Santander.
The other entities have the corresponding years open for review, pursuant to their respective tax regulations.
Because of the possible different interpretations which can be made of the tax regulations, the outcome of the tax audits of the rest of years subject to review might give rise to contingent tax liabilities which cannot be objectively quantified. However, the Group’s tax advisers consider that it is unlikely that such tax liabilities will materialize, and that in any event the tax charge arising therefrom would not materially affect the Group’s consolidated financial statements.

Auditor's Consolidated Contents report financial statements e) Deferred taxes 'Tax assets' in the consolidated balance sheets includes debit balances with the Public Treasury relating to deferred tax assets. 'Tax liabilities' includes the liability for the Group’s various deferred tax liabilities.
On 26 June 2013, the Basel III legal framework was included in European law through Directive 2013/36 (CRD IV) and Regulation 575/2013 on prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms (CRR), directly applicable in every member State as from 1 January 2014, albeit with a gradual timetable with respect to the application of, and compliance with, various requirements.
This legislation establishes that deferred tax assets, the use of which relies on future profits being obtained, must be deducted from regulatory capital.
In this regard, pursuant to Basel III, in recent years several countries have amended their tax regimes with respect to certain deferred tax assets so that they may continue to be considered regulatory capital since their use does not rely on the future profits of the entities that generate them (referred to hereinafter as 'monetizable tax assets'). Italy had a very similar regime to that described above, which was introduced by Decree-Law no. 225, of 29 December 2010, and amended by Law no. 10, of 26 February 2011. In addition, in 2013 in Brazil, by means of Provisional Measure no. 608, of 28 February 2013, that become Ordinary Law 12838/2013, and, in Spain, through Royal Decree Law 14/2013, of 29 November confirmed by Law 27/2014, of 27 November, tax regimes were established whereby certain deferred tax assets (arising from provisions to allowances for loan losses in Brazil and provisions to allowances for loan losses, provisions to allowances for foreclosed assets and provisions for pension and pre-retirement obligations in Spain) may be converted into tax receivables in specific circumstances. As a result, their use does not rely on the entities obtaining future profits and, accordingly, they are exempt from deduction from regulatory capital.
In 2015 Spain completed its regulations on monetizable tax assets with the introduction of a financial contribution which involves the payment of 1.5% per annum, in order to maintain the right to monetise which applies to the portion of the deferred tax assets that qualify under the legal requirements as monetizable assets generated prior to 2016.
In a similar manner, Italy, by decree of 3 May 2016 has introduced a fee of 1.5% annually to maintain the monetizable of part of the deferred tax assets.

The detail of deferred tax assets, by classification as monetizable or non-monetizable assets, and of deferred tax liabilities at 31 December 2021, 2020 and 2019 is as follows:

Of which:

Valuation of tangible and intangible assets — 3,081 — 2,311 — 1,962. 
Investments in Group companies — 337 — 440 — 831 * Banco Popular Español, S.A.U. considered that part of its monetizable assets were converted into credit against the Tax Administration in 2017 Income Tax return, as the circumstances of the aforementioned regulations were met at the end of that year (EUR 995 million). The Spanish tax authorities have expressly confirmed the nature of these assets as monetizable, but they consider that conditions for conversion are not met at the end of 2017, without prejudice to the conversion in future years. Likewise, Grupo Santander, due to losses incurred in 2020, converted EUR 642 million of monetizable tax assets into credit against the Tax Administration in its Corporate Income Tax return. This tax return is subject to review by the Tax Authorities.
Grupo Santander only recognises deferred tax assets for temporary differences or tax loss and tax credit carryforwards where it is considered probable that the consolidated entities that generated them will have sufficient future taxable profits against which they can be utilised.
The deferred tax assets and liabilities are reassessed at the reporting date in order to ascertain whether any adjustments need to be made on the basis of the findings of the analyses performed.
These analyses take into consideration all evidence, both positive and negative, of the recoverability of such deferred tax assets, among which we can find, (i) the results generated by the different entities in previous years, (ii) the projections of results of each entity or fiscal group, (iii) the estimation of the reversal of the different temporary differences according to their nature and (iv) the period and limits established under the applicable legislation of each country for the recovery of the different deferred tax assets, thus concluding on the ability of each entity or fiscal group to recover the deferred tax assets registered.
The projections of results used in this analysis are based on the financial budgets approved by both the local directions of the corresponding units and by the Group's administrators. The Group's budget estimation process is common for all units. The Group's management prepares its financial budgets based on the following key assumptions: a) Microeconomic variables of the entities that make up the fiscal group in each location: the existing balance structure, the mix of products offered and the commercial strategy at each moment defined by local directions are taken into account, based on the competition, regulatory and market environment.
b) Macroeconomic variables: estimated growths are based on the evolution of the economic environment considering the expected evolution in the gross domestic product of each location, and the forecasts of interest rates, inflation and exchange rates fluctuations. These data is provided by the Group’s Studies Service, based on external sources of information.
Additionally, the Group performs retrospective contrasts (backtesting) on the variables projected in the past. The differential behaviour of these variables with respect to the real market data is considered in the projections estimated in each fiscal year. Thus, and in relation to Spain, the deviations identified by the Directors in recent past years are due to non-recurring events outside the operation of the business, such as the impacts due to the first application of new regulations, the costs assumed for the acceleration of the restructuring plans and the changing effect of the current macroeconomic environment.

During 2020, taking into account the uncertainties about the economic impacts derived from the covid-19 health crisis, the Group reassessed the ability to generate future taxable income in relation to the recoverability of deferred tax assets recorded in the main Group companies. Management considered that the recovery period of these assets would not be affected and that it was not necessary to make adjustments to the deferred tax assets recognised in the Group on the basis of the results of the analyses performed, except in Spain, where the changes in the key assumptions on which the projected results of its tax group are based, arising from the impact of covid-19, resulted in the recognition of an impairment of EUR 2,500 million of deferred tax assets under 'Income Tax' in the income statement.
Finally, and given the degree of uncertainty of these assumption on the referred variables, the Group conducts a sensitivity analysis of the most significant assumptions considered in the deferred tax assets’ recoverability analysis, considering any reasonable change in the key assumptions on which the projections of results of each entity or fiscal group and the estimation of the reversal of the different temporary differences are based.
In relation to Spain, the sensitivity analysis has consisted of adjusting 50 basis points for growth (gross domestic product) and adjusting 50 basis points for inflation. Following the sensitivity analysis performed, the Group estimate that the maximum recovery period of the deferred tax assets recognized as of 31 December 2021 would be 15 years.
Relevant information is set forth below for the main countries which have recognised deferred tax assets:
Spain The deferred tax assets recognised at the Consolidated Tax Group total EUR 9,954 million, of which EUR 7,420 million were for monetizable temporary differences with the right to conversion into a credit against the Public Finance, EUR 1,902 million for other temporary differences and EUR 632 million for tax losses and credits.
The Group estimates that the recognised deferred tax assets for temporary differences will be recovered in a maximum period of 15 years. This period would also apply to the recovery of the recognised tax loss and tax credit carryforwards.
Brazil The deferred tax assets recognised in Brazil total EUR 5,204 million, of which EUR 2,909 million were for monetizable temporary differences, EUR 1,984 million for other temporary differences and EUR 311 million for tax losses and credits.
Grupo Santander estimates that the recognised deferred tax assets for temporary differences, tax losses and credits will be recovered in approximately 10 years.
United States The deferred tax assets recognised in the United States total EUR 1,503 million, of which EUR 1,215 million were for temporary differences and EUR 288 million for tax losses and credits. The Group estimates that the recognised deferred tax assets for temporary differences, tax losses and credits will be recovered in a period of 15 years.

Auditor's Consolidated Notes to the consolidated Contents report financial statements financial statements Appendix f) Tax reforms The following significant tax reforms were approved in 2021 and previous years:
In Spain, Royal Decree-Law 3-2016 was approved in December 2016, which meant the reduction of the limits for the integration of deferred monetizable tax assets and for the set-off of negative tax bases and deductions in order to avoid double taxation as well as the compulsory impairment reversion for deductible participations in previous years in five years, and the non deductibility of the losses generated from the transmission of participations. In 2020 the General State Budget Law for 2021 established, among other tax measures, the non deductibility in Corporation Tax of management fees on participations whose dividends or capital gains are exempt, determining the amount of these expenses as a 5% of the dividends or capital gains. Likewise in 2021 the General State Budget Law for 2022 was approved. This law establishes a minimum effective tax rate of 15% (18% for financial entities) on Corporation Tax base.
In the United Kingdom, in March 2021 it was announced that the main Corporation Tax rate will increase from 1 April 2023 to 25% from 19%. This increase was enacted in Finance Act 2021.
In Brazil, the Constitutional Amendment 103/19 was adopted on 12 November 2019, modifying the social security system, including, among other measures, an increase in the CSLL tax rate for banks from 15% to 20%, effective 1 March 2020. This increase lifted the aggregate tax rate -sum of CSLL and the corporate income tax (Imposto de Renda Pessoa Jurídica; IRPJ)- for banks from 40% to 45%. In addition, in 2021, the provisional measure (Medida Provisoria) 1,034/2021, temporarily increases, from 1 July 2021 to 31 December 2021, the rate of a Social Contribution on the Net Income (CSLL) of the banks to 25% from 20%, and for other financial institutions to 20% from 15%, being the joint taxation for banks 50% (25% IR and 25% CSLL), and 45% for other financial institutions. In the IOF (Tax on financial operations) on credit operations, as of 1 January 2021 the rate of 0,38% (0% for part of 2020) is reinstated, and for settled transactions from 20 September to 31 December 2021, a temporary increase in the IOF rates applicable for credit transactions was approved (annual rate 1.5%% to 2.04%% for legal persons and 3% to 4.8% for natural persons).
In Argentina, Law n.º 27630 (BOE of 16 June 2021) amended, with retroactive effect to 1 January 2021, the rate applicable to the Corporate Income Tax, establishing a progressive rate scale which for Banco Santander Río S.A. represents an increase from 30% to 35%. In addition, the 7% withholding on dividend distribution is maintained (however, the distribution of pre-2018 reserves is not subject to withholding tax). In addition, during the first quarter of the year, there was an increase in the tax on gross income to financial institutions in both, the City of Buenos Aires (from 7% to 8%) and the Province of Buenos Aires (from 7% to 9%). Additionally, the adjustment for tax inflation that was to be applied on a transitional basis in 1/3 of 2019, has been lowered to 1/6 in 2019, with the rest being deferred over the next five years. 
On 27 November 2019 entered into force the Protocol amending the Convention between the United States of America and the kingdom of Spain for the Avoidance of Double Taxation (DTT). The revision of the Convention introduces substantial reductions in the withholding rates that apply to different types of income, highlighting the reduction of the withholding rate on dividends to 5% for shareholdings of more than 10%, the elimination of withholding for shareholdings greater than 80% and elimination of withholding at source on interests and royalties. Build Back Better Act, approved in the House of Representatives on November 19, 2021, includes significant tax increases and measures impacting large corporations and other high-income taxpayers, such as the introduction of a 15% Minimum Tax on Financial Statement Pre-Tax Book Income, changes to the Base Erosion Anti-Abuse Tax and a new excise tax on Share Buy-Backs. Build Back Better Act is pending to be passed by the Senate. 
In Chile, Law n.º 21,210 on modernization of Chilean tax law was enacted in 2020. It includes several modifications to different tax laws in force in Chile. Among the aspects included, it is worth highlighting the substitute tax that on a temporary basis until 30 April 2022 allows taxing at 30% (instead of the generally applicable 35%) with a credit of the first category tax paid, the tax profits generated up to the 31 December 2016, reducing the fiscal cost of its distribution and other measures about asset depreciation and indirect taxes.
On 22 December 2021, the European Commission has proposed a Directive ensuring a minimum effective tax rate for the global activities of large multinational groups. The proposal follows closely the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting and sets out how the principles of the 15% effective tax rate – agreed by 137 countries – will be applied in practice within the European Union (EU). It includes a common set of rules (GloBe Rules) on how to calculate this effective tax rate, so that it is properly and consistently applied across the EU.
g) Other information In compliance with the disclosure requirement established in the listing rules instrument 2005 published by the UK Financial Conduct Authority, it is hereby stated that shareholders of the Bank resident in the United Kingdom will be entitled to a tax credit for taxes paid abroad in respect of withholdings that the Bank has to pay on the dividends to be paid to such shareholders if the total income of the dividend exceeds the amount of exempt dividends of GBP 2,000 for the year 2021/22. The shareholders of the Bank resident in the United Kingdom who hold their ownership interest in the Bank through Santander Nominee Service will be informed directly of the amount thus withheld and of any other data they may require to complete their tax returns in the United Kingdom. The other shareholders of the Bank resident in the United Kingdom should contact their bank or securities broker.
Banco Santander, S.A., is part of the Large Business Forum and has adhered since 2010 to the Code of Good Tax Practices in Spain. Also Santander UK is a member of the HMRC’s Code of Practice on Taxation in the United Kingdom, actively participating in both cases in the cooperative compliance programs being developed by these Tax Administrations.

29. Other comprehensive income. 
The balances of 'Other comprehensive income' include the amounts, net of the related tax effect, of the adjustments to assets and liabilities recognised in equity through the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense. The amounts arising from subsidiaries are presented, on a line by line basis, in the appropriate items according to their nature.
Respect to items that may be reclassified to profit or loss, the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense includes changes in other comprehensive income as follows: • Revaluation gains (losses): includes the amount of the income, net of the expenses incurred in the year, recognised directly in equity. The amounts recognised in equity in the year remain under this item, even if in the same year they are transferred to the income statement or to the initial carrying amount of the assets or liabilities or are reclassified to another line item.
• Amounts transferred to income statement: includes the amount of the revaluation gains and losses previously recognised in equity, even in the same year, which are recognised in the income statement.
• Amounts transferred to initial carrying amount of hedged items: includes the amount of the revaluation gains and losses previously recognised in equity, even in the same year, which are recognised in the initial carrying amount of assets or liabilities as a result of cash flow hedges.
• Other reclassifications: includes the amount of the transfers made in the year between the various valuation adjustment items.

Since the entry into force of IFRS 9, the Group estimates the expected losses on debt instruments measured at fair value with changes in other comprehensive income. These losses are recorded with a charge to the consolidated income statement for the period.
At the end of the years 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Group recorded under 'Impairment or reversal of impairment on financial assets not measured at fair value through profit or loss', net due to modification of the consolidated income statement, in the line of financial assets at fair value with changes in other comprehensive income a provision of EUR 19 million, EUR 19 million and EUR 12 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Zurich Santander Insurance América, S.L. (332) (298) (171) 30. Shareholders’ equity. 
The changes in Shareholders' equity are presented in the consolidated statement of changes in total equity. Significant information on certain items of Shareholders' equity and the changes during the year are set forth below.
31. Issued capital a) Changes At 31 December 2018, Banco Santander’s share capital consisted of 16,236,573,942 shares with a total par value of EUR 8,118 million.
On 10 September 2019, a capital increase of EUR 191 million was carried out with the issuance of 381,540,640 shares (2.35% of the Bank's share capital), to meet the takeover bid for 16.69% of the share capital of Banco Santander México, S.A., Institución de Banca Múltiple, Grupo Financiero Santander México. (see Note 3.a).
Therefore, Banco Santander’s new capital consisted of EUR 8,309 million at 31 December 2019, represented by 16,618,114,582 shares of EUR 0.50 of nominal value each one and all of them from a unique class and series.
On 3 December 2020, a capital increase of EUR 361 million was made, with a charge to the share premium, through the issue of 722,526,720 shares (4.35% of the share capital).
Therefore, Banco Santander's share capital at 31 December 2020 consisted of EUR 8,670 million, represented by 17,340,641,302 shares of EUR 0.50 of nominal value each and all of them of a unique class and series.
Equally, Banco Santander's share capital at 31 December 2021 consisted of EUR 8,670 million, represented by 17,340,641,302 shares of EUR 0.50 of nominal value each and all of them of a unique class and series. Includes 259,930,273 shares corresponding to the first share repurchase program for which it has been agreed (together with the shares that are finally to be acquired under the second share repurchase program) to submit their redemption to the general shareholders meeting subject to the pertinent regulatory authorizations (see notes 4 and 34).
Banco Santander’s shares are listed on the Spanish Stock Market Interconnection System and on the New York, London, Mexico and Warsaw Stock Exchanges, and all of them have the same features and rights. Santander shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange under Crest Depository Interest (CDI), each CDI representing one Bank’s share. They are also listed on the New York Stock Exchange under American Depositary Receipts (BDR), each BDR representing one share. During 2019 and 2018 the number of markets where the Bank is listed was reduced; the Bank's shares was delisted from Buenos Aires, Milan, Lisboa and São Paulo's markets.
At 31 December 2021, no shareholder held more than 3% of Banco Santander’s total share capital (which is the threshold generally provided under Spanish regulations for a significant holding in a listed company to be disclosed). Even though at 31 December 2021, certain custodians appeared in our shareholder registry as holding more than 3% of our share capital, we understand that those shares were held in custody on behalf of other investors, none of whom exceeded that threshold individually. These custodians were State Street Bank (13.35%), Chase Nominees Limited (9.15%), The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (5.21%), Citibank New York (3.74%) and EC Nominees Limited (3.34%).
On 24 October 2019, BlackRock Inc. reported to the CNMV its significant holding of voting rights in Banco Santander (5.426%). It also specified that it was holding shares on behalf of a number of funds or other investment entities, none of which exceeded 3% individually. No changes have been communicated since then. There may be some overlap in the holdings declared by the above mentioned custodians and asset manager.
At 31 December 2021, neither Banco Santander's shareholder registry nor the CNMV's registry showed any shareholder residing in a non-cooperative jurisdiction with a shareholding equal to, or greater than, 1% of our share capital (which is the other threshold applicable under Spanish regulations).
b) Other considerations. 
Under Spanish law, only shareholders at the general meeting have the authority to increase share capital. However, they may delegate the authority to approve or execute capital increases to the board of directors. Banco Santander´s Bylaws are fully aligned with Spanish law and do not establish any different conditions for share capital increases.
At 31 December 2021 the shares of the following companies were listed on official stock markets: Banco Santander Río S.A.; Banco Santander México, S.A., Institución de Banca Múltiple, Grupo Financiero Santander México; Banco Santander - Chile; Banco Santander (Brasil) S.A., Santander Bank Polska S.A. (former Bank Zachodni WBK S.A.) and Santander Consumer USA Holdings Inc. and Getnet Adquirência e Serviços para Meios de Pagamento S.A.

Auditor's Consolidated Notes to the consolidated Contents report financial statements financial statements Appendix. 
At 31 December 2021 the number of Banco Santander shares owned by third parties and managed by Group management companies (mainly portfolio, collective investment undertaking and pension fund managers) or jointly managed was 45 million shares, which represented 0.26% of Banco Santander’s share capital (39 and 40 million shares, representing 0.22% and 0.24% of the share capital in 2020 and 2019, respectively). In addition, the number of Banco Santander shares owned by third parties and received as security was 231 million shares (equal to 1.33% of the Bank’s share capital).
At 31 December 2021 the capital increases in progress at Group companies and the additional capital authorised by their shareholders at the respective general meetings were not material at Group level (see appendix V).
32. Share premium. 
Share premium includes the amount paid up by the Bank’s shareholders in capital issues in excess of the par value.
The Corporate Enterprises Act expressly permits the use of the share premium account balance to increase capital at the entities at which it is recognised and does not establish any specific restrictions as to its use.
The change in the balance of share premium corresponds to the capital increases detailed in note 31.a).
The increased produced in 2019 was a consequence of the increase of EUR 1,491 million to cope with the capital increase for the acquisition of Banco Santander México, S.A, Institución de Banca Múltiple, Grupo Financiero Santander México shares on 10 September 2019.
The decrease in 2020 was due to the reduction of EUR 361 million to cover the capital increase on 3 December (see note 31).
The decreased produced in 2021 for an amount of EUR 4,034 million has been the consequence of applying the result obtained by Banco Santander during the financial year 2020, consisting of losses of EUR 3,557 million, as reflected in the consolidated statements of changes in total equity, and the charge of the dividend for the fiscal year 2020 for an amount of EUR 477 million (see note 4.a and consolidated statements of changes in total equity).
Also, in 2020 and 2019 an amount of EUR 72 million and EUR 38 million, respectively, were transferred from the Share premium account to the Legal reserve (see note 33.b.i).
33. Accumulated retained earnings a) Definitions The balance of 'Equity - Accumulated gains and Other reserves' includes the net amount of the accumulated results (profits or losses) recognised in previous years through the consolidated income statement which in the profit distribution were allocated in equity, the expenses of own equity instrument issues, the differences between the amount for which the treasury shares are sold and their acquisition price, as well as the net amount of the results accumulated in previous years, generated by the result of noncurrent assets held for sale, recognised through the consolidated income statement.
b) Breakdown The detail of Accumulated retained earnings and Reserves of entities accounted for using the equity method is as follows:
EUR million 2021 2020 2019. 
Restricted reserves 2,543 2,460 2,595. 
Legal reserve 1,734 1,734 1,662. 
Own shares 755 672 879. 
Revaluation reserve Royal Decree-Law 7/1996 43 43 43. 
Reserve for retired capital 11 11 11. 
Unrestricted reserves 4,243 10,422 10,664. 
Voluntary reserves* 6,123 6,128 4,603. 
Consolidation reserves attributable to the Bank (1,880) 4,294 6,061. 
Reserves of subsidiaries 47,438 47,601 43,449. 
Reserves of entities accounted for using the equity method 1,572 1,504 1,210 55,796 61,987 57,918 * In accordance with the commercial regulations in force in Spain.
i. Legal reserve Under the Consolidated Spanish Corporate Enterprises Act, 10% of net profit for each year must be transferred to the legal reserve. These transfers must be made until the balance of this reserve reaches 20% of the share capital. The legal reserve can be used to increase capital provided that the remaining reserve balance does not fall below 10% of the increased share capital amount.
In 2020 and 2019, Banco Santander transferred EUR 72 million and EUR 38 million, respectively, from the Share premium account to the Legal reserve.
Consequently, once again, after the capital increases described in note 31 had been carried out, the balance of the legal reserve reached 20% of the share capital, and at 31 December 2021 the Legal reserve was of the stipulated level.
ii. Reserve for treasury shares According to the Consolidated Text of the Corporate Enterprises Act, an unavailable reserve equivalent to the amount for which Banco Santander's shares owned by subsidiaries are recorded. This reservation shall be freely available when the circumstances which have obliged its constitution disappear. In addition, this reserve covers the outstanding balance of loans granted by the Group with Banco Santander's share guarantee and the amount equivalent to the credits granted by the Group companies to third parties for the acquisition of own shares.
iii. Revaluation reserve Royal Decree Law 7/1996, of 7 June The balance of Revaluation reserve Royal Decree-Law 7/1996 can be used, free of tax, to increase share capital. From 1 January 2007, the balance of this account can be taken to unrestricted reserves, provided that the monetary surplus has been realised. The surplus will be deemed to have been realised in respect of the portion on which depreciation has been taken for accounting purposes or when the revalued assets have been transferred or derecognised.
If the balance of this reserve were used in a manner other than that provided for in Royal Decree law 7/1996, of 7 June, it would be subject to taxation.

Hed 36. ging derivatives. 
Grupo Santander, within its financial risk management strategy, and in order to reduce asymmetries in the accounting treatment of its operations, enters into hedging derivatives on interest, exchange rate, credit risk or variation of stock prices, depending on the nature of the risk covered.
Based on its objective, Grupo Santander classifies its hedges in the following categories: • Cash flow hedges: cover the exposure to the variation of the cash flows associated with an asset, liability or a highly probable forecast transaction. This cover the variable-rate issues in foreign currencies, fixed-rate issues in non-local currency, variable-rate interbank financing and variable-rate assets (bonds, commercial loans, mortgages, etc.).
• Fair value hedges: cover the exposure to the variation in the fair value of assets or liabilities, attributable to an identified and hedged risk. This covers the interest risk of assets or liabilities (bonds, loans, bills, issues, deposits, etc.) with coupons or fixed interest rates, interests in entities, issues in foreign currencies and deposits or other fixed rate liabilities.
• Hedging of net investments abroad: cover the exchange rate risk of the investments in subsidiaries domiciled in a country with a different currency from the functional one of the Group.
Due to the replacement of the current rates by the alternative rates defined in the note 1 of this report, in the section 'Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 9 and IFRS 7 on reference interest rates (IBOR Reform Phase I and II)',the nominal amount of hedging instruments corresponding to the hedging relationships directly affected by the uncertainties related to the IBOR reforms is shown below.

Auditor's Consolidated Notes to the consolidated Contents report financial statements financial statements Appendix. 
Considering the main entities or groups within the Group by the weight of their hedging, the main types of hedging that are being carried out in Santander UK Group Holdings plc group and Banco Santander, S.A.
Santander UK Group Holdings plc group enters into fair value and cash flow hedging derivatives depending on the exposure of the underlying. Only designated risks are hedged and therefore other risks, such as credit risk, are managed but not hedged.
Within fair value hedges, Santander UK Group Holdings plc group has portfolios of assets and liabilities at fixed rate that are exposed to changes in fair value due to changes in market interest rates. These positions are managed by contracting mainly interest rate swaps. Effectiveness is assessed by comparing the changes in the fair value of these portfolios generated by the hedged risk with the changes in the fair value of the derivatives contracted.
Santander UK Group Holdings plc group also has access to international markets to obtain financing by issuing fixed-rate debt in its functional currency and other currencies. As such, they are exposed to changes in interest rates and exchange rates, mainly in EUR and USD. This risk is mitigated with cross currency swaps e interest rate swaps in which they pay a fixed rate and receive a variable rate. Effectiveness is evaluated using linear regression techniques to compare changes in the fair value of the debt at interest and exchange rates with changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps o loss cross currency swaps.
Within the cash flow hedges, Santander UK Group Holdings plc group has portfolios of assets and liabilities at variable rates, normally at SONIA or LIBOR. To mitigate this market rate variability risk, it contracts interest rate swaps.
As Santander UK Group Holdings plc group obtains financing in the international markets, it assumes a significant exposure to currency risk mainly USD and EUR. In addition, it also holds debt securities for liquidity purposes which assume exposure mainly in JPY. To manage this exchange rate risk, spot, forward y cross currency swap are contracted to match the cash flow profile and the maturity of the estimated interest and principal repayments of the hedged item.
Effectiveness is assessed by comparing changes in the fair value of the derivatives with changes in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk by applying a hypothetical derivative method using linear regression techniques.
In addition, within the hedges that cover equity risk, Santander UK Group Holdings plc group offers employees the opportunity to purchase shares of the Bank at a discount under the sharesave scheme, exposing the Bank to share price risk. As such, options are purchased allowing them to purchase shares at a pre-set price.
Banco Santander, S.A. covers the risks of its balance sheet in a variety of ways. On the one hand, documented as fair value hedges, it covers the interest rate, foreign currency and credit risk of fixed-income portfolios at a fixed rate (REPOs are included in this category). Resulting, in an exposure to changes in their fair value due to variations in market conditions based on the various risks hedged, which has an impact on Banco Santander's income statement. To mitigate these risks, Banco Santander contracts derivatives, mainly interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps, cap&floors, forex forward y credit default swaps.
On the other hand, the interest and exchange rate risk of loans granted to corporate clients at a fixed rate is generally covered. These hedges, are carried out through interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps and exchange rate derivatives (forex swaps and forex forward).
In addition, Banco Santander, S.A. manages the interest and exchange risk of debt issues in its various categories (issuing covered bonds, perpetual, subordinated and senior bond) and in different currencies, denominated at fixed rates, and therefore subject to changes in their fair value. These issues are covered through interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps or a mix of both by applying differentiated fair value hedging strategies for interest rate risk and cash flow hedging strategies to hedge foreign exchange risk.
The methodology used by Banco Santander, S.A. to measure the effectiveness of fair value hedges is based on comparing the market values of the hedged items (based on the objective risk of the hedge) and of the hedging instruments in order to analyse whether the changes in the market value of the hedged items are offset by the market value of the hedging instruments, thereby mitigating the hedged risk and minimizing volatility in the income statement. Prospectively, the same analysis is performed, measuring the theoretical market values in the event of parallel variations in the market curves of a positive basis point.
There is a macro hedge of structured loans in which the interest rate risk of fixed-rate loans (mortgage, personal or with other guarantees) granted to legal entities in commercial or corporate banking and wealth clients in the medium-long term is hedged. This hedge is instrumented as a macro hedge of fair value, the main hedging instruments being interest rate swap and cap&floors. In case of total or partial cancellation or early repayment, the customer is obliged to pay/receive the cost/income of the cancellation of the interest rate risk hedge managed by the Bank.
Regarding cash flow hedges, the objective is to hedge the cash flow exposure to changes in interest rates and exchange rates.
For retrospective purposes, the hypothetical derivative methodology is used to measure effectiveness. By means of this methodology, the hedged risk is modelled as a derivative instrument -not real-, created exclusively for the purpose of measuring the effectiveness of the hedge, and which must comply with the fact that its main characteristics coincide with the critical terms of the hedged item throughout the period for which the hedging relationship is designated. This hypothetical derivative does not incorporate characteristics that are exclusive to the hedging instrument. Additionally, it is worth mentioning that any risk component not associated with the hedged objective risk and effectively documented at the beginning of the hedge is excluded for the purpose of calculating the effectiveness. The market value of the hypothetical derivative that replicates the hedged item is compared with the market value of the hedging instrument, verifying that the hedged risk is effectively mitigated and that the impact on the income statement due to potential ineffectiveness is residual.
Prospectively, the variations in the market values of the hedging instrument and the hedged item (represented by the hypothetical derivative) are measured in the event of parallel shifts of a positive basis point in the affected market curves.

Auditor's Consolidated Notes to the consolidated Contents report financial statements financial statements Appendix. 
There is another macro-hedge, this time of cash flows, the purpose of which is to actively manage the risk-free interest rate risk (excluding credit risk) of a portion of the floating rate assets of Banco Santander, S.A., through the arrangement of interest rate derivatives whereby the bank exchanges floating rate interest flows for others at a fixed rate agreed at the time the transactions are arranged. The items affected by the Macro-hedging have been designated as those in which their cash flows are exposed to interest rate risk, specifically the floating rate mortgages of the Banco Santander, S.A. network referenced to Euribor 12 Months or Euribor Mortgage, with annual renewal of rates, classified as sound risk and which do not have a contractual floor (or, if not, this floor is not activated). The hedged position affecting the Macro Cash Flow Hedge at the present time is EUR 7,000 million.
Regarding net foreign investments hedges, basically, they are allocated in Banco Santander, S.A. and Santander Consumer Finance Group. Grupo Santander assumes as a priority risk management objective to minimize -to the limit determined by the Group's Financial Management- the impact on the calculation of the capital ratio of its permanent investments included within the Group's consolidation perimeter, and whose shares or equity interests are legally denominated in a currency other than that of the Group's parent company. For this purpose, financial instruments (generally derivatives) are contracted to hedge the impact on the capital ratio of changes in forward exchange rates. Grupo Santander mainly hedges the risk for the following currencies: BRL, CLP, MXN, CAD, COP, CNY, GBP, CHF, NOK, USD, and PLN. The instruments used to hedge the risk of these investments are forex swaps, forex forward and spot currency purchases/sales.
For this type of hedges, ineffectiveness scenarios are considered to be of low probability, given that the hedging instrument is designated considering the position determined and the spot rate at which the position is located.

Other geographies Consumer Group entities mainly have loans portfolios at fixed interest rates and are therefore, exposed to changes in fair value due to movements in market interest rates. The entities manage this risk by contracting interest rate swaps in which they pay a fixed rate and receive a variable rate. Interest rate risk is the only one hedged and, therefore, other risks, such as credit risk, are managed but not hedged by the entities. The interest rate risk component is determined as the change in fair value of fixed rate loans arising solely from changes in a reference rate. This strategy is designated as a fair value hedge and its effectiveness is assessed by comparing changes in the fair value of loans attributable to changes in reference interest rates with changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps.
In addition, in order to access international markets with the aim of obtaining sources of financing, some Consumer Group´s entities issue fixed rate debt in their own currency and in other currencies that differ from their functional currency. Therefore, they are exposed to changes in both interest rates and exchange rates, which they mitigate with derivatives (interest rate swaps, fx forward and cross currency swaps) in which they receive a fixed interest rate and pay a variable interest rate, implemented with a fair value hedge.
The cash flow hedges of the Santander Group´s entities hedge the foreign currency risk of loans and financing.
Finally, it has hedges of net investments abroad to hedge the foreign exchange risk of the shareholding in NOK and CNY currencies.
Banco Santander México, S.A., Institución de Banca Múltiple, Grupo Financiero Santander México has mainly long-term loan portfolios at fixed interest rates, portfolios of short-term deposits in local currency, portfolios of Mexican Government bonds and corporate bonds in currencies other than the local currency and are therefore exposed to changes in fair value due to movements in market interest rates, as well as these latter portfolios also to variations in exchange rates. The entity manages this risk by contracting derivatives (interest rate swaps or cross currency swaps) in which they pay a fixed rate and receive a variable rate. Only the interest rate and exchange rate risk is hedged, if applicable, and therefore other risks, such as credit risk, are managed but not hedged by the entity.
The interest rate risk component is determined as the change in the fair value of fixed rate loans arising solely from changes in a reference rate. This strategy is designated as a fair value hedge and its effectiveness is assessed by comparing changes in the fair value of loans attributable to changes in benchmark interest rates with changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps.
Regarding cash flow hedges, Banco Santander México, S.A., Institución de Banca Múltiple, Grupo Financiero Santander México has a portfolio of unsecured bonds issued at a variable rate in its local currency, which it manages with an Interest Rate Swap in which it receives a variable rate and pays a fixed rate. On the other hand, it also has different items in currencies other than the local currency: unsecured fixed rate bonds, commercial bank loans at variable rates, fixed rate issues, Mexican and Brazilian government bonds at fixed rates. In all these portfolios, the Bank is exposed to exchange rate variations, which it mitigates by contracting cross currency swaps or fx forward.

Banco Santander (Brasil) S.A. has, on the one hand, fixed-rate government bond portfolios and, therefore, they are exposed to changes in fair value due to movements in market interest rates. The entity manages this risk by contracting derivatives (interest rate swaps or futures) in which they pay a fixed rate and receive a variable rate. The interest rate risk is the only one hedged and consequently other risks, such as credit risk, are managed but not hedged by the entity. This strategy is designated as a fair value hedge and its effectiveness is evaluated by comparing by linear regression the changes in the fair value of the bonds with the changes in the fair value of the derivatives.
On the other hand, as part of the fair value hedge strategy, it has corporate loans in different currencies than the local one and is therefore exposed to changes in fair value due to exchange rates. This risk is mitigated by contracting cross currency swaps. Its effectiveness is evaluated by comparing changes in the fair value of loans attributable to changes subject of hedge with changes in the fair value of derivatives.
Finally, it also holds a portfolio of long-term corporate bonds with inflation-indexed rates, thus exposed to changes in market value due to changes in market inflation rates. In order to achieve its mitigation, they contract futures in which they pay the indexed inflation and receive variable interest rates. Its effectiveness is assessed by comparing through lineal regression the changes in the fair value of the bonds to the changes in fair value of the derivatives.
In the hedge of cash flows, Banco Santander (Brasil) S.A. has portfolios of loans and government bonds in different currency than the entity's functional currency and, therefore, it is subject to the risk of changes in currency rates. This exposure will be mitigated by hiring cross currency swaps and futures. Its effectiveness is assessed by comparing changes in fair value of loans and bonds, caused by the hedge risk, to changes in fair value of such derivatives.
Finally, they have a portfolio of variable rate government bonds, so they are exposed to changes in the value due to changes in interest rates. In order to mitigate these changes, a future is hired in which a variable rate is paid and a fixed rate is received. Its effectiveness is assessed by comparing changes in the fair value loans and bonds to changes in the fair value of the futures.

Derivatives 54,292 67,137 63,397 138,446 168,148 175,210. 
Grupo Santander mitigates and reduces this exposure as follows: • With respect to derivatives, the Group has entered into framework agreements with a large number of credit institutions and customers for the netting-off of asset positions and the provision of collateral for non-payment.
At 31 December 2021 the exposure to credit risk of the derivatives presented in the balance sheet is not significant because they are subject to netting and collateral agreements (see note 2.f).
• Loans and advances to credit institutions and Loans and advances includes reverse repos amounting to EUR 26,060 million at 31 December 2021.
Also, mortgage-backed assets totalled EUR 1,299 million.
• Debt instruments include EUR 24,117 million of Spanish and foreign government securities.
At 31 December 2021 the amount of the change in the year in the fair value of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss attributable to variations in their credit risk (spread) was not material.
The detail of the amount of the liability balances is as follows:

At 31 December 2021, the amount of the change in the fair value of financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss attributable to changes in their credit risk during the year is not material.
In relation to liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss where it has been determined at initial recognition that the credit risk is recorded in accumulated 'Other comprehensive income' (see 'Statement of recognised income and expense') the amount that the Group would be contractually obliged to pay on maturity of these liabilities at 31 December 2021 is EUR 81 million lower than their carrying amount (EUR 119 million at 31 December 2020 and EUR 26 million at 31 December 2019).
Within Deposits, there are repurchase agreements amounting to EUR 14,057 million at 31 December 2021.
44. Exchange differences, net. 
Exchange differences shows basically the gains or losses on currency dealings, the differences that arise on translations of monetary items in foreign currencies to the functional currency.
Grupo Santander manages the currencies to which it is exposed together with the arrangement of derivative instruments and, accordingly, the changes in this line item should be analysed together with those recognised under 'Gains/losses on financial assets and liabilities' (see note 43).

Deferred variable remuneration systems Description and plan beneficiaries Conditions Calculation Base (ii)Deferred Multiyear Objectives Variable Remuneration Plan (2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021)
The aim is simplifying the remuneration structure, improving the ex ante risk adjustment and increasing the impact of the longterm objectives on the Group’s most relevant roles. The purpose of these cycles is to defer a portion of the variable remuneration of the beneficiaries over a period of three or five years, for it to be paid, where appropriate, in cash and in Santander shares; the other portion of the variable remuneration is also to be paid in cash and Santander shares, upon commencement of the cycles, in accordance with the rules set forth below. The accrual of the last third of the deferral (in the case of 3 years deferral) of the last three fifths (in the case of 5 years deferral) is also subject to long-term objectives.
Beneficiaries Executive directors, senior managers and certain executives of the Group’s first lines of responsibility.
In 2016 the accrual is conditioned, in addition to the permanence of the beneficiary in the Group, with the exceptions contained in the plan’s regulations that none of The following circumstances during the period prior to each of the deliveries in the terms set forth in each case in the plan’s regulations: i.

Significant failures in risk management committed by the entity, or by a business unit or risk control unit. vi. the increase suffered by the entity or by a business unit of its capital needs, not foreseen at the time of generation of the exposures. vii. Regulatory sanctions or court rulings for events that could be attributable to the unit or the personnel responsible for those. Also, the breach of internal codes of conduct of the entity. viii. Irregular behaviours, whether individual or collective, considering in particular negative effects derived from the marketing of inappropriate products and responsibilities of persons or bodies that made those decisions. Paid half in cash and half in shares. The maximum number of shares to be delivered is calculated by taking into account the weighted average daily volume of weighted average prices for the fifteen trading sessions prior to the previous Friday (excluding) on the date on which the board decides the bonus for the Executive directors of the Bank.
First cycle (2016): • Executive directors and members of the Identified Staff with total variable remuneration higher than or equal to 2.7 million euros: 40% paid immediately and 60% deferred over a 5 years period. • Senior managers, country heads of countries representing at least 1% of the Group´s capital and other members of the identified staff whose total variable remuneration is between 1.7 million and 2.7 million euros: 50% paid immediately and 50% deferred over a 5 years period. • Other beneficiaries: 60% paid immediately and 40% deferred over a 3 years period.

In 2016 the metrics for the deferred portion subject to long-term objectives (last third or last three fifths, respectively, for the cases of three years and five years deferrals) are: • Earnings per share (EPS) growth in 2018 over 2015. • Relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) in the 2016-2018 period measured against a group of credit institutions. • Compliance with the fully-loaded common equity tier 1 (“CET1”) ratio target for financial year 2018. • Compliance with Santander Group’s underlying return on risk-weighted assets (“RoRWA”) growth target for financial year 2018 compared to financial year 2015.
In the second, third, fourth fifth and sixth cycle (2017, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021) the metrics for the deferred portion subject to long-term objectives (last third or last three fifths, respectively, for the cases of three years and five years deferrals) are: • EPS growth in 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023 (over 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020, for each respective cycle) • Relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) measured against a group of 17 credit institutions (second and third cycles) in the periods 2017-2019 and 2018-2019, respectively, and against a group of 9 entities (fourth, fifth and sixth cycle) for the 2019-2021, 2020-2022 and 2010-2023 period. • Compliance with the fully-loaded common equity tier 1 (“CET1”) ratio target for financial years 2019, 2020, 2021,2022 and 2023, respectively.

Deferred variable remuneration systems Description and plan beneficiaries Conditions Calculation Base (iii) Digital Transformation Award (2019, 2020 and 2021)
The 2019, 2020 and 2021 Digital Transformation Incentive (the “Digital Incentive”) is a variable remuneration system that includes the delivery of Santander shares and share options.
The aim of the Digital Incentive is to attract and retain the critical skill sets to support and accelerate the digital transformation of the Group. By means of this program, the Group offers a remuneration element which is competitive with the remuneration systems offered by other market operators who also compete for digital talent.
The number of beneficiaries is limited to a maximum of 250 employees and the total amount of the incentive is limited to 30 million euros.
The funding of this incentive is subject to meeting important milestones that are aligned with the Group´s digital roadmap and have been approved by the board of directors, taking into account the digitalization strategy of the Group, with the aim of becoming the best open, responsible global financial services platform.
Performance of incentive shall be measured based on achievement of the following milestones: 1. Launch of a Global Trade Services (GTS) platform. 2. Launch of a Global Merchant Services (GMS) platform. 3. Migration of our fully digital bank, OpenBank, to a "next generation" platform and launch in 3 markets. 4. Extension of SuperDigital in Brazil to at least one other country. 5. Launch of our international payments app based on blockchain Pago FX to non-Santander customers.
The milestones for the 2020 Digital Transformation Award were: (i) rolling out the global merchant services (GMS) platform in 3 new geographies, enhancing the platform functionality and achieving volume targets for transactions and participating merchants; (ii) doing the commercial rollout of the global trade services (GTS) platform in 8 new geographies, enhancing platform functionality, and achieving volume targets for onboarded clients and monthly active users; (iii) launching OpenBank in a new market and migrating the retail banking infrastructure to “new-mode” bank; (iv) launch the global platform SuperDigital in at least 4 countries, driving target active user growth; (v) deploying machine learning across pre-defined markets for 4 priority use cases, rolling out Conversion Rate Optimization (Digital marketing) for at least 40 sales programs, delivering profit targets, and driving reduction of agent handled calls in contact centers; (vi) successfully implementing initiatives related to on-board and identity services, common API (application programming interface) layer, payment hubs, mobile app for SMEs and virtual assistant services; and (vii) launching the PagoFX global platform in at least 4 countries.
The milestones for 2021 are: (i)in relation to Pago Nxt Consumer payment platform: implementation of Superdigital platform in seven countries, acquisition of over 1.5 million active customer base and accelerating growth through B2B (business to business) and B2B2C (business to business to customer) partnerships, acquiring more than 50% of the new customers through these channels, which are more cost-effective; (ii)in relation to Digital Consumer Bank: launching online API for checkout lending in the European Union and completion of controllable items for Openbank launch in USA; (iii)in relation to One Santander strategy: implementation in Europe of One Common Mobile Experience and, specifically, implementation of Europe ONE app for individual customers in at least three of the four countries by December 2021; and be among the three-top rated entities in terms of Mobile NetPromoter Score (Mobile NPS) in at least two of the four countries by December 2021; (iv) In relation to cloud adoption: host 75% of migratable virtual machines on cloud technology (either public cloud or OHE) by December 2021. For these purposes, mainframes, physical servers and servers with non-x86 operating systems will be considered non-migratable.
The Digital Incentive is structured 50% in Santander shares and 50% in options over Santander shares, taking into account the fair value of the option at the moment in which they are granted. For Material Risk Takers subject to five years deferrals, the Digital Incentive (shares and options over shares) shall be delivered in thirds, on the third, fourth and fifth anniversary from their granting. For Material Risk Takers subject to three years deferrals and employees not subject to deferrals, delivery shall be done on the third anniversary from their granting.
Any delivery of shares, either directly or via exercise of options overs shares, will be subject generally to the Group’s general malus & clawback provisions as described in the Group’s remuneration policy and to the continuity of the beneficiary within the Santander Group. In this regard, the board may define specific rules for non-Identified Staff.
Vested share options can be exercised until maturity, with all options lapsing after ten years (for granting the 2019 incentive) and eight years (for granting the 2020 and 2021 incentive).
The total achievement for 2021 Digital Incentive was 77.5% (85% en 2020 and 83% en 2019).

In 2008 the Group launched a voluntary savings scheme for Santander UK employees (Sharesave Scheme) whereby employees who join the scheme see deducted between GBP 5 and GBP 500 from their net monthly pay over a period of three or five years. At the end of the chosen period, the employee may choose between collecting the amount contributed, the interest accrued and a bonus (taxexempt in the United Kingdom) or exercising options on shares of the Bank in an amount equal to the sum of such three amounts at a fixed price. The exercise price will be the result of reducing by up to 20% the average purchase and sale prices of the Bank shares in the three trading sessions prior to the approval of the scheme by the UK tax authorities (HMRC). This approval must be received within 21to 41 days following the publication of the Group’s results for the first half of the year. This scheme was approved by the Board of Directors, at the proposal of the appointments and remuneration committee, and, since it involved the delivery of Bank shares, its application was authorized by the Annual General Meeting held on June 21, 2008. Also, the scheme was authorized by the UK tax authorities (HMRC) and commenced in September 2008. In subsequent years, at the Annual General Meetings held on June 19, 2009, June 11, 2010, June 17, 2011, March 30, 2012, March 22, 2013, March 28, 2014, March 27, 2015, March 18, 2016, April 7, 2017, March 23, 2018, April 12, 2019, April 3, 2020 and March 26, 2021, respectively, the shareholders approved the application of schemes previously approved by the board and with similar features to the scheme approved in 2008.
iii. Fair value. 
The fair value of the performance share plans was calculated as follows: a) Deferred variable compensation plan linked to multi-year objectives 2019, 2020 and 2021: The Group calculates at the grant date the fair value of the plan based on the valuation report of an independent expert, Willis Towers Watson. According to the design of the plan for 2019, 2020 and 2021 and the levels of achievement of similar plans in comparable entities, the expert concludes that the reasonable range for estimating the initial achievement ratio is around 60%-80%. It has been considered that the fair value is 70% of the maximum.
b) Santander UK sharesave plans: The fair value of each option at the date of grant is estimated using an analytical model that also reflects the correlation between EUR and GBP. This model uses assumptions on the share price, the EUR/ GBP FX rate, the EUR/GBP risk-free interest rate, dividend yields, the expected volatilities of both the underlying shares and EUR/GBP for the expected lives of options granted. The weighted average grantdate fair value of options granted during the year was GBP 0.20 (GBP 0.21 and GBP 0.49 reported in 2020 and 2019, respectively).

The main valuation methods and inputs used in the estimates at 31 December 2021 of the fair values of the financial assets and liabilities in the foregoing table were as follows: • Financial assets at amortised cost: the fair value was estimated using the present value method. The estimates were made considering factors such as the expected maturity of the portfolio, market interest rates, spreads on newly approved transactions or market spreads -when available-.
• Financial liabilities at amortised cost: i) Deposits: the fair value of short term deposits was taken to be their carrying amount. Factors such as the expected maturity of the transactions and the Group’s current cost of funding in similar transactions are consider for the estimation of long term deposits fair value. It had been used also current rates offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities.
ii) Marketable debt securities and subordinated liabilities: the fair value was calculated based on market prices for these instruments -when available- or by the present value method using market interest rates and spreads, as well as using any significant input which is not observable with market data if applicable.
iii) The fair value of cash, cash balances at central banks and other deposits on demand was taken to be their carrying amount since they are mainly short-term balances.
51. Primary and secondary segments reporting. 
Grupo Santander bases segment reporting on financial information presented to the chief operating decision maker, which excludes certain statutory results items that distort year-on-year comparisons and are not considered for management reporting. This financial information (underlying basis) is computed by adjusting reported results for the effects of certain gains and losses (e.g. capital gains, write-downs, impairment of goodwill, etc.). These gains and losses are items that management and investors ordinarily identify and consider separately to better understand the underlying trends in the business.
Grupo Santander has aligned the information in this note with the underlying information used internally for management reporting and with that presented in Grupo Santander's other public documents.
Grupo Santander executive committee has been determined to be its chief operating decision maker. Grupo Santander's operating segments reflect its organizational and managerial structures. Grupo Santander 's executive committee reviews internal reporting based on these segments to assess performance and allocate resources.
The segments are split by geographic area in which profits are earned and type of business. Grupo Santander prepares the information by aggregating the figures for Grupo Santander’s various geographic areas and business units, relating it to both the accounting data of the units integrated in each segment and that provided by management information systems. The same general principles as those used in Grupo Santander are applied.
On 9 April 2021, Grupo Santander announced that, starting and effective with the financial information for the first quarter of 2021, Grupo Santander would carry out a change in the reportable segments to reflect our new organizational and management structure.
These changes in the reportable segments aim to align the segment information with their management and have no impact on the group’s accounting figures.
The main changes, which have been applied to management information for all periods included in the consolidated financial statements, are the following: 1. Primary segments – Creation of the new Digital Consumer Bank (DCB) segment, which includes: • Santander Consumer Finance (SCF), previously included in the Europe segment, and the consumer finance business in the United Kingdom, previously recorded in the country.

Auditor's Consolidated Notes to the consolidated Contents report financial statements financial statements Appendix • Grupo Santander fully digital bank Openbank and the Open Digital Services (ODS) platform, which were previously included in the Santander Global Platform segment.
– Santander Global Platform (SGP), which incorporated our global digital services under a single unit, is no longer a primary segment. Its activities have been distributed as follows: • Openbank and Open Digital Services (ODS), which, as mentioned above, are now included under the new Digital Consumer Bank reporting segment.
• The business recorded in Global Payment Services (Merchant Solutions -GMS-, Trade Solutions -GTS- and Consumer Solutions -Superdigital and Pago FX-) has been allocated to the three main geographic segments, Europe, North America and South America, with no impact on the information reported for each country.
2. Secondary segments – Creation of the PagoNxt segment, which incorporates simple and accessible digital payment solutions to drive customer loyalty and allows us to combine our most disruptive payment businesses into a single autonomous company, providing global technology solutions for our banks and new customers in the open market, and which has been structured into three businesses, previously included in SGP: • Merchant Solutions: acquiring solutions for merchants.
• Trade Solutions: solutions for SMEs and companies operating internationally.
• Consumer Solutions: payment solutions for individuals aimed at underbanked populations.
– Annual adjustment of the perimeter of the Global Customer Relationship Model between Retail Banking and Santander Corporate & Investment Banking and between Retail Banking and Wealth Management & Insurance.
– Elimination of the Santander Global Platform reporting segment: • Openbank and ODS are now recorded in the Retail Banking segment.
• The remaining Santander Global Platform businesses form the new PagoNxt reporting segment.
Grupo Santander recasted the corresponding information of earlier periods considering the changes included in this section. As stated above, group consolidated figures remain unchanged.
a) Primary segments This primary level of segmentation, which is based on the Group’s management structure, comprises five reportable segments: four operating areas plus the Corporate Centre. The operating areas are: • Europe: which comprises all business activity carried out in the region, except that included in Digital Consumer Bank. Detailed financial information is provided on Spain, the UK, Portugal and Poland.
• North America: which comprises all the business activities carried out in Mexico and the US, which includes the holding company (SHUSA) and the businesses of Santander Bank, Santander Consumer USA, the specialized business unit Banco Santander International, Santander Investment Securities (SIS) and the New York branch.
• South America: includes all the financial activities carried out by Grupo Santander through its banks and subsidiary banks in the region. Detailed information is provided on Brazil, Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Peru and Colombia.
• Digital Consumer Bank: includes Santander Consumer Finance, which incorporates the entire consumer finance business in Europe, Openbank and ODS.
In addition to these operating units, which report by geographic area and businesses, Grupo Santander continues to maintain the area of Corporate Centre, that includes the centralized activities relating to equity stakes in financial companies, financial management of the structural exchange rate position, assumed within the sphere of Grupo Santander’s assets and liabilities committee, as well as management of liquidity and of shareholders’ equity via issuances.
As Grupo Santander’s holding entity, this area manages all capital and reserves and allocations of capital and liquidity with the rest of businesses. It also incorporates amortization of goodwill but not the costs related to the Grupo Santander’s central services (charged to the areas), except for corporate and institutional expenses related to the Grupo Santander’s functioning.
With regard to the balance sheet, due to the required segregation of the various business units (included in a single consolidated balance sheet), the amounts lent and borrowed between the units are shown as increases in the assets and liabilities of each business. These amounts relating to intra-Group liquidity are eliminated and are shown in the Intra-Group eliminations column in the table below in order to reconcile the amounts contributed by each business unit to the consolidated Grupo Santander's balance sheet.
There are no customers located in any of the areas that generate income exceeding 10% of Total income.

The results of the hedging positions in each country are also included, conducted within the sphere of their respective assets and liabilities committees.
• Santander Corporate & Investment Banking (SCIB): this business reflects revenue from global corporate banking, investment banking and markets worldwide including treasuries managed globally (always after the appropriate distribution with Retail Banking customers), as well as equity business.
• Wealth Management & Insurance: includes the asset management business (Santander Asset Management), the corporate unit of Private Banking and International Private Banking in Miami and Switzerland (Santander Private Banking) and the insurance business (Santander Insurance).
• PagoNxt: this includes digital payment solutions, providing global technology solutions for Grupo Santander's banks and new customers in the open market. It is structured in three businesses: Merchant Solutions, International Trade and Consumer.
Although WM&I and PagoNxt do not meet the quantitative thresholds defined in IFRS 8, these segments are considered reportable by Grupo Santander and are disclosed separately because Grupo Santander's management believes that information about these segments are useful to users of the financial statements.
There are no customers located in a place different from the location of the Group's assets that generate revenues in excess of 10% of ordinary revenues.

Auditor's Consolidated Notes to the consolidated Contents report financial statements financial statements Appendix 53. Risk management a) Risk principles and culture Grupo Santander´s risk principles below are compulsory. They comply with regulatory requirements and are inspired by best market practices: 1. All employees are risk managers who must understand the risks associated with their functions and not assume risks with an impact that exceeds the Group’s risk appetite or is unknown.
2. Involvement of senior managers, with consistent risk management and control through their conduct, actions and communications, as well as oversight of the risk culture and make sure Grupo Santander maintain the risk profile within the defined risk appetite.
3. Independent risk management and control functions, according to the three lines of defence model of Grupo Santander.
4. A forward-looking, comprehensive approach to risk management and control for all businesses and risk types.
5. Complete and timely information to identify, assess, manage and disclose risks to the appropriate level.
Grupo Santander’s holistic control structure stands on these principles and includes strategic tools and processes set out in the risk appetite statement, such as annual planning and budget planning, scenario analysis, the risk reporting structure and risk identification and assessment.
1. Risk factors Grupo Santander's risks categorization ensures effective risk management, control and reporting. The risk framework distinguishes these risk types: • Credit risk relates to financial loss arising from the default or credit quality deterioration of a customer or counterparty, to which Santander has directly provided credit or assumed a contractual obligation.
• Market risk results from changes in interest rates, exchange rates, equities, commodities and other market factors, and from their effect on profit or capital. It includes the structural risk relates to market movements or balance sheets behaviour will change the value or profit generation of assets or liabilities in the banking book.
• Liquidity risk occurs if liquid financial resources are insufficient or too costly to obtain in order to meet liabilities when they fall due.
• Capital risk is the risk that arises from the possibility of having an inadequate quantity or quality of capital to meet internal business objectives, regulatory requirements or market expectations in the area of structural risk.
Grupo Santander also takes into account, on an ongoing basis in its management of the risk function, operational, regulatory compliance, model, reputational and strategic risks.
Besides, environmental and climate-related risk drivers are considered as factors that could impact the existing risks in the medium-to-long-term. These elements include, on the one hand, those derived from the physical effects of climate change, generated by one-off events as well as by chronic changes in the environment and, on the other hand, those derived from the process of transition to a development model with lower emissions, including legislative, technological or behaviour of economic agents changes.
The analysis of climate change scenarios has continued to advance during 2021 in the Group to try to cover the different casuistry related to the risks of transition to a low-carbon economy and/or the effects derived from the physical risk of possible climatic events in certain geographies where the Group operates.
Grupo Santander continues to make progress in the credit granting process following the EBA guidelines as well as in the development of a more restrictive financing policy, taking special account of the most sensitive sectors/activities, which includes ceasing to provide financial services to medium term to electricity generation customers with more than 10% of revenues dependent on coal and eliminate exposure to coal mining production in the world.
Grupo Santander has scheduled a series of actions to continue integrating climatic and environmental factors in the credit admission process, through i) their incorporation in the assessment processes of local credit committees, ii) their inclusion in the assignment of corporate ratings in the wholesale market (with a future expansion to retail banking) and in the process of setting prices through the entities' own ratings and the specific pricing that already exists for specific products with discount rates based on the fulfillment of various conditions , and iii) the inclusion of energy certificates in the valuation of collaterals.
Additionally, Grupo Santander has increased focus on the impact of climate risk in relation to market, structural and liquidity risk, which arise from the possibility that changes in climate may adversely affect the value of a financial instrument, a portfolio or the Group as a whole. This risk may have an impact both on financial instruments value or portfolios and on Santander's liquidity. Grupo Santander measures this risk through stress scenarios for both market and liquidity risk, which arises from the possibility that climate change may adversely affect the value of a financial instrument, a portfolio or the Group as a whole 2. Risk governance Grupo Santander robust risk and compliance governance structure allows us to conduct effective oversight in line with our risk appetite. It stands on three lines of defence, a structure of committees and strong Group-subsidiary relations, guided by our risk culture, Risk Pro.
2.1 Lines of defence Grupo Santander model of three lines of defence effectively manages and controls risks: – First line: formed by businesses and functions that take or originate exposure to risk, it recognizes, measures, controls, monitors and reports on risks according to internal risk management regulation. Risk origination must be consistent with the approved risk appetite and related limits.
– Second line: formed by the Risk and Compliance and Conduct functions, it independently oversees and challenges the first line’s risk management. Its duties include ensuring that risks are. 
Annual report 2021 731


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Auditor's Consolidated Notes to the consolidated Contents report financial statements financial statements Appendix managed according to the risk appetite defined by senior management and strengthening our risk culture throughout Grupo Santander.
– Third line: the Internal Audit function, which is independent to ensure the board of directors and senior managers with highquality and efficient internal controls, governance and risk management systems, helping to safeguard our value, solvency and reputation.
The Risk, Compliance & Conduct and Internal Audit functions are separate and independent. Each has direct access to the board of directors and its committees.
2.2 Risk committee structure. 
The board of directors is ultimately responsible for risk and compliance management and control. It revises and approves the bank's risk frameworks and appetite, while promoting a strong risk culture across the Group. The board relies on its risk supervision, regulation and compliance committee for risk control and on the group’s executive committee for risk approval.
The Group chief risk officer (Group CRO), who decides risk strategy and promotes proper risk culture, is in charge of overseeing all risks and challenging and advising business lines on risk management.
The Group chief compliance officer (Group CCO), who decides compliance and conduct strategy, is in charge of controlling the risks within their purview and must provide the Group CRO with a complete overview on the situation of risks being monitored.
Both the Group CRO and the Group CCO have direct access and report to the risk supervision, regulation and compliance committee and the board of directors.
The executive risk, risk control and compliance and conduct committees are executive committees and have been delegated powers by the board.
Furthermore, risk functions have forums and regular meetings to manage and control the risks within their purview. Executive committees also delegate some duties to subordinate forums.
Their responsibilities include: • Reporting to the Group CRO, the Group CCO, the risk control committee and the compliance and conduct committee on risk management according to risk appetite; • monitoring and ensuring proper management of each risk factor; and • overseeing measures to comply with supervisors and auditors' expectations.
Besides, Grupo Santander, in order to establish an adequate control environment for the management of each risk factors, the Risk and Compliance and Conduct functions have effective internal regulation to create the right environment to manage and control all risks.
Grupo Santander can also dictate new governance measures for special situations. During the Brexit crisis transition process, it set up separate steering committees and working groups with Santander UK. Also, to cope with the covid-19 crisis, it created special situation forums, in which close coordination with subsidiaries, local contingency plan activation and scenario analysis enhanced allocated resources and governance.
2.3 The Group's relationship with subsidiaries. 
In all subsidiaries, the risk and compliance management and control model is consistent with the frameworks approved by Grupo Santander's board of directors, which they adhere to through their own boards and can only adapt according to local law and regulation. In its duty to carry out aggregate risk oversight, Grupo Santander validates and challenges subsidiaries’ internal regulation and transactions, which results in a common risk management model across the Group.
In 2021, Grupo Santander continued to strengthen the regional subsidiary relations model, based on regions, to find synergies for common operations and platforms building on the global and regional scale; to streamline processes; and to tighten control mechanisms so Grupo Santander's business can grow, allocate capital more efficiently and offer the best service to customers.
In this sense, each local CRO interact regularly with their regional head of risk, the Group CRO and the Group CCO in periodic regional or country control meetings. Local and global Risk and Compliance functions also hold follow-up meetings to address special matters. The Group CRO and the Group CCO and regional heads of risk are involved in appointing, setting of objectives, reviewing and compensating their local counterparts to ensure proper risk management.
Grupo Santander enhances its relations with subsidiaries and its advanced risk management model through: • Close collaboration between countries in the same region to carry out common initiatives efficiently; • structural change, subsidiary benchmarks and a strategic vision for the function to implement advanced risk management infrastructures and practices; • the exchange of best practices to strengthen processes and drive innovation in order to achieve a quantitative impact.; • identification of talent in risk and compliance teams, promoting international mobility through a global risk talent programme and tightening succession plans.
3. Management processes and tools Grupo Santander has these effective risk management processes and tools: 3.1 Risk appetite and structure of limits Risk appetite is the volume and type of risks Grupo Santander deem prudent for the business strategy, even in unforeseen circumstances. It considers adverse scenarios that could have a negative impact on capital, liquidity and profitability.
The board sets the Group's risk appetite statement (RAS) every year. Grupo Santander subsidiaries' boards also set their own risk appetites annually. Each of those risk appetites translates into risk management limits and policies based on risk type, portfolio and segment.
3.1.1. Business model and risk appetite fundamentals Grupo Santander's risk appetite is consistent with the risk culture and business model built on customer focus, scale and diversification. At the core of Grupo Santander's risk appetite are:
Annual report 2021 732


 

 

 

 

 

 
Auditor's Consolidated Notes to the consolidated Contents report financial statements financial statements Appendix • A medium-low and predictable target risk profile that is centred on retail and commercial banking, internationally diversified operations and strong market share; • Stable, recurrent earnings and shareholder remuneration, sustained by a sound base of capital, liquidity and sources of funding; • Independent subsidiaries that manage their own capital and liquidity, with risk profiles that do not compromise Grupo Santander’s solvency; • An independent risk function with involvement by senior management to embed a strong risk culture and drive a sustainable return on capital; • A global and holistic vision through a meticulous control and monitoring of risks, businesses and markets; • A focus on products Grupo Santander know well; • A conduct model that protects Grupo Santander`s customers; and • A remuneration policy that aligns employees and executives' interests with risk appetite and long-term results.
3.1.2. Corporate risk appetite principles. 
The principles that inform Grupo Santander's risk appetite are: • The board and senior management's responsibility for risk appetite; • An enterprise-wide view of risk, back-testing and challenge of risk profile based on quantitative metrics and qualitative indicators; • A forward-looking view based on plausible assumptions and adverse/stress scenarios to reflect the desired risk profile in the short and medium term; • Strategic and business plans embedded in daily management by policies and limits; • Common standards that align each subsidiary's appetite with the Group's; and • Regular reviews, best practice and regulatory requirements, with mechanisms in place to keep the risk profile stable and mitigate non-compliance.
3.1.3. Structure of limits, monitoring and control Risk appetite is expressed in qualitative terms and limits, structured on these five core elements.
1. 
Earnings volatility The maximum loss Grupo Santander can tolerate in an acute -but- plausible stress scenario.
2. 
Solvency • Minimum capital position Grupo Santander can tolerate in a stress scenario. • Maximum leverage Grupo Santander can tolerate in a stress scenario.
3. 
Liquidity • Minimum structural liquidity position. • Minimum liquidity horizon Grupo Santander can tolerate in peak stress scenario. • Minimum liquidity coverage position.
4. 
Concentration • Concentration in single names, industries and portfolios. • Concentration in non-investment grade counterparties. • Concentration in large exposures.
5. 
Non-financial risks • Maximum operational risk losses. • Maximum risk profile. • Non-financial risk indicators: ◦ Financial crime compliance (FCC) ◦ Cyber and security risk ◦ Model risk ◦ Reputational risk b) Credit risk 1. Introduction to the credit risk treatment Credit risk refers to a potential financial loss from the default or credit quality deterioration of a customer or other third party with whom Grupo Santander has a contractual obligation. It is our most important risk, both in terms of exposure and capital consumption. It also includes counterparty risk, country risk and sovereign risk.
Credit risk management Grupo Santander identifies, analyses, controls and decides on credit risk based on holistic view of the credit risk cycle, which includes the transaction, the customer and the portfolio.
Credit risk identification is key to managing and controlling Grupo Santander's portfolios effectively. Grupo Santander classify external and internal risks in each business and adopt corrective and mitigating measures when needed through these processes: 1.1. Planning Grupo Santander´s planning helps to set business targets and define specific action plans within our risk appetite framework.
Strategic commercial plans (SCP) are a management and control tool the business and risk areas prepare for Grupo Santander's credit portfolios. They determine commercial strategies, risk policies, resources and infrastructure, ensuring a holistic view of the portfolios. They provide managers with an updated view of credit portfolio quality to measure credit risk, run internal controls over the defined strategy coupled with regular monitoring, detect significant deviations in risk and potential impacts, and take corrective actions when necessary. They also align with Grupo Santander's risk.

Auditor's Consolidated Notes to the consolidated Contents report financial statements financial statements Appendix appetite and its subsidiaries’ capital targets, and are approved and monitored by senior managers at each subsidiary before being reviewed and validated by Grupo Santander.
1.2. Risk assessment and credit rating. 
To analyse customers’ ability to meet contractual obligations, Grupo Santander uses valuation and parameter estimation models in each of the segments. Grupo Santander's credit quality valuation models are based on credit rating drivers, which Grupo Santander monitors to calibrate and adjust the decisions and ratings they assign. Depending on each segment, drivers can be: • Rating: from mathematical algorithms that have a quantitative model based on balance sheet ratios or macroeconomic variables, and a qualitative module supplemented by the credit analyst’s expert judgement. It is used for SCIB, corporate, institutional and SME segments (with individualised treatment).
• Scoring: an automatic system to evaluate credit applications that assigns an individual score to customers for subsequent decisionmaking, generally in the retail and smaller SME segments.
Grupo Santander's parameter estimation models follow econometric models built on Grupo Santander's portfolios' historical defaults and losses. Grupo Santander uses them to calculate economic and regulatory capital as well as IFRS 9 provisions for each portfolio.
Grupo Santander regularly monitoring and evaluate models' appropriateness, predictive capacity, performance, granularity, compliance with policies and other related factors. Grupo Santander reviews ratings with the latest available financial and economic information. Grupo Santander has also increased the reviews for customers who are under closer observation or have automatic warnings in the risk management systems.
1.3. Credit risk mitigation techniques. 
We approve risks generally on the basis of borrowers’ ability to pay in fulfilment of financial obligations, notwithstanding any additional collateral or personal guarantees we can require from them. To determine this, we analyse funds or net cash flows from their businesses or income with no guarantors or the assets pledged as collateral. We always consider guarantors and collateral when deciding to approve a loan as a secondary means of recourse if the first channel fails.
In general, a guarantee is as a reinforcement measure added to a credit transaction to mitigate a loss due to a failure to meet a payment obligation.
Grupo Santander has credit risk mitigation techniques for various types of customer and products. Some are for specific transactions (e.g., property) while others apply to a series of transactions (e.g., derivatives netting and collateral). Grupo Santander can be grouped into personal guarantees, guarantees in the form of credit derivatives or collateral.
1.4. Definition of limits, pre-classifications and pre-approvals Grupo Santander uses SCPs to manage credit portfolios, defining limits for each of them and for new originations, in line with the Group´s credit risk appetite and its target risk profile. Transposing the risk appetite to portfolio management strengthens controls over our credit portfolios.
Grupo Santander´s limits, pre-classifications and pre-approvals processes determine the risk we can assume with each customer.
Limits are approved by the executive risk committee (or delegated committees) and should reflect a transaction’s expected risk-return. 
Grupo Santander applies various limits models to each segment: • Large corporate groups: are subject to a pre-classification model based on a system for measuring and monitoring economic capital. Pre-classification models express the level of risk Grupo Santander is willing to assume in transactions with customers/ groups in terms of capital at risk, nominal cap and maximum tenors. To manage limits with financial entities, Grupo Santander uses Credit Equivalent Risk (CER), which includes actual and expected risks with customers according to risk appetite and credit policies.
• Corporates and institutions: that meet certain requirements (strong relationships, rating, etc.): Grupo Santander uses simpler pre-classification model with an internal limit. It establishes a reference point in a customer's level of risk based on repayment capacity, overall indebtedness and a pool of banks.
Transactions with large corporates, corporates and institutions above certain limits or with special characteristics could require approval from a senior credit analyst or a committee.
• For individual customers and SMEs with low turnover, Grupo Santander manages large volumes of credit transactions with automatic decision models to classify customers and transactions.
1.5. Scenario analysis. 
Grupo Santander´s scenario analyses determine the potential risks in its credit portfolios and provide a better understanding of our portfolios' performance under various macroeconomic conditions.
They allow us to anticipate management strategies that will avoid future deviations from defined plans and targets. They simulate the impact of alternative scenarios in portfolios’ credit parameters (PD, LGD) and expected credit losses. We compare findings with portfolios’ credit profile indicators to find the right measures for managers to take. Credit risk management of portfolios and SCPs incorporate scenario analyses.
1.6. Monitoring. 
Regularly monitoring business performance and comparing it to predefined plans is key to our management of risk.
Grupo Santander's holistic monitoring of customers helps detect impacts on risk performance and credit quality early.
Grupo Santander assigns customers a classification with a predefined course of action and ad hoc measures to correct any deviations.
Monitoring, which considers transaction forecasts and characteristics, in addition to changes in classification, is performed by local and global risk teams and is based on customer segmentation: • For SCIB, monitoring is initially a function of business managers and risk analysts which provide an up-to-date view of customers’ credit quality to predict a potential customer's deterioration.
• For commercial banking, institutions and SMEs assigned a credit analyst, Grupo Santander tracks customers requiring closer monitoring and review their ratings based on relevant indicators.
Annual report 2021 734


 

 

 

 
Auditor's Consolidated Notes to the consolidated Contents report financial statements financial statements Appendix • Monitoring of individual customers, businesses and smaller SMEs follows a system of automatic alerts to detect shifts in portfolios’ performance.
Monitoring uses the Santander Customer Assessment Note (SCAN) tool. Grupo Santander fully rolled it out in our subsidiaries in 2019. It helps set individual monitoring levels and frequencies, policies, and actions for customers based on credit quality and particular circumstances.
In addition to monitoring customer credit quality, Grupo Santander defines control procedures to analyse portfolios and performance, as well as any deviations from planning or approved alert levels.
1.7. Recovery and collections management. 
The Collections & Recoveries area carries out recoveries, which are important to risk management. It defines a global, enterprise-wide management strategy with guidelines and general lines of action for Grupo Santander's subsidiaries based on the economic environment. business model and other local recovery conditions. Recovery management follows regulatory requirements set out in the EBA Guidelines on the management of non-performing and forborne exposures. In addition, Grupo Santander applies specific policies on recovery management that include the principles of the different strategies.
The Collections & Recoveries areas directly manage customers. As sustained value creation is based on effective and efficient collections, digital channels that develop new customer relations are gaining importance. Grupo Santander's diverse customer base requires segmentation to manage recoveries appropriately. The highly technological and digital processes Grupo Santander follows help us attend to large groups of customers with similar profiles and products. Grupo Santander's personalized management, however, focuses on customer profiles that require a special manager and approach.
Grupo Santander splits recovery management into four phases: arrears, credit impaired loans, write-offs and foreclosed assets. Grupo Santander may uses mechanisms to rapidly reduce assets like sales of foreclosed assets or credit impaired loans pool sales. Grupo Santander constantly seeks alternatives to legal action in order to collect debt.
Grupo Santander includes debt instruments as written-off loans (even if they are not past-due) if an individual analysis of the solvency of a transaction and the borrower leads us to believe recovery is remote due to a notorious and unrecoverable impairment. Though this may lead to full or partial cancellation and de-recognition of the gross carrying amount of debt, it does not mean we interrupt negotiations and legal proceedings to recover debt. In countries with high exposure to real estate risk, we have efficient sales management instruments that help maximize recovery and optimize balance sheet stocks.

Information on the estimation of impairment losses Estimation of expected credit losses:
The covid-19 health crisis, since its beginning in 2020, was unexpected, unpredictable and severe, but it is estimated to be of a temporary nature. Grupo Santander's priority in these circumstances has been to look after the health of its employees, customers and shareholders, but also to help reduce the economic impact of the pandemic. This includes trying to offer the best solutions to help customers.
Conceptually, the phases in managing the effects of covid-19 have been: – Identification of customers or groups affected or potentially affected by the pandemic.
– Early relief of temporary financial difficulties caused by covid-19 through measures promoted by governments, central banks, and financial institutions.
– Monitoring the evolution of customers, to ensure that they continue to be provided with the best solution for their situation, and also to guarantee that their potential impairment is correctly reflected in the risk management and accounting. This point is particularly relevant at the expiry of any moratorium or liquidity support measures to which customers may have availed themselves.
– Monitoring is accompanied by recovery management activities when necessary.

Auditor's Consolidated Notes to the consolidated Contents report financial statements financial statements Appendix. 
These conceptual phases do not occur sequentially but overlap in time. Additionally, the continuous interaction and coordination between the different subsidiaries proved to be a fundamental asset in the management of this crisis. The experience obtained in the fight against the health crisis and its financial consequences in our different geographies, and the different speeds at which it has been developing in each of them, allow us to share the best practices identified and to implement in an agile and efficient manner those strategies and concrete actions that have been most successful, always adapted to the local reality of each market.
Estimation of expected loss In the context described above on the measures taken in relation to covid-19, many regulators and supervisors highlighted the uncertainties surrounding the economic impacts of the health crisis. This is also evident in the frequent updates of macroeconomic forecasts, with different perspectives and views on the depth and duration of the crisis. Thus, the general recommendation (including IASB, ESMA, EBA and ECB) was not to mechanistically apply the usual techniques for calculating expected losses under IFRS 9, in order to avoid that this variability of economic conditions would translate into volatility in results, with its potential pro-cyclical effects on the economy.
Thus, Grupo Santander has analysed losses under IFRS 9 on the basis of three types of elements: 1.Continuous monitoring of customers. 
Monitoring the credit quality of customers could have been more complex in the current circumstances. For such monitoring, and in addition to the application of internal customer monitoring policies, all available information should be used. The availability of information and its relevance is different in the various portfolios of the different countries in which Grupo Santander operates, but it may include, but is not limited to the following: – The payment of interest in the case of principal-only shortfalls.
– The payment of other operations of the same client in the institution (not subject to moratorium).
– Information on payment of loans in other entities (through credit bureaus).
– Customer financial information: average balances in current accounts, availability/use of limits, etc.
– Available behavioural elements (variables that feed the behavioural scores, etc.).
– Information gathered from customer contacts (surveys, calls, questionnaires, etc.). This may include: customers who have taken up furlough programs, direct government aid, etc.
2. Forward-looking vision. 
As it was reflected by the IASB, macroeconomic uncertainty makes the usual application of IFRS 9 expected loss calculation models difficult but did not exempt the incorporation of the prospective feature of the standard. To this end, the European Central Bank recommended the use of a stable, long-term view (long-run) of the macroeconomic forecasts, which takes into account in the assessment the multiple support measures explained above.
During 2021, this uncertainty has been reduced as vaccination progressed, hospitalisation rates gradually declined, allowing, in some cases, for the reduction of restriction measures. In parallel, support measures expired while maintaining the good performance of the portfolios.
This implies that once the economic scenarios have been stabilising and converging to their potential growth, these new economic scenarios have been gradually updated in the models by returning to the standard forward-looking calculation.
3. Additional elements. 
Additional elements will be required when necessary because they have not been captured under the two previous elements. This has included, among others, the analysis of sectors most affected by the pandemic if their impacts are not sufficiently captured by the macroeconomic scenarios. Also collective analysis techniques, when the potential impairment in a group of clients cannot be identified individually.
With the elements indicated above, Grupo Santander has evaluated in each of the geographical areas the evolution of the credit quality of its customers, for the purposes of their classification in Grupo Santander financial statements.
In terms of classification, in 2021 Grupo Santander has maintained the criteria and thresholds for classification applied prior to the start of the pandemic, eliminating regulatory criteria of the effect of moratorium classification as they have expired, as well as the collective analyses associated with these groups of loans.
Regarding moratorium measures, a rigorous identification and periodic monitoring of the credit quality of the clients and their payment behaviour have been carried out and, through a specific individual or collective evaluation, the timely detection of the Significant Increase in Credit Risk (SICR).
As part of governance processes, Grupo Santander issued guideline documents to all subsidiaries to ensure consistent standards and governance in managing the new treatment and particular impacts on pandemic-related provisions. The guidelines included instructions on how to calculate the macroeconomic impact of the crisis using overlay and potential collective assessments that considered impairment caused by covid-19. Those documents also include a monitoring guide to ensure the appropriateness of special insolvency fund adjustments for covid-19-related situations and anticipate any other necessary adjustment.
Regarding moratoria measures, a rigorous identification and regular monitoring of customer credit quality and payment behavior have been performed and through specific individual or collective assessment, the timely detection of SICR have been assured.
Details of the exposure by stage can be found in notes 6, 7, 10, as well as in this note of these consolidated annual accounts.
Grupo Santander estimates the impairment losses by calculating the expected loss at 12 months or for the entire life of the transaction, based on the stage in which each financial asset is classified in accordance with IFRS 9.
Then, considering the most relevant units of the Group (United Kingdom, Spain, United States, Brazil, also Chile, Mexico, Portugal, Poland, Argentina and Santander Consumer Finance), which represent approximately 96% of the total Group's provisions. The.

As of 31 December 2021, the Group had EUR 420 million net of provisions (EUR 497 million and EUR 706 million at 31 December 2020 and 2019, respectively) of purchased credit-impaired assets, which relate mainly to the business combinations carried out by the Group.
Regarding the evolution of credit risk provisions, the Group, in collaboration with the main geographical areas, monitors them by carrying out sensitivity analyses considering changes in macroeconomic scenarios and main variables that have an impact on the financial assets distribution in the different stages and calculating credit risk provisions.

Additionally, based on consistent macroeconomic scenarios, the Group also performs stress tests and sensitivity analysis in a regular basis, such as ICAAP, strategic plans, budgets and recovery and resolution plans. In this sense, a prospective view of the sensitivity of each of the Group’s loan portfolio is created in relation to the possible deviation from the base scenario, considering both the macroeconomic developments in different scenarios and the three year evolution of the business. These tests include potentially adverse and favourable scenarios.

In order to determine the classification in stage 2, the Group assesses whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) since the initial recognition of the transactions, considering a series of common principles throughout the Group that guarantee that all financial instruments are subject to this assessment, which considers the particularities of each portfolio and type of product on the basis of various quantitative and qualitative indicators. Furthermore, transactions are subject to the expert judgement of the analysts, who set the thresholds under an effective integration in management. All is implemented according to the approved governance.

• Materiality: its implementation must be also consistent with the relevance of each portfolio so as not to incur in unnecessary costs or efforts.
• Holistic vision: the approach selected must be a combination of the most relevant credit risk aspects (e.g. quantitative and qualitative).
• Application of IFRS 9: the approach must take into consideration IFRS 9 characteristics, focusing on a comparison with credit risk at initial recognition, as well as considering forward-looking information.
• Risk management integration: the criteria must be consistent with those metrics considered in the day-to-day risk management.
• Documentation: Appropriate documentation must be prepared.

The techniques are summarised below: • Stability of stage 2: in the absence of significant changes in the portfolios credit quality, the volume of assets in stage 2 should maintain a certain stability as a whole.
• Economic reasonableness: at transaction level, stage 2 is expected to be a transitional rating for exposures that could eventually move to a deteriorating credit status at some point or stage 3, as well as for exposures that have suffered credit deterioration and whose credit quality is improving.
• Predictive power: it is expected that the SICR definition avoids, as far as possible, direct migrations from stage 1 to stage 3 without having been previously classified in stage 2.
• Time in stage 2: it is expected that the exposures do not remain categorized as stage 2 for an excessive time.
The application of the aforementioned techniques, conclude in the setting of one or several thresholds for each portfolio in each geography. Likewise, these thresholds are subject to a regular review by means of calibration tests, which may entail updating the thresholds types or their values.
Covid-19 credit risk evolution and customer support programmes In the context of the general response of Santander to the covid-19 pandemic, and specifically with the purpose to help the customers from the credit perspective and foster their economic resilience during the crisis, Grupo Santander implemented several actions in addition to those listed above, the following: • The severity of the pandemic's effects was significantly different depending on the economic sector. Consequently, Santander launched a process to identify those that could be more affected in order to focus credit risk management on them.
• Due to the covid-19 crisis, great focus was placed on collections & recoveries readiness across Grupo Santander to deal with the impact expected on its portfolios once the support measures granted have expired.
Since the start of the pandemic in 2020, at the end of December 2021, Grupo Santander granted a total of EUR 93,112 million in payment moratoria, equivalent to 9.68% of the loan portfolio.
From the total moratoria, 99.8% had expired at 31 December 2021, from which 74.6% were classified in stage 1, 18.7% in stage 2 and 6.7% in stage 3. At December 2020, 79.1% of total moratoria has expired, from which 82.4% classified in stage 1, 14.5% in stage 2 and 3.1% in stage 3.
At the end of December 2021, total lending under government liquidity programmes amounted to EUR 39,879 million. By geography, Spain represent 68% of total exposure granted to these types of programmes, with an average coverage of ICO guarantees of 77%. UK constitutes the 13% of total exposure with an average coverage of 98%.
Quantification of additional provisions for covid-19 In relation to the measures in the insolvency funds, the Group set up additional provisions during 2020 based on a collective analysis of vulnerable sectors, and segments affected by the crisis derived from the covid-19 pandemic, as well as an estimate of the additional impairment of the loan and advance portfolio caused by the economic effects of the pandemic, realistically reflecting the structural deterioration of the economy at the date of construction of the estimate. This estimate was made on the basis of the information available at that date, which was affected by the high degree of uncertainty at the time of the estimate, and was aligned with the projections generated by the ECB. This macroeconomic scenario included a balance between short- and long-term forecasts, without being a 'through the cycle' scenario. The convergence of these scenarios with pre-crisis paths was expected to occur in the first quarter of 2022 for most macroeconomic indicators (except for house prices, which were expected to converge in the first quarter of 2023).
Grupo Santander has continuously and regularly monitored the following aspects during 2021 and 2020: (1) the evolution of the pandemic and the macroeconomic outlook, (2) forecasts from institutions and central banks, and (3) the evolution of portfolios in each of the countries where Grupo Santander is present.
Based on that monitoring, the Group updates and evaluates the adequacy of the macroeconomic scenarios in accordance with the established governance, when reliable and supportable information is available. At the end of 2021, we updated the most recent scenarios to calculate IFRS 9 provisions by recalibrating and revising the forward-looking information and risk model parameters. Following that process, during 2021 the model update included the macroeconomic scenarios. Out of the EUR 3,105 million at the end of December 2020, EUR 1,235 million overlay remain in additional provisions, motivated by several countries' government relief measures, in particular income support measures in the US, payment holiday extensions for longer periods in Portugal, and from continued volatility in the UK.
3.Detail of the main geographical areas Following is the risk information related to the most relevant geographies in exposure and credit risk allowances.
This information includes sensitivity analysis, consisting on simulations of +/-100 bp in the main macroeconomic variables. A set of specific and complete scenarios is used in each geography, where different shocks that affect both the reference variable as well as the rest of the parameters is simulated. These shocks may be originated by productivity, tax, wages or exchange and interest rates factors. Sensitivity is measured as the average variation on expected loss corresponding to the aforementioned scenarios. Following a conservative approach, the negative movements take into account one additional standard deviation in order to reflect the potential higher variability of losses.
3.1. United Kingdom Credit risk with customers in the UK grew 4.2% (-2.5% in local currency) year-on-year to EUR 262,869 million. The UK accounts for 25% of Santander’s loan portfolio.
Since the pandemic began, Santander granted 368,000 moratoriums and EUR 5,280 million in government-backed loans to help our customers.

The NPL ratio in 2021, 1.43%, increased as compared to 2020 (+19 bps) due to the increase in SME segment, as well as the decrease of the portfolio in the wholesale segment. The profile of the different segments remains stable.
Mortgage portfolio Because of its size, we closely monitor Santander UK’s mortgage portfolio for the entity itself and Grupo Santander.
As of December 2021, it amounted to EUR 209,949 million, growing by +4.3% in local currency. It comprises residential mortgages granted to new and existing customers which are first lien mortgages. There are no second or more liens on mortgaged properties.
2021 was a year of strong mortgage activity, mainly due to the higher demand after the covid-19 restrictions were lifted and the reduction of the stamp duty rates up until September. As a consequence, Santander UK achieved all-time high mortgage lending origination levels in June.
In accordance with Santander's risk management principles, properties are appraised independently before we approve a new mortgage.
In line with market practice and legislation, property values used as collateral for granted mortgages are updated quarterly by an independent agency's automatic appraisal system.
Information on the estimation of impairment losses The detail of Santander's UK exposure and impairment losses associated with each of the stages at 31 December, 2021, 2020 and 2019, is shown below.
In addition, the exposure is divided in three tranches of the Standard & Poor's rating scale, according to their current credit quality:

The Government support measures taken in the United Kingdom in 2020 as response to the covid-19 pandemic have gradually expired and at the end of December 2021, Santander UK had granted, since the start of the pandemic, a total amount of EUR 40,949 million moratoriums, equivalent to 16.53% of the loan portfolio.
100% of the moratoriums granted had expired at 31 December 2021, from which 81.7% were in stage 1, 15.2% in stage 2 and 3.1% in stage 3 (at the end of 2020, of the total moratoriums, 93.5% had expired, of which 83.6% were in stage 1, 14.7% in stage 2 and 1.7% in stage 3).

Auditor's Consolidated Notes to the consolidated Contents report financial statements financial statements Appendix. 
For the estimation of expected losses, prospective information is taken into account. Specifically, Santander UK considers five macroeconomic scenarios, which are updated periodically. The evolution forecasted in 2021 for the next five years of the main macroeconomic indicators used by Santander UK to estimate expected losses is presented below: 2022 - 2026. 
Variables Pessimistic scenario 3 Pessimistic scenario 2 Pessimistic scenario 1 Base scenario Optimistic scenario 1. 
Interest rate -0.1 % 2.0 % 0.8 % 0.7 % 1.1 %
Unemployment rate 8.4 % 6.4 % 5.1 % 4.4 % 4.0 %
Housing price change -5.0 % -3.0 % -1.5 % 2.2 % 1.5 %
GDP growth — 1.0 % 1.3 % 2.2 % 2.6 %
Each of the macroeconomic scenarios is associated with a given weight. In terms of allocation, Santander UK associates the highest weighting to the base scenario, while it associates the lowest weightings to the most extreme or severe scenarios. In addition, at 31 December 2021, the weights used by Santander UK reflect the future prospects of the British economy in relation to its current political and economic position so that higher weights are assigned for negative scenarios: 2021 2020 2019. 
Pessimistic scenario 3 5 % 10 % —
Pessimistic scenario 2 20 % 25 % 15 %
Pessimistic scenario 1 25 % 15 % 30 %
Base scenario 45 % 45 % 40 %
Optimistic scenario 1 5 % 5 % 10 %
Optimistic scenario 2 — — 5 %
The sensitivity analysis of the main portfolios expected loss to variations of +/-100 bp for the macroeconomic variables used in the construction of the scenarios, as of December 2021, is as follows:
Change in Provision. 
Mortgages Corporates. 
GDP Growth -100 bp 19.1 % 5.7 % 100 bp -6.7 % -1.0 %
Housing price change -100 bp 4.0 % 3.1 % 100 bp -3.7 % -0.6 %
Unemployment rate -100 bp -9.6 % -0.4 % 100 bp 21.0 % 0.4 %
With regards to the determination of classification in stage 2, the quantitative criteria applied by Santander UK are based on identifying whether any increase in PD for the expected life of the transaction is greater than both an absolute and a relative threshold (the PD used in that assessment are adjusted to the transaction's remaining term and also annualised in order to facilitate that the thresholds defined cover the whole range of the transactions maturity dates). The relative threshold established is common to all portfolios and a transaction is considered to exceed this threshold when the PD for the entire life of the transaction increases by 100% with respect to the PD at the time of initial recognition. The absolute threshold, on the other hand, is different for each portfolio depending on the characteristics of the transactions, ranging between 360 bp and 30 bp.
In addition, for each portfolio, a series of specific qualitative criteria is defined to indicate that the exposure has experienced a significant increase in credit risk, regardless of the evolution of its PD since the time of initial recognition. Santander UK, among other criteria, considers that an operation presents a significant increase in credit risk when it presents irregular positions for more than 30 days. These criteria depend on the risk management practices of each portfolio.
3.2. Spain. 
Portfolio overview Santander España’s credit risk totalled EUR 221,100 million (21% of Grupo Santander’s total). It is appropriately diversified among products and customer segments.
Amid economic and credit recovery, as macroeconomic figures improved after the end of the covid-19 lockdowns in 2020, consumer loans (especially mortgages) grew significantly, as the corporate and SME lending remained below 2020 numbers, as we maintained positions with customers in liquidity support programmes (i.e. ICO lines of credit) without having to seek new financing.
Total credit risk decreased -0.1% from December 2020. The ICO loans in Corporate and SME lending amounted to a significant EUR 27,294 (around half of them were extended according to the current regulation).
The credit portfolio’s NPL ratio was 5.77%, 46 bp lower than in December 2020. This better overall portfolio performance was driven by customer support programmes; the regularization of several restructured positions; and portfolio sales.
The additional provisions raised to mitigate the potential impacts from the exceptional circumstances of the covid-19 pandemic, increased the NPL coverage ratio to 52% (+5 bp vs. December 2020). On the other hand, the non-performing portfolio declined mainly from loans with the highest expected losses.
The cost of credit reflects the rise in Covid-19 provisions, with slight improvement at the end of 2021 compared to December 2020.

The real estate unit in Spain (UAI) was consolidated within Santander Spain in 2019, (this process was completed in 2020). Consequently, unlike in 2019, in 2021 and 2020 the perimeter is aligned.
The remaining legal entities to reach the entire portfolio in Spain contribute another EUR 5,693 million, EUR 445 million and EUR 237 million of exposure in 2019 in stage 1, stage 2 and stage 3 respectively, and impairment losses in the amount of EUR 55 million, EUR 41 million and EUR 8 million in stage 1, stage 2 and stage 3, respectively.
The Government support measures taken in Spain in 2020 as response to the covid-19 pandemic have gradually expired and at the end of December 2021 Santander Spain had granted, since the start of the pandemic in 2020, a total amount of EUR 9,819 million moratoriums, equivalent to 4.87% of the loan portfolio.
Of the total moratoriums, 99.6% had expired at 31 December 2021, from which 75.6% was in stage 1, 14.9% in stage 2 and 9.5% in stage 3. At the end of 2020, of the total moratoria, 26.4% had expired, of which 77.2% were in stage 1, 15% in stage 2 and 7.8% in stage 3.
For the estimation of the expected losses, the prospective information is taken into account. Specifically, Santander Spain considers three macroeconomic scenarios, which are updated periodically. The projected evolution for a period of five years of the main macroeconomic indicators used by Santander Spain for estimating expected losses as of 2021, is presented below: 2022-2026. 
Variables Pessimistic scenario Base scenario Optimistic scenario. 
Interest rate 0.6 % -0.2 % -0.2 %
Unemployment rate 18.3 % 13.0 % 11.2 %
Housing price change 1.6 % 2.6 % 3.2 %
GDP growth 1.1 % 2.9 % 3.7 %
Each macroeconomic scenarios is associated with a given weight. As for its allocation, Santander Spain associates the Base scenario with the highest weight, while associating the lower weights to the most extreme scenarios: 2021 2020 2019. 
Pessimistic scenario 30 % 30 % 30 %
Base scenario 40 % 40 % 40 %
Optimistic scenario 1 30 % 30 % 30 %
The sensitivity analysis of the main portfolios expected loss to variations of +/-100 bp for the macroeconomic variables used in the construction of the scenarios is as follows:
Change in Provision. 
Mortgages Corporates Others. 
GDP Growth -100 bp 11.9 % 5.4 % 4.9 % 100 bp -4.9 % -2.9 % -2.7 %
Housing price change -100 bp 4.1 % 3.2 % 3.3 % 100 bp -2.5 % -1.7 % -1.4 %
With regards to the stage 2 classification determination, the quantitative criteria applied in Santander Spain are based on identifying whether an increase in the PD for the expected lifetime of the transaction when compared to the one at its origination is greater than an absolute threshold. The threshold established is different for each portfolio based on the transactions characteristics, considering that a transaction is above this threshold when the PD for the life of the transaction increases by a certain quantity over the initial recognized PD. The values of these thresholds depend on their calibration, carried out periodically as indicated in the preceding paragraphs, which currently ranges from 25% to 1%, depending on the type of product and estimated sensitivity.

Auditor's Consolidated Notes to the consolidated Contents report financial statements financial statements Appendix. 
In the case of non-retail portfolios, Santander Spain uses the transaction's rating as a reference for its PD, taking into account its rating at the time of origination and its current rating, setting absolute thresholds for the different rating bands that depend on each portfolio characteristics. A SICR implies changes in the rating value between 0.1 and 4, depending on the portfolio and the estimated sensitivity (from lower to higher credit quality, the rating range goes from 1 to 9.3).
In addition, for each portfolio, a series of specific qualitative criteria are defined indicating that the exposure experienced a significant increase in credit risk, regardless of the evolution of its PD since the time of initial recognition. Santander Spain, among other criteria, considers that an operation presents a significant increase in credit risk when positions have been past due for more than 30 days. These criteria depend on the risk management practices of each portfolio.
Residential mortgage portfolio Residential mortgages in Spain, including Santander Consumer Finance business, amounted to EUR 62,324 million in 2021 (EUR 59,605 million and EUR 62,236 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively), 99.33% of which have a mortgage guarantee ( 99.35% and 99.51% in 2020 and 2019, respectively).

The mortgage portfolio for the acquisition of homes in Spain is characterised by its medium-low risk profile, which limits expectations of any potential additional impairment: • Principal is repaid on all mortgages from the start.
• Early repayment is common so the average life of the transaction is well below that of the contract.
• High quality of collateral, concentrated almost exclusively in financing for first homes.
• The average affordability rate stood at 27% (27% and 26% in 2020 and 2019, respectively).
• The 89.41% of the portfolio has a LTV below 80% calculated as total risk/latest available house appraisal.

Businesses portfolio Credit risk with SME and corporates amounted to EUR 117,544 million, 3.1% lower than in December 2020, mainly due to the fall in the portfolio of SMEs. This is Santander Spain's main lending segment, accounting for 51% of the total. Most of the portfolio corresponds to customers with an assigned credit analyst to monitor their loans throughout the risk cycle.
The portfolio is broadly diversified and not concentrated by sector of activity. 2021 was a year of stability in the portfolio figures after the significant growth in 2020 due to the liquidity support programmes (ICO), which after the initial grace period have begun to be amortised.
The portfolio’s NPL ratio stood at 7.50% in December 2021. Even though total risk decreased, the NPL ratio increased by 8 bp compared to December 2020, due to lower portfolio volume, while the stock of credit impaired loans slightly reduced.
Real estate activity The Real Estate Unit in Spain (UAI) was consolidated within Santander Spain in 2019 (this process was completed in 2020). The part of the portfolio resulting from the past financial crisis and the new business that is identified as viable should be differentiated. In both cases, Santander has specialized teams that are in charge of their management and risk areas that cover the entire life cycle of these operations.
In recent years the Group's strategy has been geared towards reducing these assets. The changes in gross property development loans to customers were as follows:
EUR million 2021 2020 2019. 
Balance at beginning of year 2,871 2,939 4,812. 
Foreclosed assets (1) (6) (29)
Reductions (230) (24) (1,685)
Written-off assets (15) (38) (159)
Balance at end of year 2,625 2,871 2,939. 
The NPL ratio of this portfolio ended the year at 5.07% (compared with 6.13% and 9.73% at December 2020 and 2019, respectively) due to the decrease of non-performing assets in the troubled loan portfolio and, in particular, to the sharp reduction in lending in this segment. The table below shows the distribution of the portfolio. The coverage ratio of the real estate doubtful exposure in Spain stands at 30.08% (32.95% and 35.31% in 2020 and 2019, respectively).

At year-end, the distribution of this portfolio was as follows: 2021. 
EUR Million Loans: gross amount 1. Without mortgage guarantee 180 2. With mortgage guarantee 2,445 2.1 Completed buildings 1,412 2.1.1 Residential 876 2.1.2 Other 536 2.2 Buildings and other constructions under 969 construction 2.2.1 Residential 907 2.2.2 Other 62 2.3 Land 64 2.3.1 Developed consolidated land 46 2.3.2 Other land 18. 
Total 2,625. 
Policies and strategies in place for the management of these risks The policies in force for the management of this portfolio are periodically reviewed and approved on a regular basis by Santander's senior management.
As has already been disclosed in this section, the Group’s anticipatory management of these risks enabled it to significantly reduce its exposure, and it has a granular, geographically diversified portfolio in which the financing of second residences accounts for a very small proportion of the total.
Mortgage lending on non-urban land represents a low percentage of mortgage exposure to land, while the remainder relates to land already classified as urban or approved for development.
The significant reduction of exposure in the case of residential financing projects in which the construction work has already been completed was based on various actions. As well as the specialised marketing channels already in existence, campaigns were carried out with the support of specific teams of managers for this function who, in the case of the Santander network, were directly supervised by the recoveries business area. These campaigns, which involved the direct management of the projects with property developers and purchasers, reducing sale prices and adapting the lending conditions to the buyers’ needs, enabled loans already in force to be subrogated. These subrogations enable the Group to diversify its risk in a business segment that displays a clearly lower non-performing loans ratio.
In the case of construction-phase projects that are experiencing difficulties of any kind, the policy adopted is to ensure completion of the construction work so as to obtain completed buildings that can be sold in the market. To achieve this aim, the projects are analysed on a case-by-case basis in order to adopt the most effective series of measures for each case (structured payments to suppliers to ensure completion of the work, specific schedules for drawing down amounts, etc.).
For the new post-crisis real estate business production, the admission processes are managed by specialized teams that work in direct coordination with the commercial teams, with clearly defined policies and criteria: • Property developers with a robust solvency profile and a proven track record in the market.
• Medium-high level projects, conducting to contracted demand and significant cities.
• Strict criteria regarding the specific parameters of the transactions: exclusive financing for the construction cost, high percentages of accredited sales, principal residence financing, etc.
• Support of financing of government-subsidised housing, with accredited sales percentages.
• Restricted financing of land purchases dealt with exceptional nature.
In addition to the permanent control performed by its risk monitoring teams, the Group has a specialist technical unit that monitors and controls this portfolio with regard to the stage of completion of construction work, planning compliance and sales control, and validates and controls progress billing payments. The Group has created a set of specific tools for this function. All mortgage distributions, amounts drawn down of any kind, changes made to the grace periods, etc. are authorised on a centralised basis.
Foreclosed properties At 31 December 2021, the net balance of these assets amounted to EUR 3,591 million gross amount: of EUR 7,364 million; recognised allowance: of EUR 3,773 million, of which EUR 2,729 million related to impairment after the foreclosure date. At 31 December 2020, the net balance of these assets amounted to EUR 3,962 million (gross amount: EUR 7,937 million; recognised allowance: EUR 3,975 million, of which EUR 2,834 million related to impairment after the foreclosure date). At 31 December, 2019, the net balance of these assets amounted to EUR 4,190 million (gross amount: EUR 8,226 million; recognised allowance: EUR 4,036 million, of which EUR 2,812 million related to impairment after the foreclosure date).

In addition, the Group has shareholdings in entities holding foreclosed assets amounting to EUR 701 million (mainly Project Quasar Investment 2017, S.L. with EUR 655 million), and equity instruments foreclosed or received in payment of debts amounting to EUR 16 million.
In recent years, the Group has considered foreclosure to be a more efficient method for resolving cases of default than legal proceedings. The Group initially recognises foreclosed assets at the lower of the carrying amount of the debt (net of provisions) and the fair value of the foreclosed asset (less estimated costs to sell).Subsequent to initial recognition, the assets are measured at the lower of fair value (less costs to sell) and the amount initially recognised.
The fair value of this type of assets is determined by the Group’s directors based on evidence obtained from qualified valuers or evidence of recent transactions.
The management of real estate assets on the balance sheet is carried out through companies specializing in the sale of real estate that is complemented by the structure of the commercial network. The sale is realised with at prices in accordance with the market situation and the offer of wholesale buyers.
The gross movement in foreclosed properties were as follows (EUR billion):

Santander Bank, National Association (SBNA) At 78% of total credit risk, retail and commercial banking is Santander Bank, National Association’s main business. 24% of the portfolio is with individuals, and approximately 76% with corporates. The bank's primary goals include expanding the SCIB business — 22% of total credit risk — by enhancing customer experience and growing core customers and deposits through digital, branch and commercial transformation initiatives; leveraging its deposit base to support its commercial real estate business; and strengthening its auto finance partnerships. Its 15.1% hike in lending spanned all segments. Excluding the FX effect, the increase was lower, standing at 9.2%.
The NPL ratio increased to 0.85% (+4 bp in the year) as of December 2021 the cost of credit fell to -0.06% due to the release of provisions based on better-than-expected market performance, customer behaviour (support programmes and fiscal stimulus) and greater workout recoveries.

For the estimation of expected losses, prospective information is taken into account. Specifically, Santander Bank, National Association considers four macroeconomic scenarios, which are updated periodically. The evolution projected in 2021 for a period of five years of the main macroeconomic indicators used Santander Bank, National Association to estimate expected losses is presented below: 2022 - 2026. 
Variables Pessimistic scenario 2 Pessimistic scenario 1 Base scenario Optimistic scenario. 
Interest rate (annual averaged) 0.2 % 1.2 % 1.3 % 1.7 %
Unemployment rate 6.6 % 4.6 % 3.8 % 3.3 %
House price change 1.2 % 1.7 % 2.3 % 2.8 %
GDP growth 2.3 % 2.8 % 2.7 % 3.3 %
Each of the macroeconomic scenarios is associated with a given weight. As for its allocation, Santander Bank, National Association associates the highest weighting to the Base scenario, while associates the lowest weightings to the most extreme scenarios: 2021 2020 2019. 
Pessimistic scenario 2 18 % 18 % 18 %
Pessimistic scenario 1 20 % 20 % 20 %
Base scenario 33 % 33 % 33 %
Optimistic scenario 30 % 30 % 30 %
In the case of SBNA, no additional 'long-run' scenario was generated for the calculation of the post model adjustment The additional provisions for covid-19 were calculated using the internal model.
The sensitivity analysis of the main portfolios expected loss to variations of +/-100 bp for the macroeconomic variables used in the construction of the scenarios as of 2021 is as follows:
Change in Provision. 
Mortgages Corporates. 
GDP Growth -100 bp 2.0% 7.4% 100 bp -1.4% -4.6%
Housing price change -100 bp 3.7% 12.4% 100 bp -2.0% -6.3%
Unemployment rate -100 bp -5.5% -15.1% 100 bp 6.6% 22.8%
In relation to the Stage 2 classification determination, the quantitative criteria applied at SBNA for retail portfolios uses the FICO (Fair Isaac Corporation) score at the time of origination and its current value, establishing different absolute threshold for each portfolio according to their characteristics. A SICR implies changes in that score ranging from 120 bp to 20 bp In the case of some portfolios, the behaviour score complements this criterion.
In the case of wholesale portfolios, SBNA uses the transaction's rating as a reference for its PD, taking into account its rating at the time of origination and its current rating, setting absolute thresholds for the different rating bands that depend on each portfolio characteristics. A SICR implies changes in the rating value between 2 and 0.1, depending on the portfolio and the estimated sensitivity (from lower to higher credit quality, the rating range goes from 1 to 9.3).
Additionally, for each portfolio, a series of specific qualitative criteria are defined, which indicate that the exposure has experienced a significant increase in credit risk, regardless of the evolution of its PD since the initial recognition. Santander Bank, National Association, among other criteria, considers that a transaction presents a significant increase in credit risk when it has arrears positions for more than 30 days. These criteria depend on the risk management practices of each portfolio.
Santander Consumer USA Inc. Santander Consumer USA Inc. (SC USA) presents higher risk indicators than other Santander US units due to the nature of its business, which focuses on auto finance via loans and leasing.
The focus continues to be on managing the relationship between profitability and risk, via management of prices adjusted to the credit quality of the customer/transaction, while improving the dealers' experience.
In 2021, loan originations grew more than 4% year-on-year, returning to the pre-pandemic prime and non-prime mix on the back of the commercial relationship we have with Stellantis Group. The production mix resumed the segmentation between prime and nonprime prior to the pandemic.
Auto originations continued to increase, driven mainly by hikes in used car prices and demand.
As of December, the NPL ratio rose to 6.27% (+101 bp in the year) and the cost of credit stood at 1.54% (-654 bp YoY). Annual net credit losses fell year on year due to customer support programmes (triggered by the health crisis), federal fiscal stimulus packages and greater recovery driven by a surge in used car prices. Due to the increase in defaults, the non-performing coverage ratio fell to 176% (-54 bp in the year).
Furthermore, leases carried out exclusively under the Stellantis Group agreement (primarily with highly creditworthy customers) dropped 5% to EUR 13,600 million, providing stable and recurring earnings. Risk management and residual value mitigation measures remain a priority.

Since the start of the pandemic in 2020, SC USA has granted a total amount of EUR 5,370 million moratoriums, equivalent to 18.11% of the loan portfolio, at the end of 31 December 2021.
100% of the moratoriums granted had expired at 31 December, 2021, which 2.8% were in stage 1, 68.7% in stage 2 and 28.5% in stage 3 (at the end of 2020, of the total moratoriums, 89.8% had expired, of which 78.5% were in stage 1, 14.6%in stage 2 and 6.9% in stage 3).
Given the nature of its business focused on auto financing for individuals, no loans were granted by liquidity programs in SC USA.
SC USA reassessed the suitability of macroeconomic scenarios and adjusted them in light of new information. At the end of 2021, we updated the most recent scenarios to calculate IFRS 9 provisions by recalibrating and revising the forward-looking information and risk model parameters. After this process, there are additional provisions amounting to EUR 849 million mainly due to the volatility of used car prices and the end of public aid. The car price index during 2021 presents an unusually high value, as a result of the exceptional covid-19 context.
In relation to the methodology used to calculate impairment losses, Santander Consumer USA Inc. uses a method for calculating expected losses based on the use of risk parameters: EAD (exposure at default), PD (probability of default) and LGD (loss given default). The expected loss is calculated by adding the estimated monthly expected losses for the entire life of the operation, unless the operation is classified in Stage 1, which will correspond to the sum of the estimated monthly expected losses during the following 12 months.
In general, there is an inverse relationship between the transactions credit quality and the impairment losses projections so that transactions with better credit quality require a lower expected loss. Transactions credit quality, which is reflected in the internal rating associated to each transaction or client, is shown in the probability of default of the transactions.
For the expected losses estimation, prospective information should be taken into account. Specifically, Santander Consumer USA Holdings Inc. considers four macroeconomic scenarios, periodically updated over a 5-year time horizon.

In the case of SC USA, no additional 'long-run' scenario was generated for the calculation of the post model adjustment. The additional provisions for covid-19 were calculated using the internal model.
The sensitivity analysis of the main portfolios expected loss to variations of +/-100 bp for the macroeconomic variables used in the construction of the scenarios at the end of 2021 is as follows:
Change in provision. 
SC Auto. 
Manheim index -100 bp 1.1 % 100 bp -0.7 %

GDP growth -100 bp 1.8 % 100 bp -1.2 %
In relation to the stage 2 classification determination, the quantitative criteria applied at SC USA uses the FICO (Fair Isaac Corporation) score at the time of origination and its current value, establishing different absolute threshold for each portfolio according to their characteristics. A SICR implies changes in that score ranging from 100 bp to 60 bp.
Additionally, for each portfolio, a series of specific qualitative criteria are defined, which indicate that the exposure has had a significant increase in credit risk, regardless of the evolution of its PD since the initial recognition. Santander Consumer USA Holdings Inc. among other criteria, considers that a transaction presents a significant increase in credit risk when it has irregular positions for more than 30 days. These criteria depend on the risk management practices of each portfolio.
3.4. Banco Santander (Brasil) S.A. Positive economic recovery due to the reopening of the service sector, in line with the advances in the vaccination campaigns and the lift of restrictions, although international supply problems have continued to hamper industry growth.
Santander Brasil's credit risk amounted to EUR 85,702 million. It increased by 15% from 2020. Minus the exchange rate effect, it grew by 13%. As of December 2021, Santander Brasil accounts for 8% of Grupo Santander's loan book.
The SME portfolio (Varejo PJ) grew significantly due to the contribution of the different billing clusters that make the portfolio and its different products. State-backed guarantees to combat the effects of the pandemic ended in December 2020, although a new window opened in July 2021.
Net loan-loss provisions stood at EUR 2,715 million (-10% compared to 2020), a decrease driven by additional provision made in 2020 related to covid-19. In local currency, provisions declined by 35%. Cost of credit decreased to 3.73% from 4.35% at the end of 2020, driven by the aforementioned provisions evolution.

The Government support measures taken in Brazil in 2020 as response to the covid-19 pandemic have gradually expired and at the end of December 2021, Santander Brazil had granted, since the start of the pandemic, a total amount of EUR 3,835 million moratoriums, equivalent to 5.35% of the loan portfolio.
Of the total moratoriums granted, 99.7% expired at 31 December 2021, from which 70.8% were in stage 1, 17.4% in stage 2 and 11.8% in stage 3. At the end of 2020, of the total moratoriums 92.4% had expired, of which 75.6% were in stage 1, 17.6% in stage 2 and 6.8% of in stage 3.
Total loans granted by liquidity programmes in Brazil amounted to EUR 1,563 million as of 31 December 2021.
For the expected losses estimation, prospective information is taken into account. Particularly, Santander Brazil considers three macroeconomic scenarios, periodically updated. The evolution for a period of five years of the main macroeconomic indicators used to estimate the expected losses in Santander Brazil is as follows: 2022-2026. 
Variables Pessimistic scenario Base scenario Optimistic scenario. 
Interest rate (annual averaged) 13.3 % 6.7 % 4.8 %
Unemployment rate 13.3 % 12.1 % 8.8 %
House price change 2.6 % 8.7 % 13.2 %
GDP growth -1.0 % 2.1 % 4.5 %
Burden income 38.9 % 34.9 % 29.2 %
Each macroeconomic scenario is associated with a given weight. Regarding its assignation, Brazil links the highest weight to the base scenario whilst links the lowest weights to the most extreme scenarios: 2021 2020 2019. 
Pessimistic scenario 10 % 10 % 10 %
Base scenario 80 % 80 % 80 %
Optimistic scenario 10 % 10 % 10 %
The sensitivity analysis of the main portfolios expected loss to variations of +/-100 bp for the macroeconomic variables used in the construction of the scenarios is at the end of 2021 as follows:
Change in provision. 
Consumer Corporate Other. 
GDP growth -100 bp 0.4 % 1.3 % 1.9 % 100 bp -0.1 % -0.6 % -0.9 %
Burden income -100 bp -0.3 % -0.5 % -1.3 % 100 bp 0.7 % 2.0 % 2.9 %
Interest rate (SELIC) -100 bp -0.1 % -0.5 % -0.8 % 100 bp 0.6 % 2.9 % 3.6 %
Regarding the stage 2 classification determination, Santander Brazil uses the transaction's rating as a reference for its PD, taking into account its rating at the time of origination and its current rating, setting different thresholds that depend on each portfolio characteristics. SICR is determined by observing the rating's evolution, considering that a significant increase in credit risk has occurred when the rating reduction reaches values between 3.2 and 1, depending on the rating's value at the time of origination.
In addition, for every portfolio, a set of specific qualitative criteria are defined to indicate that the exposure to credit risk has significantly risen, regardless of the evolution of its PD since the initial recognition. Santander Brazil, among other criteria, considers that an operations involves a significant increase in credit risk when it presents irregular positions for more than 30 days, but in Real State, Consigned and Financial portfolios, where, due to their particular attributes, they use a 60 days threshold. Such criteria depend upon each portfolio’s risk management practices.
4. Other credit risk aspects 4.1. Credit risk by activity in the financial markets This section covers credit risk generated in treasury activities with customers, mainly with credit institutions. Transactions are undertaken through money market financial products with different financial institutions and through counterparty risk products, which serve the Group’s customer needs.

Auditor's Consolidated Notes to the consolidated Contents report financial statements financial statements Appendix. 
According to regulation (EU) n.º 575/2013, counterparty credit risk, which includes derivative instruments, transactions with a repurchase obligation, stock and commodities lending, transactions with deferred repayment and financing of guarantees, arises from the likelihood that a counterparty will default before the final settlement of the transaction's cash flows.
There are two methodologies for measuring this exposure: (i) markto-market (MtM) methodology (replacement value of derivatives) plus potential future exposure (add-on); and the Montecarlo simulation to calculate exposures for some countries and products. We also calculate capital at risk and unexpected loss, which is the difference between the economic capital, net of guarantees and recoveries, and expected loss.
After market close, the exposures are recalculated by adjusting transactions to their new time frame, adapting potential future exposure and applying mitigation measures (netting, collateral, etc.) to control exposures directly against the limits approved by senior management. Grupo Santander runs risk control with an integrated system in real time that enables us to know the exposure limit with any counterparty, product and maturity and in any of Santander’s subsidiaries at any time.
4.2. Concentration risk Concentration risk control is a vital part of our management. The Group continuously monitors the degree of concentration of its credit risk portfolios using various criteria: geographic areas and countries, economic sectors and groups of customers.
The board, via the risk appetite framework, determines the maximum levels of concentration.
EUR million. 
In line with these maximum levels and limits, the executive risk committee establishes the risk policies and reviews the appropriate exposure levels for the effective management of the degree of concentration in Santander’s credit risk portfolios.
Grupo Santander must adhere to the regulation on large risks contained in the CRR, according to which the exposure contracted by an entity with a customer or group of associated customers will be considered a large exposure when its value is equal to or greater than 10% of eligible capital.
In addition, in order to limit large exposures, no entity may assume exposures exceeding 25% of its eligible capital with a single customer or group of associated customers, having factored in the credit risk mitigation effect contained in the regulation.
At the end of December, after applying risk mitigation techniques, no group reaches the above-mentioned thresholds.
Regulatory credit exposure with the 20 largest groups within the scope of large risks represented 5% of the outstanding credit risk with customers (lending to customers plus off-balance sheet risks) as of December 2021.
The detail, by activity and geographical area of the Group's risk concentration at 31 December 2021 is as follows: 2021.

Auditor's Consolidated Contents report financial statements 4.3. Sovereign risk and exposure to other public sector entities Sovereign risk occurs in transactions with a central bank. It includes the regulatory cash reserve, issuer risk with the Treasury (public debt portfolio) and risk from transactions with government institutions whose funding only come from the state’s budgetary revenue and not commercial operations.
The historic criteria of Grupo Santander can differ from regular EBA stress test standards. Though the EBA does include national, regional and local government institutions, it does not include deposits with central banks, exposures with insurance companies, indirect exposures via guarantees and other instruments.
Grupo Santander´s local sovereign exposure, in currencies other than the official currency of the country of issuance, is not significant ( EUR 10,013 million, 2.6% of total sovereign risk) according to our management criteria. Furthermore, exposure to non-local sovereign issuers involving cross-border risk 1 is even less significant (EUR 7,011 million, 1.8% of total sovereign risk).
Sovereign exposure in Latin America is mostly in local currency, and is recognised in the local accounts and concentrated in short- term maturities.
Over the past few years, total exposure to sovereign risk has remained in line with regulatory requirements and our strategy to manage this portfolio.
The shifts observed in the different countries exposure is due to our liquidity management strategy and the hedging of interest and exchange rates risks. Santander's exposure spreads among countries with varied macroeconomic outlooks and dissimilar scenarios in terms of growth, interest and exchange rates.
Our investment strategy for sovereign risk considers country’s credit quality to set the maximum exposure limits*: 2021 2020 2019.

TOTAL 13,780 62,326 42,914 — 119,020 129,923 5. Forborne loan portfolio Grupo Santander's internal forbearance policy acts as a reference for our subsidiaries locally. It shares the principles of regulations and supervisory expectations. It includes the requirements of the EBA guidelines on management of non performing and forborne exposures.
It defines forbearance as the modification of the payment conditions of a transaction to allow a customer experiencing financial difficulties (current or foreseeable) to fulfil their payment obligations. If forbearance is not allowed, there would be reasonable certainty that the customer would not be able to meet their financial obligations.
In addition, this policy also sets down rigorous criteria for evaluating, classifying and monitoring forbearances to ensure the strictest possible care and diligence in recovering due amounts. Thus, it dictates that we must adapt payment obligations to customers' current circumstances. Our forbearance policy also defines classification criteria to ensure we recognize risks appropriately. They must remain classified as non-performing or in watch-list for a prudential period for reasonable certainty of repayment.
Forbearances may never be used to delay the immediate recognition of losses or hinder the appropriate recognition of risk of default.
Total volume of forborne portfolio, at the end of December 2021, stood at EUR 36,042 million. After years of decreases due to the positive macroeconomic situation of the group's main geographies, the forborne stock remained practically flat in 2020. The portfolio increased by 24% in 2021, as a result of greater volume of forbearance carried out to attend to the needs of customers facing financial difficulties. In terms of credit quality, 43% of the loans is classified as doubtful, with a coverage ratio of 41%.
The following terms are used with the meanings specified below: • Refinancing transaction: transaction that is granted or used, for reasons relating to current or foreseeable financial difficulties of the borrower, to repay one or more of the transactions granted to it, or through which the payments on such transactions are brought fully or partially up to date, in order to enable the borrowers of the cancelled or refinanced transactions to repay their debt (principal and interest) because they are unable, or might foreseeably become unable, to comply with the conditions there of in due time and form.
• Restructured transaction: transaction with respect to which, for economic or legal reasons relating to current or foreseeable financial difficulties of the borrower, the financial terms and conditions are modified in order to facilitate the payment of the debt (principal and interest) because the borrower is unable, or might foreseeably become unable, to comply with the aforementioned terms and conditions in due time and form, even if such modification is envisaged in the agreement.

In 2021, the amortised cost of financial assets whose contractual cash flows were modified during the year when the corresponding loss adjustment was valued at an amount equal to the expected credit losses over the life of the asset amounted to EUR 2,480 million, without these modifications having a material impact on the income statement. Also, during 2021, the total of financial assets that have been modified since the initial recognition, and whose correction for expected loss has gone from being valued during the entire life of the asset to the following twelve months, amounts to EUR 1,868 million.
The transactions presented in the foregoing tables were classified at 31 December 2021 by nature, as follows: • Non-performing: Operations that rest on an inadequate payment scheme will be classified within the non-performing category, regardless they include contract clauses that delay the repayment of the operation throughout regular payments or present amounts written off the balance sheet for being considered irrecoverable.
• Performing: Operations not classifiable as non-performing will be classified within this category. Operations will also be classified as normal if they have been reclassified from the non-performing category for complying with the specific criteria detailed below: a) A period of a year must have passed from the refinancing or restructuring date.
b) The owner must have paid for the accrued amounts of the capital and interests, thus reducing the rearranged capital amount, from the date when the restructuring of refinancing operation was formalised.

Auditor's Consolidated Notes to the consolidated Contents report financial statements financial statements Appendix c) The owner must not have any other operation with amounts past due by more than 90 days on the date of the reclassification to the normal risk category.
Attending to the credit attention 57% of the forborne loan transactions are classified as other than non-performing. Particularly noteworthy are the level of existing guarantees (46% of transactions are secured by collateral) and the coverage provided by specific allowances (representing 23% of the total forborne loan portfolio and 41% of the non-performing portfolio).
c) Market, structural and liquidity risk 1. Activities subject to market risk and types of market risk Activities exposed to market risk encompass transactions where risk is assumed as a consequence of potential changes in interest rates, inflation rates, exchange rates, stock prices, credit spreads, commodity prices, volatility and other market factors; the liquidity risk from our products and markets, and the balance-sheet liquidity risk. Therefore, they include trading risks and structural risks.
◦ Interest rate risk arises from movements in interest rates that reduce the value of a financial instrument, a portfolio or the Grupo Santander. It can affect loans, deposits, debt securities, most assets and liabilities held for trading, and derivatives.
◦ Inflation rate risk arises from movements in inflation that can reduce the value of a financial instrument, a portfolio or the entire group. It can affect loans, debt securities and derivatives (e.g. inflation swaps and futures) whose profitability is linked to inflation.
◦ Exchange rate risk is the possibility of loss because the currency of a long or open position will depreciate against the base currency. It can affect debt in subsidiaries whose local currency is not the euro, as well as loans denominated in a foreign currency.
◦ Equity risk is the possibility of loss from open positions in securities if their market price or expected future dividends fall. It affects shares, stock market indices, convertible bonds and derivatives with shares as the underlying asset (put, call, equity swaps, etc.).
• Credit spread risk is the possibility of loss from open positions in fixed-income securities or credit derivatives if their yield curve, or the recovery rate of their issuer or type change. A spread is the yield difference between financial instruments against a benchmark (e.g. the internal rate of return (IRR) of government bonds and interbank interest rates).
• Commodity price risk is the possibility of loss from movements in commodity prices. Grupo Santander's commodity exposure is minor and stems mainly from commodity derivatives.
• Volatility risk is the possibility of loss caused by movements in interest rates, exchange rates, the stock market, credit spreads and other risk factors affecting portfolio value. It is inherent to all financial instruments whose value considers volatility (especially options contracts).
Derivative contracts (such as options, futures, forwards and swaps) can mitigate market risks partially or fully.
Additionally, other more complex hedging market risks are considered, such as correlation risk, market liquidity risk, prepayment or cancellation risk, and underwriting risk.
Balance sheet liquidity risk (unlike market liquidity risk) is the possibility of loss caused by forced disposal of assets or cash flow imbalance if the bank meets its payment obligations late or at excessive cost. It can cause losses by forced asset sales or impacts on margins due to the mismatch between expected cash inflows and outflows.
Pension and actuarial risks (explained at the end of this section) also depend on market variables.
Grupo Santander aim to comply with the Basel Committee’s Fundamental Review of the Trading Book (FRTB) and the EBA’s Guidelines on the management of interest rate risk arising from nontrading book activities. The purpose of several projects Grupo Santander runs is to provide risk control managers and teams with the best market risk management tools under the right governance framework for the models Grupo Santander uses for metric reporting; and to comply with regulation on the risks mentioned above.

IBOR Reform. 
Regulatory and supervisory context. 
In 2013, IOSCO published the Principles for Financial Benchmarks (IOSCO Principles) that establish standards for the development of benchmarks. Subsequently, the FSB established the Official Sector Steering Group (OSSG) for the application of the IOSCO Principles to the IBOR (Interbank Offered Rates) indices. Since then, the central banks and regulators of various jurisdictions have organized working groups to recommend alternative indices to indices such as the EONIA (Euro Overnight Index Average) and the LIBORs (London Interbank Offered Rates).
On 13 September 2018, the European Central Bank's working group recommended that the euro short-term interest rate (€STR) replace the EONIA. From 2 October 2019, the date on which the €STR was made available, the EONIA changed its methodology to be calculated as €STR plus a spread of 8.5 basis points. This change in the EONIA methodology was intended to facilitate the transition of the EONIA market to €STR before its definitive cessation on 3 January 2022.
On 5 March 2021, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) announced the final dates for the cessation of LIBORs: – On 31 December 2021, the publication of USD LIBOR (1 week and 2 months term), CHF LIBOR (all terms), GBP LIBOR (overnight term, 1 week, 2 months and 12 months), JPY LIBOR (overnight term, 1 week, 2 months, and 12 months) and EUR LIBOR (all terms).
– On 31 December 2021, the calculation methodology of some LIBORs was reformed to publish temporary synthetic LIBORs that became non-representative: GBP LIBOR (1-month, 3-month and 6month terms) and JPY LIBOR (1-month term, 3 months and 6 months).
– On 30 June 2023, the publication of the USD LIBOR will cease (overnight terms, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months).
In October 2020, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) launched the fallbacks Protocol and Supplement for IBORs (effective 25 January 2021), and provided market participants with of new derivatives fallbacks of LIBORs (among others IBOR, such as EURIBOR) for current derivative contracts and for new contracts. Additionally, on 19 August 2021, ISDA launched a new protocol that allowed entities to incorporate a fallback to the EONIA as the rate applicable to collateral in ISDA collateral agreements (known as CSAs). Banco Santander SA and various Santander Group entities have adhered to these protocols.
On December 2020, the Council of the European Union endorsed the modification of the EU Benchmark Regulation (BMR), giving the European Commission the power to establish a legislative solution that proposes a replacement rate to indices the cessation of which could cause a significant disturbance to the functioning of financial markets in the EU. In this context, on 14 and 21 October 2021, the European Commission published the Implementing Regulations regarding the designation of a substitute reference index for CHF LIBOR and EONIA.
Given the relevance of the IBOR indices, the volume of contracts and exposures is very high in the banking sector. Santander Group has a significant number of contracts linked to these interest rates. The most relevant are EURIBOR, EONIA, and LIBOR. These benchmarks are widely used, including derivative products, corporate loans, retail, discount products, deposits, repos, securities lending, collateral agreements, and floating rate notes, among others.
LIBOR and EONIA Reform. 
The main risks to which Santander is exposed arising from the transition of the EONIA and LIBORs are: (i) legal risks arising from potential changes in the documentation required for new or existing operations; (ii) financial and accounting risks derived from market risk models and from the valuation, coverage, cancellation and recognition of the financial instruments associated with the reference indices; (iii) business risk that revenues from LIBOR-linked products decline; (iv) pricing risks arising from how changes to benchmark indices could impact pricing mechanisms on some instruments; (v) operational risks arising from the potential requirement to adapt IT systems, trade reporting infrastructure and operational processes; (vi) conduct risks arising from the potential impact of communications with customers during the transition period and (vii) litigation risks regarding our existing products and services, which could adversely impact our profitability.
In order to monitor the risks and address the challenges of the transition, Santander launched the IBOR Transition Programme in 2019. The global program ensures that all affected business units and subsidiaries have a consistent understanding of the risks associated with the transition and can take appropriate steps to mitigate them.
This transition program incorporates the recommendations, guidelines and milestones defined by the regulators and working groups of the different jurisdictions. The structure of the program focuses on the following areas: Technology and Operations, Legal, Customer Relations, Risk Management and Models, Conduct and Communication, and Accounting and Finance.
During 2021, the IBOR Transition Program has focused on making all the contractual, commercial, operational and technological changes necessary to undertake the transition of the LIBOR and EONIA rates that have been discontinued in 2021. In 2022, the program will continue to attend to the next steps of the transition related to the management of the contract history and the milestone of the cessation of the LIBOR dollar of June 2023.
In addition, Grupo Santander continues to participate, throughout 2022, in the initiatives developed by the public and private sectors related to the reform of the interest rate reference indices.

Auditor's Consolidated Notes to the consolidated Contents report financial statements financial statements Appendix 3. Structural balance sheet risks 3.1. Main aggregates and variations Consistent with previous years, the market risk profile of Grupo Santander’s balance sheet remained moderate in 2021 in terms of asset, shareholders’ equity and NII volumes. Each subsidiary’s finance division manages interest rate risk from commercial banking and is responsible for handling structural risk from interest rate fluctuations.
To measure interest rate risk, Grupo Santander uses statistical models based on strategies to mitigate structural risk with interestrate instruments (such as bonds and derivatives) to keep risk profile within risk appetite.
The NII and EVE sensitivities below are based on scenarios of parallel interest rate movements from -100 to +100 basis points.
Structural VaR With such a homogeneous metric as VaR, we can fully monitor market risk in the banking book We differentiate fixed income based on interest rates and credit spreads in ALCO portfolios, FX rates and shares.

Structural interest rate risk • Europe. 
In general, the NII and EVE of Grupo Santander's main balance sheets (i.e. Santander España and Santander UK) show positive sensitivity to rising interest rates. Across our footprint, exposure was moderate in relation to annual budget and capital levels in 2021.
At the end of December 2021, under the scenarios previously described, the most significant NII sensitivity risk concentration in euros amounted to EUR 703 million; in pounds sterling, EUR 541 million; in Polish złoty EUR 65 million; and in the US dollar, EUR 54 million.
The most significant EVE risk concentration amounted to EUR 3,684 million; in the yield curve of the euro; of the pound sterling, EUR 1,056 million ; of the US dollar, EUR 221 million; and of the Polish zloty EUR 56 million, all relating to the interest rate cut risks.
• North America. 
In general, the NII and EVE of Grupo Santander's North American balance sheets tend to show positive sensitivity to rising interest rates. Exposure was moderate in relation to annual budget and capital levels in 2021.
At the end of December, the most significant risk to NII was mainly in the US and amounted to EUR 152 million.
• South America. 
The EVE and NII of our Grupo Santander's South American balance sheets are positioned for interest rate cuts.
Exposure in all countries was moderate in relation to the annual budget and capital levels in 2020.
In 2021, exposure was moderate in relation to annual budget and capital levels. At the end of December, the most significant risks to NII were mainly in Chile (EUR 86 million) and Brazil (EUR 83 million).
The most significant risks to EVE were recorded in Brazil (EUR 271 million) and Chile (EUR 258 million).
Structural foreign currency rate risk/results hedging Grupo Santander's structural FX risk stems mainly from the income and hedging of foreign currency transactions for permanent financial investments. In the dynamic management of this risk, Grupo Santander aims to limit the impact of FX rate movements on the core capital ratio. In 2021, the hedged of the different currencies that have an impact on our core capital ratio was close to 100%.

Auditor's Consolidated Notes to the consolidated Contents report financial statements financial statements Appendix. 
In December 2021, the permanent exposures (with potential impact on shareholders’ equity) were, from largest to smallest, in US dollars, British pounds sterling, Brazilian reais, Mexican pesos, Chilean pesos and Polish złoty.
Grupo Santander uses FX derivatives to hedge part of those permanent positions. The Finance division manages FX risk and hedging for the expected profits and dividends of subsidiaries whose base currency is not the euro.
Structural equity risk Grupo Santander holds equity positions in its banking and trading books. They are either equity instruments or stock, depending on the share of ownership or control.
By the end of December 2021, the equities and shareholdings in the banking book were diversified among Spain, China, Morocco, Poland and other countries. Most of them invest in the financial and insurance sectors. Grupo Santander has minor equity exposure to property and other sectors.
Structural equity positions are exposed to market risk. VaR is calculated for these positions with a set of market prices and proxies. At the end of December 2021, VaR at a 99% confidence level over a one day horizon was EUR 325 million (EUR 319 million and EUR 170 million at the end of 2020 and 2019, respectively).
3.2. Methodologies. 
Structural interest rate risk As part of structural risk, interest rate risk in the banking book (IRRBB) is the main source of balance sheet risk.
Grupo Santander measures the potential impact of interest rate movements on EVE and NII. Because changing rates may generate impacts, Grupo Santander must manage and control many subtypes of interest rate risk, such as repricing risk, curve risk, basis risk and option risk (e.g. behavioural or automatic). Interest rate risk in the balance sheet and market conditions and outlooks could necessitate certain financial measures to achieve Grupo Santander's desired risk profile (such as selling positions or setting interest rates on products we market). The metrics Grupo Santander uses to monitor IRRBB include NII and EVE sensitivity to interest rate movements.
• Net interest income sensitivity. 
Net interest income (NII) is the difference between interest income from assets and the interest cost of liabilities in the banking book over a typical one- to three-year horizon (one year being standard in Grupo Santander). Because NII sensitivity is the difference in income between a selected scenario and the base scenario, its values can be as many as considered scenarios. It enables us to see short-term risks and supplement economic value of equity (EVE) sensitivity.
• Economic value of equity sensitivity. 
Economic value of equity (EVE) is the difference between the current value of all assets minus the current value of all liabilities in the banking book. It does not include shareholders’ equity and noninterest-bearing instruments. Because EVE sensitivity is the difference in EVE between a selected scenario and the base scenario, it can have as many values as considered scenarios. It enables us to see long-term risks and supplement NII sensitivity.
Structural exchange-rate risk/hedging of results Every day, Grupo Santander measures FX positions, VaR and P/L.
Structural equity risk Grupo Santander measures equity positions, VaR and P/L.
4. Liquidity risk Structural liquidity management aims to fund the Group’s recurring activity optimising maturities and costs, while avoiding taking on undesired liquidity risks.
Santander’s liquidity management is based on the following principles: • Decentralised liquidity model.
• Medium- and long-term (M/LT) funding needs must be covered by medium- and long-term instruments.
• High contribution from customer deposits due to the retail nature of the balance sheet.
• Diversification of wholesale funding sources by instruments/ investors, markets/currencies and maturities.
• Limited recourse to short-term funding.
• Availability of sufficient liquidity reserves, including standing facilities/discount windows at central banks to be used in adverse situations.
• Compliance with regulatory liquidity requirements both at Group and subsidiary level, as a new factor conditioning management.
The effective application of these principles by all institutions comprising the Group required the development of a unique management framework built upon three fundamental pillars: • A solid organisational and governance model that ensures the involvement of the subsidiaries’ senior management in decisiontaking and its integration into the Group’s global strategy. The decision-making process for all structural risks, including liquidity and funding risk, is carried out by local Asset and Liability Committees (ALCOs) in coordination with the global ALCO, which is the body empowered by the Bank's board in accordance with the corporate Asset and Liability Management (ALM) framework.
This governance model has been reinforced as it has been included within Santander's Risk Appetite Framework. This framework meets demands from regulators and market players emanating from the financial crisis to strengthen banks’ risk management and control systems.
• In-depth balance sheet analysis and measurement of liquidity risk, supporting decision-taking and its control. The objective is to ensure the Group maintains adequate liquidity levels necessary to cover its short- and long-term needs with stable funding sources, optimising the impact of their costs on the income statement. Grupo Santander’s liquidity risk management processes are contained within a conservative risk appetite framework established in each geographic area in accordance with its commercial strategy. This risk appetite establishes the limits within which the subsidiaries can operate in order to achieve their strategic objectives.
Annual report 2021 761


 

 

 

 

 


Auditor's Consolidated Notes to the consolidated Contents report financial statements financial statements Appendix • Management adapted in practice to the liquidity needs of each business. Every year, based on business needs, a liquidity plan is developed which seeks to achieve: • a solid balance sheet structure, with a diversified presence in the wholesale markets; • the use of liquidity buffers and limited encumbrance of assets; • compliance with both regulatory metrics and other metrics included in each entity’s risk appetite statement.
Over the course of the year, all dimensions of the plan are monitored.
Grupo Santander continues to develop the ILAAP (Internal Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Process), an internal self-assessment of liquidity adequacy which must be integrated into the Group’s other risk management and strategic processes. It focuses on both quantitative and qualitative matters and is used as an input to the SREP (Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process). The ILAAP evaluates the liquidity position both in ordinary and stressed scenarios.
i. Liquidity risk measurement Grupo Santander measures liquidity risk with tools and metrics that account for the appropriate risk factors.
a) Liquidity buffer The liquidity buffer is the total liquid assets a bank has to cope with cash outflows during periods of stress. The assets are free of encumbrances and can be used immediately to generate liquidity without losses or excessive discounts. The liquidity buffer is a tool for calculating most liquidity metrics. It is also a metric with defined limits for each subsidiary.
b) Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) The liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) is a regulatory metric. Its purpose is to promote the short-term resilience of a bank’s liquidity profile and make sure it has enough high-quality liquid assets to withstand a considerable idiosyncratic or market stress scenario over 30 calendar days.
c) Wholesale liquidity metric The wholesale liquidity metric measures the number of days Grupo Santander would survive if it used liquid assets to cover lost liquidity from a wholesale deposit run-off (without possible renewal) over a set time horizon. Grupo Santander also uses it as an internal shortterm liquidity metric to reduce risk from dependence on wholesale funding.
d) Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) The net stable funding ratio (NSFR) is a regulatory metric we use to measure long-term liquidity risk. It is the ratio of available stable funding to required stable funding. It requires banks to keep a robust balance sheet, with off-balance-sheet assets and operations financed by stable liabilities.
e) Asset Encumbrance metrics Grupo Santander calculates two metrics to measure asset encumbrance risk. On the one hand, the asset encumbrance ratio gives the proportion of encumbered assets to total assets; on the other, the structural asset encumbrance ratio gives the proportion of encumbered assets by structural funding transaction (namely longterm collateralized issues and credit transactions with central banks).
f) Other additional liquidity indicators In addition to traditional tools to measure short and long-term liquidity and funding risk, Grupo Santander has a set of additional liquidity indicators to complement those and to measure other noncovered liquidity risk factors. These include concentration metrics, such as the main and the five largest funding counterparties, or the distribution of funding by maturity.
In addition, we calculate a number of metrics on the institution’s ability to generate liquidity through collateralized financing, such as overcollateralization, eligibility ratios assets without charges and deadlines for their placement.
g) Liquidity scenario analysis As liquidity stress tests, four standard scenarios have been defined: i. An idiosyncratic scenario of events detrimental only to Santander; ii. a local market scenario of events highly detrimental to a base country’s financial system or real economy; iii.a global market scenario of events highly detrimental to the global financial system; and iv.combined scenario consisting of a combination of more severe idiosyncratic and market events (local and global) occurring simultaneously and interactively.
Grupo Santander uses these stress test outcomes as tools to determine risk appetite and support business decision-making.
h) Liquidity early warning indicators The system of early warning indicators (EWI) consists of quantitative and qualitative liquidity indicators that help predict stress situations and weaknesses in the funding and liquidity structure of Grupo Santander entities. External indicators relate to market-based financial variables; internal indicators relate to our own performance.
i) Intraday liquidity metrics Grupo Santander follows Basel regulation and calculates several metrics and stress scenarios for intraday liquidity risk to maintain a high level of control.
ii. Liquidity coverage ratio and net stable financing ratio As regards the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR), the regulatory requirement for this ratio, set at 100%, has been at its maximum level since 2018.
Below is a breakdown of the composition of the Group's liquid assets under the criteria set out in the supervisory prudential reporting (Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2017/2114 of 9 November 2017) for the determination of high quality liquid assets for the calculation of the LCR ratio (HQLA):

In relation to the net stable funding ratio (NSFR), its definition was approved by the Basel Committee in October 2014. The transposition of this requirement to the European regulation took place in June 2019 with the publication in the Official Gazette of the European Union of Regulation (EU) 2019/876 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2019. The Regulation establishes that entities must have a net stable financing ratio, as defined in the Regulation, higher 100% from June 2021. For this reason, the figures for 2019 and 2020 for this ratio are calculated using the Basel methodology, while those for 2021 already include the requirement as transposed into European regulations.

As regards the funding structure, given the predominantly commercial nature of the Group's balance sheet, the loan portfolio is mainly financed by customer deposits. Note 22) 'Debt securities' shows the composition of these liabilities on the basis of their nature and classification, the movements and maturity profile of the debt securities issued by the Group, reflecting the strategy of diversification by products, markets, issuers and maturities followed by the Group in its approach to the wholesale markets.
iii. Asset encumbrance In accordance with the guidelines established by the European Banking Authority (EBA) in 2014 on committed and uncommitted assets, the concept of assets committed in financing transactions (asset encumbrance) includes both on-balance sheet assets provided as collateral in transactions to obtain liquidity and off-balance sheet assets that have been received and reused for similar purposes, as well as other assets associated with liabilities for reasons other than financing.

On-balance-sheet encumbered assets amounted to EUR 365,100 million, of which 72% are loans (mortgage loans, corporate loans, etc.). Guarantees received committed amounted to EUR 80,800 million, relating mostly to debt securities received as security in asset purchase transactions and re-used.
Taken together, these two categories represent a total of EUR 445,900 million of encumbered assets, which give rise to EUR 325,200 million matching liabilities.
As of December 2021, total asset encumbrance in funding operations represented 26.1% of the Group’s extended balance sheet under EBA criteria (total assets plus guarantees received: EUR 1,708,000 million as of December 2021). This percentage has decreased from 26.6% that presented the Group as of December 2020, mainly as a result of the increase in the balance sheet.
d) Capital risk. 
In the second line of defence, capital risk management can independently challenge business and first-line activities by: • Supervising capital planning and adequacy exercises through a review of the main components affecting the capital ratios.
• Identifying key metrics to calculate the Group’s regulatory capital, setting tolerance levels and analysing significant variations, as well as single transactions with impact on capital.
• Reviewing and challenging the execution of capital actions proposed in line with capital planning and risk appetite.
Grupo Santander commands a sound solvency position, above the levels required by regulators and by the European Central bank.
Regulatory capital. 
At 1 January 2022, at a consolidated level, the Group must maintain a minimum capital ratio of 8.85% of CET1 (4.50% being the requirement for Pillar I, 0.84% being the requirement for Pillar 2R (requirement), 2.50% being the requirement for capital conservation buffer, 1.00% being the requirement for G-SIB and 0.01% being the requirement for anti-cyclical capital buffer).
Grupo Santander must also maintain a minimum capital ratio of 10.64% of tier 1 and a minimum total ratio of 13.01%.

Leverage ratio Basel III established the leverage ratio as a non-risk sensitive measure aimed at limiting excessive balance sheet growth relative to available capital.
The Group performs the calculation in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2019/876 of 20 May 2019 amending Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 as regards the leverage ratio.
This ratio is calculated as tier 1 capital divided by leverage exposure. Exposure is calculated as the sum of the following items: • Accounting assets, excluding derivatives and items treated as deductions from tier 1 capital (for example, the balance of loans is included, but not that of goodwill) further excluding the exposures referred to in Article 429a(1) of the regulation.
• Off-balance-sheet items (mainly guarantees, unused credit limits granted and documentary credits) weighted using credit conversion factors.
• Inclusion of net value of derivatives (gains and losses are netted with the same counterparty, minus collaterals if they comply with certain criteria) plus a charge for the future potential exposure.
• A charge for the potential risk of security funding transactions.
• Lastly, it includes a charge for the risk of credit derivative swaps (CDS).

Auditor's Consolidated Notes to the consolidated Contents report financial statements financial statements Appendix. 
With the publication of Regulation (EU) 2019/876 of 20 May, 2019, amending Regulation (EU) n.º 575/2013 as regards the leverage ratio, the final calibration of the ratio is set at 3% for all entities and, for systemic entities G-SIB, an additional surcharge is also established which will be 50% of the cushion ratio applicable to the EISM. In addition, modifications are included in its calculation, including the exclusion of certain exposures from the total exposure measure: public loans, transfer loans and officially guaranteed export credits.
Banks implemented this final definition of the leverage ratio in June 2021, however, the new calibration of the ratio (the additional surcharge for G-SIBs) will take effect from January 2023.

Global systemically important banks Grupo Santander is one of 30 banks designated as global systemically important banks (G-SIBs).
The designation as a systemically important entity is based on the measurement set by regulators (the FSB and BCBS), based on 5 criteria (size, cross-jurisdictional activity, interconnectedness with other financial institutions, substitutability and complexity).
This definition means it has to fulfil certain additional requirements, which consist mainly of a capital buffer -1%, in TLAC requirements (total loss absorbing capacity), that we have to publish relevant information more frequently than other banks, greater regulatory requirements for internal control bodies, special supervision and drawing up of special reports to be submitted to supervisors.
The fact that Grupo Santander has to comply with these requirements makes it a more solid bank than its domestic rivals.

Appendix VI. 
Annual banking report Grupo Santander’s total tax contribution (taxes incurred directly and by third parties, generated in the course of business) is around EUR 16,200 million, including more than EUR 7,600 million in taxes incurred directly (corporate income tax, non-recoverable VAT and other indirect taxes, employer Social Security contributions, payroll taxes and other taxes and levies).
This report complies with Article 89 of Directive 2013/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on access to the activity of credit institutions and the prudential supervision of credit institutions and investment firms, and its transposition into Spanish law pursuant to Article 87 of Act 10/2014 of 26 June on the regulation, supervision and capital adequacy of credit institutions.
The criteria used to prepare this report were: a) Name(s), activities and location Appendices I to III to the consolidated financial statements contain details of the companies operating in each jurisdiction, including their name(s), location and activities.
Santander main activity in the jurisdictions where operate is commercial banking. The Group primarily operates in ten markets through subsidiaries that are autonomous in capital and liquidity. This has clear strategic and regulatory advantages, since it limits the risk of contagion between units, imposes a double layer of global and local oversight, and facilitates crisis management and resolution.
b) Turnover and profit or loss before tax Turnover in this report is Total income, and profit or loss before tax, Operating profit/(loss) before tax, both as defined and presented in the consolidated income statement that forms part of the consolidated financial statements.
c) Number of full time equivalent employees The data on full-time equivalent employees stem from the average headcount of each jurisdiction.
d) Tax on profit or loss In the absence of specific criteria, we have included the amount effectively paid (EUR 4,012 million in 2021, with an effective tax rate of 27.6%) in respect of taxes whose effect is recognized under Income tax in the consolidated income statement.
Taxes effectively paid by the companies in each jurisdiction include: • Supplementary payments relating to income tax returns, usually for prior years.
• Advances, prepayments, withholdings made or borne in respect of tax on profit or loss for the year. We included taxes borne abroad in the jurisdiction of the company that bore them.
• Refunds received with respect to prior years’ returns.
• Where appropriate, the amount payable from assessments and litigation relating to these taxes.
The foregoing form part of the cash flow statement and differ from the corporate income tax expense recognized in the consolidated income statement (EUR 4,894 million in 2021, representing an effective rate of 33.6%, or, discounting extraordinary results, EUR 5,076 million, which represents an effective rate of 33.3%, see note 27 and 51.c). This is because each country’s tax regulations establish: • when taxes must be paid. There is often a mismatch between the payment dates and the generation of the income bearing the tax.
• their own calculation criteria to define temporary or permanent restrictions on expense deduction, exemptions and relief or deferrals of certain income, generating the differences between the accounting profit (or loss) and taxable profit (or tax loss) which is ultimately taxed; tax loss carry forwards from prior years, tax credits and/or relief, etc., must also be added. In certain cases, special regimes such as the tax consolidation of companies in the same jurisdiction are established.
e) Public subsidies In the context of the legally-required disclosures, this was interpreted as any aid or subsidy in line with the European Commission’s Guidance on the notion of State aid. Grupo Santander did not receive public subsidies in 2021.
