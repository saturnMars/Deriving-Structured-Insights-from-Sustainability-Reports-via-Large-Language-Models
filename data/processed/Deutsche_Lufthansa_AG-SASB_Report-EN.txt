TR-AL-110a.1 Gross global Scope 1 emissions. 
Gross global Scope 1 emissions: 13.8 million tonnes, (2020: 11.5 million tonnes), thereof 13,7 million tonnes caused by flights of Lufthansa Group aircraft. 
Specific CO₂ emissions per freight tonne-kilometre were reduced by 1% to 869 grammes (2020: 880 grammes)
Specific CO₂ emissions per passenger-kilometre were 3% lower than in the previous year at 101.6 grammes (2020: 105.2 grammes)
The decline in the Group fleet’s specific consumption compared with the previous period was mainly due to changes in the route network and the resulting increase in average flight length. 
Scope 1 data audited with high assurance by Müller-
BBM, Cert GmbH according to GHG Protocol, ISO 14064-1 and 14064-3.

Discussion of longterm and short-term strategy or plan to manage Scope 1 emissions, emissions reduction targets, and an analysis of performance against those targets. 
Lufthansa Group played a major role in setting ambitious climate related targets within the national and international airline associations of which the. 
Lufthansa Group is a member. In October 2021 the. 
International Air Transport Association (IATA) adopted a resolution for global aviation that commits the global aviation sector (IATA member airlines) to reducing its net carbon emissions to zero by 2050.
This commitment is in line with the goal of the Paris. 
Climate Agreement to limit global warming to significantly below 2 degrees Celsius. Via the. 
European airline association Airlines for Europe (A4E), the Lufthansa Group is also involved in the. 
Destination 2050 study – an initiative by five. 
European air transport associations (A4E, ACI. 
EUROPE, ASD, CANSO and ERA) which began in summer 2019. As aviation is generally considered an industry that is “difficult to decarbonise”, the aim of this study was to examine emission reduction potentials, taking into account the current state of the art and science. The focus is on significant reductions by 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. The aim is to never exceed the level of emissions recorded in 2019.

Lufthansa Group’s CO2 targets beyond IATA industry’s goals.
As befits its pioneering role, the Lufthansa Group has also defined its own carbon reduction targets, which in some cases are more demanding. This means the. 
Lufthansa Group’s net carbon footprint should be reduced by half by 2030 compared with 2019, with carbon neutrality the objective for 2050.
In November 2021, the Lufthansa Group further specified its emission reduction targets, made a commitment to science-based targets and submitted an application for validation of these reduction targets for 2030 in accordance with the. 
Aviation Sector Guidance of the Science-based. 
Targets Initiative (SBTi). This initiative has defined science based targets based on a remaining carbon budget.

 independent experts audit the safety standards applied Group-wide in an IATA Operational Safety. 
Audit (IOSA). All Group airlines fully apply the internationally accepted IATA standards for air safety. These external benchmarks are supplemented by the Lufthansa Group with internal guidelines, in particular the Executive Board’s Safety Commitment.
These guidelines are compiled in the Lufthansa. 
Group Safety Management Manual (SMM) and are additionally included in handbooks concerning flight operations, training, maintenance and ground handling services on airline level. The Executive. 
Board and all managers and employees affected by operator regulations fulfill their tasks in accordance with the SMM.
Within the Lufthansa Group, independent departments monitor compliance with regulations and processes related to flight operations. At every. 
Group airline, the safety management system is the responsibility of a designated safety manager. The safety manager reports both to the airline’s management and to the Group Safety Pilot, who has. 
Group-wide responsibility for evaluating and developing procedures and standards relevant to flight safety. He reports directly to the Chairman of the Executive Board and CEO of Deutsche Lufthansa.
