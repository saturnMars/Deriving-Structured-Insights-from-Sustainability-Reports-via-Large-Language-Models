Introduction. 
This document, which together with Eni for - A Just Transition and Eni for - Carbon neutrality by 2050, is part of Eni’s voluntary sustainability reporting, aims to represent the Group's non-financial performance, highlighting the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) related to the fiveyear period 2017-2021 for the three levers of Eni's integrated business model – Carbon Neutrality by 2050, Operational Excellence and Alliances for Development – whose objective is the creation of long-term value for all stakeholders. Eni is committed to contributing, directly or indirectly, to the achievement of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by seizing new business opportunities, supporting a socially just energy transition (Just Transition), which guarantees access to efficient and sustainable energy and achieving the goal of net zero emissions by 2050 with the aim of sharing social and economic benefits with workers, the value chain, communities and customers in an inclusive, transparent and socially equitable manner, i.e., taking into consideration the different levels of development of the countries in which it operates, minimizing existing inequalities. In this contest, business management can be measured by means of non-financial indicators which, in a process of continuous improve- ment, provide guidance in setting out future strategies and goals. Therefore, the development of a specific document to describe non-financial performance and the evolution of its transformation path aims at ensuring transparency with regard to Eni’s operations in order to be able to maintain a constructive and proactive dialogue with its stakeholders. The document, as well as the Consolidated Non-Financial Statement1, is prepared in accordance with the international reference standards for non-financial reporting: the Sustainability Reporting Standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and, in continuity with last year, the “Core" metrics defined by the World Economic Forum (WEF) in the White Paper "Measuring Stakeholder Capitalism Towards Common Metrics and Consistent Reporting of Sustainable Value Creation" have been included. This framework aims to define common metrics for the creation of long-term value and to further promote the convergence of ESG standards and principles. In addition, two reference tables are shown: one with the metrics provided by the Exploration & Production standard of SASB2, the other containing the indicators required by the EU Sustainable Finance Disclosure. 
Regulation (SFDR). Both will be published on Eni.com for possible updates throughout the year.

ENI’S NON-FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS The UN’s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, presented in New York in September 2015, identifies 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that represent common goals for the current complex social challenges and are an important reference for the international community. As part of these global challenges, energy plays a fundamental role in the satisfaction of the primary needs for the socio-economic development of countries and the protection of the environment and international security. Aware of this, Eni, in its Four-Year and Long-Term Strategic Plan, has defined objectives that contribute to achieving the SDGs and are measured through specific KPIs reported in this document3. In this way, Eni addresses its own business and is able to seize new opportunities, highlighting both the value generated and the mitigation actions of the negative impacts that may be caused by the business itself.

4) Eni’s company By-Laws ensure that the number of representatives of minorities exceeds the number required by law. 5) This consists of the assessment by each Board Member of the contributions made by each other Board Member.
Governance and business ethics. 
The Board of Directors (BoD) and the Board of Statutory Auditors (BoSA) are appointed by the Shareholders’ Meeting using the slate voting system; their respective chairmen are elected by the Shareholders’ Meeting with simple majorities. Three directors and two auditors, including the Chairman of the Board of Statutory Auditors, were elected by non-controlling shareholders4. The current BoD was appointed by the Shareholders’ Meeting held on May 13, 2020. To appoint the Directors, the Shareholders’ Meeting took into account the advice promptly communicated to the market by the BoD previously in office on the best composition in terms of diversity, such as gender, professionalism, experience and ex- pertise, also including the company's strategies, transformation, and energy transition path. The result is, therefore, a balanced and well-diversified Board of Directors, where more than 44% of its members and 40% of the Board of Statutory Auditors' members, including the Chairs, are women. Following the integration of the CS at the Shareholders' Meeting of May 12, 2021, the percentage of female members in the body increased to 60%. The number of independent Directors on the BoD exceeds the number required by the By-Laws and by the law. Every year, the BoD, with the assistance of an external consultant and assisted by the Nomination Committee, carries out a self-assessment (Board Review). Essential elements of this review are comparisons with best practices at national and international level, and a review of Board dynamics, also evaluating whether to carry out a Peer Review of directors, which was actually carried out in 20215. In line with the procedure launched several years ago, at the start of the new term of office, training sessions were carried out in support of the Board of Directors and the Board of Statutory Auditors on institutional, business and sustainability issues. To support the Board of Directors and the Board of Statutory Auditors, Eni has for several years been running a training programme (Board Induction), based on presentations of Eni's activities and organisation.

by top management. During 2020 and 2021, a number of induction sessions open to Directors and Statutory Auditors were held, as part of meetings of both the Board of Directors and the Board of Statutory Auditors and Board Committees, on issues relating to the corporate structure and its business model, Eni's mission and decarbonisation path, the environmental and social sustainability of Eni's activities, governance, compliance, the Internal Control and Risk Management system, accounting and tax issues, remuneration policy and human capital. Training continues throughout the term of office with ongoing training sessions. The internal regulations on the “Corporate Governance of Eni companies”, subject to the requirements of the law, provide that in selecting the members of the management and control bodies of Eni’s Italian and foreign subsidiaries, the need for diversity (including gender diversity) is, where possible, taken into account. In line with these regulations, Eni’s commitment to favouring the presence of women in the management and in control bodies of Eni’s companies is consistent. The overall percentage of women on the control bodies of subsidiaries increased to 43% (37% in 2020), while the overall percentage of women on the management bodies of subsidiaries decreased slightly compared to the past to 24% in 2021 (26% in 2020).
REMUNERATION The variable remuneration of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) for the 2020-2023 term of office, in both its short and long-term components, reflects a greater focus on sustainability objectives with particular reference to the issues of decarbonisation and energy transition, in line with Eni's strategic commitment to reducing its carbon footprint, which is part of the company's essential goals. In particular, the 2020-2022 LongTerm Stock-based Incentive Plan provides for a specific objective (total weight 35%), based on the indicators related to the decarbonisation and energy transition processes and circular economy projects, in line with the objectives communicated to the market and with the aim of aligning with the interests of all stakeholders. Starting in 2021, the Short-Term Variable Incentive Plan, in addition to the environmental sustainability targets (GHG emissions intensity, with a weight of 12.5%) and human capital targets (Severity Incident Rate, with a weight of 12.5%), envisages replacing the target on exploration resources with the target of increasing installed capacity from renewable sources (with a weight of 12.5%). In addition, the upstream GHG emissions intensity target has been extended to indirect Scope 2 emissions and to non-operated assets for both the Long-term and Short-term Plans. These objectives are also set out for senior managers with strategic responsibilities and for other managerial resources, together with other sustainability objectives (e.g. relating to human rights or local development projects) in line with the role covered and with the provisions of the Strategic Plan. The following table shows, for the current and previous term of office: (i) the percentage of variable remuneration linked to long-term objectives with respect to total remuneration; (ii) the percentage of short-term and longterm variable remuneration linked to sustainability objectives with respect to total variable remuneration, calculated by target and maximum level of sustainability performance within an overall target level of performance.

Research and development. 
Eni’s Research and Technological Innovation are key elements to make effective and efficient access to new energy resources and improve the use of existing ones, while reducing the impact on the environment. With this in mind, the aim is to leverage the expertise of all areas of the company, in a cross-cutting and synergic manner, in order to extract even more value from skills, directing them towards the challenges of the energy transition. The objectives are, therefore, declined on the following strategic directives, defined as technology platforms: • PROCESS DECARBONISATION with the aim of reducing, capturing, transforming or storing CO2 by increasing energy efficiency, reducing emissions and promoting energy carriers with a low carbon footprint; • CIRCULAR AND BIO-PRODUCTS: with the aim of reducing, recycling and reusing products and by-products, turning waste into added value products for biorefining, sustainable mobility and green chemistry; • RENEWABLES AND NEW ENERGIES: with the aim of supporting the development of renewable energy and energy storage solutions, and developing breakthrough energy technologies such as magnetic confinement fusion; • OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE: with the aim of developing technologies that ensure the highest level of efficiency and safety, and the lowest environmental impact, while reducing the costs and time-to-market of our business activities. Compared to the previous strategic plan, expenses linked to the development of R&D projects have increased significantly, from €787 million to €811 million. Efforts are being made to develop technologies to reduce CO2 capture costs and optimise processes for its transformation into added value products; technologies that enable better management of conventional assets, including those aimed at the evolution of the downstream business, with an emphasis on processes that enable the expansion of the type of biofeedstock to be processed in the refinery, or processes for the production of advanced fuels from waste from other processes. To expand the theme of the circular economy, much attention is paid to the chemical and mechanical recycling of plastics and the production of chemicals from renewable sources. In the field of electrification technologies, actions continue to guarantee the development of renewable energies (e.g. ISWEC, for generating electricity using wave power) and energy storage. In 2021, the estimated tangible value generated was 1,253 million euros, a marked increase compared 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 SDGs - target.

with 2020, due to the gradual recovery of post-pandemic industrial activities and the positive contribution made by higher hydrocarbon prices. In the upstream sector, technologies that increase the operational and energy efficiency of operations, such as hardware and software to improve the ability to describe the subsurface or the monitoring and asset integrity of plants, have played a central role. In the downstream area, feedstock optimisation for biorefineries, the licensing of proprietary EST technology and pipeline control technologies have made a contribution. With regard to Intellectual Property management in support of technological innovation, in 2021 a total of 30 new patent applications were filed, generated by internal R&D activities and by the external network of cooperation. There were 11 new patent applications directly targeted at developing technologies in the field of renewable sources (biofuels, solar, wave energy and green chemistry). In addition to patent applications, a further intellectual property right was generated through copyright protection of software (1) relating to algorithms supporting drilling operations. The overall figure, which is an increase compared to 2020, apart from its physiological variability, reflects the partial recovery of both internal and external experimental activities compared to 2020, which had suffered from the heavy impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the forced lockdown. The decrease in the total number of rights in the portfolio (7,290 compared to 7,471 in 2020 and 7,686 in 2019) and the decrease in the average age (8.89 years compared to 9.22 years in 2020 and 9.80 years in 2019) are the result of the periodic review of the Group's patent portfolio, aimed at improving its alignment with the industrial and business policies of Eni and its subsidiaries.

Eni has historically been committed to reducing its direct GHG emissions and was among the first in the industry to define, starting in 20157, a series of objectives aimed at improving performance related to GHG emissions from operated assets, with specific indicators that illustrate the progress achieved to date in terms of reducing GHG emissions into the atmosphere. These were joined in 2020 by indicators accounted for on an equity basis, which trace Eni's path towards the 2050 net zero objective through specific short and medium/long-term targets: Net Zero Carbon Footprint Upstream by 2030: the indicator considers Scope 1+2 emissions from all upstream assets, operated by Eni and by third parties, net of offsets mainly from Natural Climate Solutions. In 2021, the indicator remained substantially stable as the slight increase in emissions due to emergency outages in Nigeria and Angola and the resumption of onshore activities in Libya, was balanced by increased offsetting through forestry credits for 2 MtCO2eq.
Net Zero Carbon Footprint Eni by 2035: the indicator considers Scope 1+2 emissions from activities carried out by Eni and third parties, net of offsets, mainly from Natural Climate Solutions. In 2021, the indicator is substantially stable as the slight increase in emissions, in line with the trend of the Upstream indicator, was balanced by increased compensation through forestry credits for 2 MtCO2eq. Net Zero GHG Lifecycle Emissions by 2050: the indicator refers to all Scope 1, 2 and Scope 3 emissions associated with Eni activities and energy products, along their value chain, net of offsets, mainly from Natural Climate Solutions. In 2021, it increased mostly in relation to the resumption of activities following the health emergency and greater sales of oil & gas retail products. Net Zero Carbon Intensity by 2050: the indicator is calculated as the ratio between absolute net GHG emissions (Scopes 1, 2 and 3) along the value chain of energy products and the amount of energy they contain. In 2021 it decreased by 2% compared to 2020 thanks to the increase of the gas share in the energy mix and the role of offsets. With specific reference to shortterm decarbonisation targets, defined on operated assets and accounted for on a 100% basis, the following is a summary of the results obtained in 2021 and the progress towards defined targets. In 2021, the Renewables business grew significantly, reaching an installed capacity from renewable sources of 1,188 MW (more than triple the result for 2020). This acceleration, obtained mainly as a result of the recent acquisitions in Europe and the United States, has also been carried out with the broader perspective of integration with Plenitude's retail business, in order to exploit all the possible synergies between the two businesses.
With specific reference to the short-term decarbonization objectives, defined for the assets operated and accounted for at 100%, a summary of the results achieved in 2021 and the state of progress against the targets is provided.

Reduction of upstream GHG emission intensity index by 43% by 2025 vs. 2014: the upstream GHG intensity index, expressed as the ratio between direct Scope 1 emissions in tonnes of CO2eq and gross production in thousands of barrels of oil equivalent, was substantially stable in 2021 compared to the previous year. The index performance correlates with an increase in emissions mainly related to emergency shutdowns in Nigeria and Angola and the resumption of onshore activities in Libya. The effect was partially offset by a reduction in fugitive emissions, thanks to monitoring and maintenance activities, and a general optimisation of consumption. In 2021, the index recorded a value of 20.2 tonnes of CO2eq/mgl boe, up 1% from 2020. The overall reduction compared to 2014 was 25%. Zero routine gas flaring by 2025 in upstream assets: in 2021, hydrocarbon volumes sent for routine flaring amounted to 1.16 billion Sm3, up 12% from 2020, mainly due to the resumption of operations at the Abu-Attifel and El Feel facilities in Libya, which were closed for most of 2020. Reduction of upstream methane leakage by 80% by 2025 vs. 2014: in 2021 upstream methane fugitive emissions were 9.2 ktCH4, a reduction of 18% compared to 2020 due to monitoring and maintenance carried out as part of the periodic Leak Detection And Repair (LDAR) campaigns. The overall reduction compared to 2014 was 92%, confirming achievement – as early as 2019 – of the 80% reduction target set for 2025. An average improvement of 2% per year in 2021 compared to the 2014 Carbon Efficiency Index: the target extends the GHG reduction commitment (Scope 1 and Scope 2) to all business areas with an overall Eni index. In 2021, the index was 32 tonnes of CO2eq/mgl boe, slightly higher than in 2020, mainly due to the resumption of activities, which are not yet fully operational. This effect was partially offset by the energy efficiency projects launched or completed during the year. Reported below are the trends of the other main Eni and sector indicators, which, although not subject to specific targets, contribute to the performance of the indices described above. Overall, direct GHG emissions deriving from the assets operated by Eni in 2021 amounted to 40.1 million tons of CO2eq, up 6% compared to 2020, mainly due to the resumption of activities in the upstream and gas transport, power and chemicals sectors. Indirect GHG Scope 2 emissions increased by 11% in 2021 compared to 2020, mainly due to increased steam purchases in the chemicals sector. These emissions are related to the purchase of energy from third parties for the consumption of the operated assets and are marginal for Eni as electricity is generated mainly through its own installations. Indirect GHG Scope 3 emissions are accounted for in accordance with IPIECA guidelines, which require an activity-based analysis. Among these, GHG emissions related to the final consumption of the products sold (so-called Scope 3, end-use category) form the largest contribution, and are calculated on the basis of upstream production in equity share. These emissions form part of the Scope 3 end-use emissions considered in the Net GHG Lifecycle Emissions and Net Carbon Intensity indica- tors. In particular they represent the emissions (accounted for on an equity basis) from end users from Eni's predominant supply chain, i.e. the upstream supply chain. They decreased by 5% in 2021 compared to 2020 due to the reduction in hydrocarbon production sold by the upstream business and assumptions on the use of petroleum products8. For the other Scope 3 emission categories, the trend is broadly constant over the 2016-2020 period. Exploration & Production. Direct GHG emissions (Scope 1) from operated assets are up 6% mainly due to the resumption of onshore activities in Libya and emergency shutdowns in Nigeria and Angola. Global Gas & LNG Portfolio. Direct GHG emissions (Scope 1) have increased sharply in 2021 (1.01 in 2021 vs. 0.36 in 2020) in relation to the increase in gas volumes transported by the Sergaz pipelines and the consolidation of the Damietta liquefaction plant (Segas). Refining & Marketing and Chemicals. Direct GHG emissions (Scope 1) are essentially stable compared to 2020. The slight increase of 1% is linked to the resumption of activities in the chemicals sector, following the shutdowns of some plants in 2020. Direct GHG emissions (Scope 1)/ input processed quantities (raw and semi-finished materials) from refineries are improving compared to 2021, with an 8% reduction reflecting the increase in the quantity of processed material. Eni Power & Renewables. Direct GHG emissions (Scope 1) increased by 4% compared to 2020, in line with the trend in electricity production, which increased as a result of production declines in 2020 in relation to the health emergency.

Direct GHG emissions (Scope 1)/ equivalent electricity produced (EniPower): decreased slightly compared to 2020 (-3%). The gap is linked to the lower use of syngas at the Ferrera Erbognone plant, which has improved the emission index. As part of its responsible approach to biomass(9), Eni is committed to transparency and dissemination of information relating to the biomasses used and the country of origin, providing this information once a year. In 2021, Eni traced 100% of the mills and plantations from which its palm oil was sourced for the Venice and Gela biorefineries. 100% of the palm oil used is ISCC-certified. Furthermore, it should be noted that Versalis in 2021 at the Crescentino site used 109,966 tonnes of wood chips, while at the Mantua site 138 tonnes of sunflower oil were used for formulation purposes. All the biomass used by Versalis comes from Italy.

In 2021, Eni's consumption of raw materials increased in relation to higher production levels compared to 2020. The total energy consumed was 13.2 million toe of which Upstream 5.4, R&M 1.7 and Chemicals 1.6. In 2021, Eni went ahead with its investment plan both in projects aimed directly at increasing energy efficiency in assets (€10 million) and in development and revamping projects with significant gains in the energy performance of operations. The interventions carried out during the year allow an actual saving of primary energy compared to baseline consumption of 391 ktoe/year, deriving mainly from upstream projects (approximately 81%), with a benefit in terms of reducing emissions of approximately 0.9 million tonnes of CO2eq. If Scope 2 emissions, i.e. from purchased electricity and heat, are also taken into account, the CO2 savings from energy saving projects amount to almost 1 million tonnes of CO2eq. The Exploration & Production (E&P) sector made a major contribution to this result, with 70 energy efficiency initiatives implemented in 15 companies in 13 different Countries, allowing savings equal to about 318 ktoe/year of fuel. The most significant measures implemented by the sector concerned the revamping of compression units for gas for export or reinjection, adaptation of equipment to new operating conditions, thermal integration between adjacent plants and optimisation of the production network.

EMPLOYMENT AND DIVERSITY Overview. Overall employment amounts to 31,888 people, of whom 20,632 are in Italy (64.7% of Eni employees) and 11,256 are abroad (35.3% of Eni employees). In 2021, employment at a global level grew by 1,113 people compared to 2020, equal to +3.6%, with a decrease in Italy (-538 employees) and growth abroad (+1,651 employees). Employment growth is linked to Eni's development plans as part of the initiatives to support the energy transition, also through the acquisition of new companies operating in the renewable energy and circular economy sectors. Despite the discontinuity of the energy market, Eni continued to pursue its diversity objectives: in 2021, the number of female employees increased by 1.6 percent compared to 2020, with simultaneous growth for positions of responsibility (0.7 percent vs. 2020). Hires. Overall, in 2021, 1,305 people were hired, including 967 with permanent contracts. About 81%10 of new hires with permanent contracts involved employees up to the age of 40. Of the total number of hires, approximately 58% were for the Energy Evolution department (total 754, including 612 permanent and 142 with fixed-term contracts), 30% for the Natural Resources department (total 389, 233 permanent and 156 fixedterm) and the remaining 12% for the Support Function (total 162 including 122 permanent and 40 fixed-term). Terminations. 2,517 contracts were terminated (1,694 in Italy and 823 abroad), 2,275 of which were permanent contracts11, with 27.0% relating to female employees. 25%10 of employees with per- manent contracts who ended their employment were under 50 years of age. Eni's transformation process, which requires a high skills turnover, is also reflected in the trend in the turnover rate, which in 2021 was the highest for the last 3 years (2019: 9.8%, 2020: 6.1%; 2021: 10.5%). Employment in Italy. There were 596 hires in Italy, of which 460 were permanent contracts (32.4% women). The reduction in employment of -538 units (-3%), carried out through an extraordinary exit plan, together with a selective and punctual turnover plan, has allowed the population under 30 to increase by 4% in favour of a reduction in the senior age groups: the population over 50 has decreased by 1.5%. Again in Italy, in 2021, there were 1,694 terminations, 1,658 of which related to employees with permanent contracts (of which 26% were women). Overall in Italy, at the end of 2021 there was a replacement ratio between new hires and terminations of approximately 1:3.6 (1 hire vs. 3.6 terminations). Employment abroad. Average presence of local employees abroad is constant and around 86% in the last three years on average, that confirms Eni commitment to local content through the engagement of local communities in its business activities in the Countries. Use of expatriate personnel is limited to specific expertise and competences hardly available in the Country. Abroad, in 2021, there were 709 new hires, of which 507 were with permanent contracts (32.5% women); 72% were employees younger than 40. The balance between hires and terminations abroad at the end of the year was -114 (+709 hires and -823 terminations) and this trend is also attributable to contractual terminations of international resources employed in the E&P business. There were 823 terminations of which 617 were permanent contracts. Of these, 40%10 involved employees under the age of 40, and 29%10 involved women. Abroad, there was an increase of 1,651 resources compared to the previous year (+17.2%), mainly referring to +1,624 local resources (+19.5%), Italian expatriates +24 (+2.5%) while the number of international expatriates remained stable +3 (+1%). The growth in local personnel is mainly due to special M&A operations. Abroad there are a total of 1,305 expatriates (including 992 Italians and 313 international expatriates). Employment by line of business. About 35% of new hires with permanent hires were in the chemicals sector, which has strengthened both in countries with traditional activities (e.g. France, UK, Hungary) and in countries with new activities (e.g. Mexico, India, Romania, Vietnam). Growth also concerned the Retail G&P (France and Greece) and GT/R&M (UK, Germany and Ecuador) business areas, which further consolidated their skills and expertise. Terminations mainly related to the Upstream (30%), Chemicals (24%) and GT/R&M (18%) businesses. Average age. The average age of Eni people in the world is 45.1 years (46.4 in Italy and 42.8 abroad): 49.3 years (50.1 in Italy and 47.2 abroad) for senior and middle managers, 44.4 years (45.5 in Italy and 42.3 abroad) for white collar workers and 41.9 years (40.7 in Italy and 43.9 abroad) for blue-collar workers.

In 2021, the percentage of women in positions of responsibility increased to 27.3%, compared to 26.6% in 2020; in all, women accounted for 26.22% of the total workforce. The 2021 female turnover figure is 0.51 (vs. male turnover 0.39), down slightly compared to 2020, mainly due to the effect of the extraordinary operations to accelerate turnover. Career opportunities. In recent years, the company has paid particular attention to growth processes and development paths for female personnel, which has led to the average % of promotions for female personnel being higher than the % of women in the company (31% average promotions vs. 24.4% female staff). In 2020, due to a slowdown in development processes resulting from the health emergency, there was a slight drop in the trend of promotions of female personnel, which largely recovered the following year.
REMUNERATION AND WORKING CONDITIONS OF ENI EMPLOYEES. 
For more information: Eni for 2021 - A just transition - Each of us, p. 49 Eni places all its people at the heart of its business strategy in line with the United Nations objectives of wage improvement, reduction of income inequality, promotion of decent job opportunities, gender, generational, ethnic equality etc. in accordance with the “equal pay for equal work” principle. In particular, Eni applies a worldwide integrated remuneration system to all its people, also consistent with the reference markets in terms of pay progression and linked to company and individual performance, in compliance with local legislation. This system, as for the Chief Executive Officer, adopts market references made up of, for each role, the median of the sectors to which they belong, thus guaranteeing the application of fair and competitive remuneration policies with respect to the role and professional skills and always able to support a decent standard of living, higher than the mere subsistence levels and/or the legal or contractual minimums in force, as well as the minimum wages found on the local market, as highlighted by the indicators shown below.
GENDER PAY RATIO Eni monitors the gender pay gap on an annual basis and shares with the relevant functions the results of the verifications for each business line and company, in order to assess corrective actions, if necessary. Furthermore, the principle of equal pay is explicitly referred to in the remuneration policy implementation provisions sent to all Eni business lines. The table shows the gender pay ratio data for fixed and total remuneration, which generally show a substantial alignment between the remuneration of women and men, both for Italy and globally, with deviations mainly due to the level of female presence in some occupational categories.

In calculating the pay ratio, Eni uses a method that neutralises the effects deriving from differences in the level of role and seniority according to the United Nations principle of “equal pay for equal work” and which shows for the population Italy and the global population a substantial alignment between the salaries of the female population and the male population. This alignment is confirmed in overall terms, even when determining the pay ratio not at the same level of role and seniority ("raw pay ratio").
The following graphs show the global presence of women in the pay quartiles and in the ninth decile12, highlighting, in relative terms, a reduced presence of women in the lowest pay quartile (19%) and in the ninth decile (18%).

WELFARE 2021 was a year marked by the continuation of the state of health emergency that began in 2020. Despite the difficult context, continuity of services to people was guaranteed, ensuring high quality standards and maximum protection for participants, their families and personnel involved. Organisational and operational services models have been designed based on the application of and compliance with anti-contamination regulations and health and safety protocols issued by the company and the authorities. Family and work-life balance. With the aim of supporting families in achieving a work-life balance, Eni offers employees various services. The Nidoscuola childcare facilities present in the Rome and San Donato Milanese offices welcome employees' children from 6 months to 6 years of age. The service is based on a high quality pedagogical approach and is designed to offer maximum service flexibility, centred on the well-being of the child. The two facilities can accommodate around 300 children in total. Summer camps are aimed at children of employees aged between 6 and 16, with a range of different activities based on age and destination. Families can choose between a stay by the sea at the Cesenatico facility or in the mountains at the Bardonecchia facility. In 2021, the service hosted around 950 participants. In 2021, childcare services and summer camps were operated, with all actions taken to mitigate the risk of infection and to protect the safety of children, families and personnel. Safety protocols were redefined, not only incorporating the regulatory updates issued but also enhancing and constantly monitoring the application of all protective measures. In the field of family assistance, Eni offers the Fragibilità service, a contact centre for all issues related to care giving. The initiative, through a web platform and a telephone number managed by a social worker, provides guidance and personalised advice for problems related to the management of elderly or non-autonomous family members and for the care of children and young people with specific learning disorders. Vocational school guidance for employees' children and information programmes to support parents in dealing with problems in this area have also been confirmed. More than 3,200 people have signed up for the proposed initiatives. The need to preserve health during the pandemic period saw the generalised extension of Smart Working.

For more information: Eni for 2021 - A just transition - Each of us, p. 51 to around 90% of office staff and to all workers in health fragility conditions assessed by the competent doctor, regardless of their job description. In 2021, the new “Smart Working” agreement for remote working in Italy was signed. With this agreement, the organisation of remote working has improved, including through specific company welfare measures (e.g. support for parents, disabilities and, in general, greater attention to the needs of employees at different stages of their lives). This agreement also ensured the right to disconnect and strengthened measures to protect the security of individuals. Guidance has also been provided on the conduct to be adopted by companies operating abroad following an in-depth analysis of the regulatory framework in certain countries of interest to Eni. In its offices Eni offers flexibility working on a daily and multi-period basis as well as paid leave for special personal events (e.g. bereavement, serious family illness, marriages and civil unions, study leave and professional training courses).
Parenting. In all Countries where Eni is present, it grants 10 working days fully paid paternity leave to workers who are fathers, as well as a minimum maternity leave of 14 weeks with payment of at least 2/3 of the salary received in the previous period, in accordance with the standards provided for by the ILO convention. The right of access to Smart Working for the first three years of a child’s life has been established for parents working in the main offices. Health prevention campaigns and well-being. In response to an increased awareness of health issues and greater investment in the pursuit of mental and physical well-being, increasing attention has been paid to catering, health and wellness issues. The Previeni medical protocol with Eni has been strengthened and a new initiative launched to promote sports activities for all Eni employees and their families. During 2021, the “Previeni con Eni” (Prevent with Eni) medical protocol, which began as a check-up for cancer prevention, was supplemented with examinations and check-ups for cardiovascular prevention. More than 3,000 people signed up for check-up programmes and targeted specialist visits. In response to an increased need for physical and mental well-being, a new initiative to promote physical activity was launched in September. It offers all Eni employees and their families access to the Fitprime platform, which allows them to take out discounted subscriptions at a network of around 2,000 sports centres throughout Italy and to access free live streaming lessons and on demand training sessions. Since its launch, the initiative has been a huge success with over 3,000 registrations to the platform and over 200 subscriptions.

The year 2021, in continuity with 2020, still saw a strong predominance of remote learning (67%) over classroom training, given the continuing constraints imposed by the pandemic emergency. Total training hours remained at the same level as in 2020 (-0.3%), but with a different composition by type, with a significant recovery in the HSEQ area, including operational training, and in the behavioural area, thanks also to the Lead the Change course, aimed at managers and team leaders. Total expenditure also increased as a result of the increase in the number of training courses required and designed for the businesses, also in the context of the Expansion Contract.

The year 2021 was characterised by the continuation of the COVID-19 emergency and the use of KM systems, which operate remotely by their very nature. This contributed to the maintenance of levels of exchange and dissemination of knowledge without being affected by the situation. On the contrary, it strengthened the sense of belonging and participation of people in normal company activities. The overall strategy remains therefore to support, through KM activities, the development of Eni's business, the skills required, operational problem solving and innovation processes.
At the macro level, following the discontinuation of obsolete tools and the definitive transition of some communities to e-KMS, the dominance of the latter is confirmed. It is now used in almost all KM initiatives, benefiting from greater cross-functionality and participation in a knowledge-sharing environment and optimising overall costs. Furthermore, the consolidation of some Communities continued, with the overall number decreasing from 58 to 55, but with an increase in participants from 32,266 to 35,510 members (+3,244, +10.1%), an indicator of further engagement of people.
After a pilot phase, the spread of Private Networks, private practice communities with access limited to specifically authorised users, has been consolidated in e-KMS. At the end of 2021, there were 27 Private Networks with 2,058 participants. The dissemination of a culture increasingly oriented towards the sharing of knowledge, making the most of experience and cooperation was also supported by the creation of another training brief "How knowledge management can boost transformation" made available as an "open" course in Enicampus for all Eni personnel.
FURTHER INFORMATION ON e-KMS For Eni, people and their skills are the key aspect that characterises the company’s technical expertise. Knowledge Management System activities provide continuous and cross-cutting support to General Directions, the TECH Department and Support Functions in man- aging the entire flow of technical knowledge, offering technological tools, strategies and specialist models. The aim is to stimulate new ideas and innovation, to map skills and knowledge so that they can be found and activated when necessary, and to ensure that experiences and lessons learned are readily shared and disseminated throughout the Eni world and adequately capitalised for future applications. In 2021, the strategy and activities of the team managing the Company Knowledge Management System (e-KMS) focused on three main fronts: • for the professional areas that are more mature in terms of.

Within the company intranet, MyEni, the space dedicated to COVID-19 communications, the section called “Informed. Aware. Safe” is regularly updated. Eni has set up an efficient model of internal information and communication, in order to remain close to its people at all times through widespread, global and timely actions. Colleagues were guided through an awareness-raising process on how to respect the rules and standards of behaviour to be adopted in the workplace to protect their own health, that of their colleagues and their family and friends. For Eni, it is essential to make sure that all its personnel understand the decarbonisation strategy to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. The CEO supported his employees with regular meetings in 2021 through his Blog and using live streaming to maintain a strong sense of community and help staff with cultural and strategic changes. Internal communication is a lever that supports the company and its people at this moment of business and cultural transformation. The internal communication programme "Our Eni. Fit for purpose", launched in 2020, supported all Eni personnel in 2021 in the company's evolution towards the decarbonisation of processes and products. The programme featured the CEO and the Chairperson in a live-streamed presentation to illustrate the strategy and raise awareness among all colleagues. This was followed by interviews with managers working on the most strategic projects, periodic surveys and the Q&A Live Week, a week of live events in which Eni personnel spoke directly with top management about strategy and the future. The whole programme was enriched by global gaming, a virtual competition to test knowledge of the great challenges ahead.
To support the cultural change and the new way of working, the company has adopted a number of important innovations that have a positive effect on people and their behaviour. Human Focus, Eni's new repertoire of skills and behaviours, was presented to all personnel with a joint campaign created with the Head of Human Resources and other endorsers. The New Smart Working concept, which provides for major improvements in the work-life balance, was the subject of a lengthy campaign, including the recruitment of internal staff to provide testimonials. MyChange, a new digital training environment, allows everyone, through an interactive and dynamic path of knowledge and learning, to actively participate in the cultural change that our company is experiencing and has been supported by targeted communication actions. On the theme of inclusion, the.

This focus on quality has inevitably led to a contraction of shared contributions; • for professional areas that are less mature in terms of Knowledge Management, a number of communication and engagement initiatives were organised with the aim of increasing participation and the number of contributions shared through the e-KMS platform; • planning has also started for the integration of the e-KMS platform with the company tool dedicated to the collection, validation, capitalisation and dissemination of Lessons Learnt, in order to increase the synergy between the two platforms and improve the usability of the content for the users.

Eni for Inclusion programme was launched. It is a month dedicated to valuing the uniqueness of each of us, at a time when very valuable international days focusing on specific D&I targets with a aim of raising awareness are taking place, such as the International Day against Violence against Women, the International Day of Disability, and the International Day of Human Rights. A communication and engagement programme and many initiatives aimed at respect and inclusion provided an important opportunity for reflection throughout the company. We were all involved, from top management to our people and their families, in a major collective awareness campaign called #IoConLei (#ImWithHer) against violence against women in line with Orange The World promoted by the United Nations. A video interview with colleagues with disabilities marked International Disability Day and an internal event on sexual orientation was the first step on a path to inclusion that will see many more initiatives in the future.
Performance assessment process14. Compared to 2020, full coverage of senior managers was confirmed and coverage of middle managers declined slightly but remained at high levels (96%), while there was a more pronounced decline in the coverage of the process for the population of Young Graduates (0-7 years seniority). This decline can be mainly attributed to the recruitment boom in recent years (particularly in 2019-2021) as well as to M&A processes. The five-year view, however, returns an improving coverage trend especially for the populations of Middle Managers and Other White Collar workers. Annual review process15. The analysis of the coverage of the segmentation and management review process confirms complete mapping for senior management and a high level for the remaining populations. The slight decrease, especially in middle management and white collar workers, is mainly attributable to extraordinary M&A translated into recruitment and acquisition of resources during the year (to which the Annual Review process was not applied). Potential assessment process16. In 2021, 100% of Potential Assessments were carried out (through the Development Centre methodology, Online Assessment and Individual Assessment) compared to the total planned and with an overall improvement trend (+5 % points compared to 2020), thanks to precise planning of the activities by the Businesses. The percentage increase compared to 2020 was observed in the foreign activities and was favoured by the conduct of the assessment sessions carried out remotely, which allowed more flexibility and "inclusiveness". Furthermore, 110 senior and middle managers were assessed using the Management Appraisal methodology in 2021.
14) Performance appraisal: this is the main tool for communicating company priorities and objectives, guiding the orientation of activities and for the continuous improvement of results and managerial and professional skills. Its purpose is to appraise the contribution provided and the results achieved during the year by the people and is one of the reference elements for the rewarding system. 15) Annual Review: Annual process aimed at expressing a synthetic resources evaluation that takes into account, in a coherent way, all the instruments/moments of observation/assessment of the year, identifying the population groups for the definition of targeted development actions. 16) Potential assessment: measurement of potential allows the collection of information related to personal skills and behaviours expressed at work also for the purpose of the timely identification of resources with high growth potential. Measuring potential, in particular in the first period of working life, provides fundamental support for the development of personal and professional skills and for orientation towards growth paths with prevalent managerial or technical-professional content, coherent with the business needs.

In December 2020, the INSIEME protocol, a model of industrial relations to support the energy transition path was signed with the national trade unions. With this protocol, Eni and the trade unions considered it increasingly important to accelerate the energy transition process and shared that this process will require transparent sharing of information, goals and initiatives. For this reason they considered that an even more effective and participatory system of industrial relations is necessary to accompany the transformation processes, which combine economic sustainability with the principles of environmental and social sustainability. In April 2021, the expansion contract was signed with the trade unions at the Ministry of Labour and Social Policies, making it possible to promote generational change, with the introduction of new skills and new trades and significant investment for the training and retraining of Eni peo- ple, confirming the great strategic importance that the company attributes to skills. In October 2021, the new agreement for remote working (Smart Working) in Italy was signed. With this agreement, the organisation of remote working was improved (providing for 8 days/month for offices and 4 days/ month for operational sites) with the addition of new types of remote working to support company welfare (described in the following paragraph). In the agreement, the workers’ fundamental right to disconnect is ensured, introducing precise standards and basic measures to be respected for remote working in order to support the correct balance between working life and private life and avoid negative effects that the prolonged use of digital tools can determine on health and well-being. Trade union rights have also been guaranteed when operating remotely, also strengthening the measures to protect the safety of people.
In December 2021, international industrial relations meetings were held as well as the 24th meeting of the EWC of Eni employees, the European Observatory for Health, Safety and the Environment and the annual meeting provided for by the Global Framework Agreement on International Industrial Relations and Social Responsibility of the Company on the issues of sustainability, decarbonisation, health and safety of workers and with a focus on the theme of Diversity & Inclusion, for the enhancement of diversity, as an element of enrichment of experiences in the social and work context. During the meeting, the Agreement for integration into the GFA – Global Framework Agreement on International Industrial Relations and Corporate Social Responsibility – of ILO Convention No. 190 and ILO Recommendation No. 206 on eliminating violence and harassment in the world of work was also signed.

The number of disputes pending at the end of the year in 2021 was also affected by the slowdown in court times due to the COVID-19 emergency, which delayed the conclusion of many judgments and changed the normal turnover between new disputes and completed proceedings. As regards Italy, more than half of the 1,052 ongoing disputes still concern claims for damages by former employees, or their heirs, for alleged occupational diseases. These alleged diseases are related to exposure to potentially harmful agents occurring in the past, often prior to the 1990s, at industrial sites that were not managed by Eni but acquired later as a result of corporate transactions.

In 2021, all the companies continued to implement health management systems with the objective of promoting and maintaining the health and well-being of Eni people and ensuring adequate risk management in the workplace. As confirmation of this, the business areas completed the planned health monitoring programmes. In 2021, in order to assess the potential impact of projects on the health of the communities involved, Eni completed 10 HIAs (Health Impact Assessments), of which 3 were integrated ESHIA studies (Environmental and Social Health Impact Assessment): 7 pre-ESHIAs, including 2 in Indonesia, 1 in Angola, 1 in Congo, 1 in Egypt, 1 in Italy and 1 in the UK; 3 ESHIA including 2 in Vietnam and 1 in Oman. In 2021, the number of health services supported by Eni was 379,481, of which 261,618 were for employees, 43,835 for family members, 70,970 for contractors and 3,058 for others (e.g.
visitors and external patients). The number of participants in health promotion initiatives in 2021 was 158,784, of whom 85,776 were employees, 58,031 contractors and 14,977 family members. As concerns occupational illnesses, in 2021 there were 30 notifications, of which 7 related to employees and 23 related to former employees. Of the 30 occupational disease notifications submitted in 2021, 4 were submitted by heirs (all relating to former employees).

In 2021, the total recordable injury frequency ratio (TRIR) of the workforce improved compared to 2020 (-4%), thanks to the performance recorded by contractors (-10%), while the employee ratio deteriorated due to the increase in the number of accidents (33 compared to 30 in 2020). The ratio for injuries at work with serious consequences is null, since there were no events falling into this category (i.e. no injuries with more than 180 days of absence or with consequences such as total or partial permanent disability). In addition, no fatal accidents were recorded. In Italy, the number of injuries increased (35 events compared to 27 in 2020, including 21 employees and 14 contractors) and the total recordable injury frequency ratio (TRIR) worsened (+26%); abroad the number of injuries decreased (53 events compared to 64 in 2020, including 12 employees and 41 contractors), and the total recordable injury frequency ratio improved by 17%.
The number of certifications and the percentage of coverage according to a given standard are influenced by changes in the consolidation domain and by possible mergers of several operations under one certificate. In 2021, Eni continued its activities aimed at certifying all its companies with significant HSE risks according to the ISO 45001 (management systems for health and safety at work) and ISO 14001 (environmental management systems) standards, maintaining the percentage of coverage at around 90%, with the expectation of achieving total coverage, even for recently acquired companies, by 2023 for both standards. The ISO 9001 certifications referring to companies at significant HSE risk have a coverage percentage of 43%. The main production units in the Refining & Marketing and Chemicals (R&MeC) and Plenitude & Power sectors have maintained EMAS17 registration and certification of their energy management systems according to the ISO 50001 standard, with the addition, in 2021, of EMAS registration of the Gela Refinery and ISO 50001 certification of the San Donato Milanese Re- search Centre. Total HSE expenses in 2021 amounted to approximately €1,443 million. Safety expenses of more than €331 million mainly related to work on plant, equipment and firefighting management (more than €85 million), maintenance of plant and equipment (about €84 million), and safety of plants, buildings and vehicles (more than €77 million). Environmental expenditure, amounting to approximately €1,030 million is mainly due to remediation of land and groundwater (totalling about €452 million) and waste management (over €258 million).
17) EMAS Registration (acronym for Eco-Management and Audit Scheme) is a voluntary tool aimed at promoting rational management of environmental performance in line with the provisions of European Regulation 1221/2009.

In 2021, seawater withdrawals were down 4% overall, due to the significant decrease recorded in the R&MeC sector (-188 Mm3) due to the maintenance shutdown at the Brindisi petrochemical plant and the end of the functionality tests on the seawater network that in 2020 had led to an increase in the related withdrawals. Freshwater withdrawals, accounting for about 7% of total water withdrawals and over 73% attributable to the R&MeC sector, increased by 10%. The trend is mainly attributable to the petrochemical plant in Mantua (+7 Mm3) where withdrawals returned to normal after the minimum of 2020 linked to the stress tests carried out on-site to check what the minimum consumption of the plant could be in favourable conditions. Eni's freshwater reuse rate in 2021 remained stable at 91%. The E&P sector’s produced water re-injection rate increased to 58% (53% in 2020), thanks to the complete resumption of re-injection activities in Congo (Loango and Zatchi) and Libya (Abu-Attifel and El Feel). In 2021, the content of total hydrocarbons in discharged water was 127.8 tonnes. The most significant contribution is due to the activities of E&P in Congo. Analysis of the stress level of hydrographic basins and further studies carried out locally shows that fresh- water withdrawals from areas under stress account for 1.5% of Eni total water withdrawals in 2021 (data unchanged compared to 2020). In 2021, in particular, Eni withdrew 125 Mm3 of freshwater, of which 25.9 Mm3 was from water-stressed areas (11.9 Mm3 from superficial water bodies, 6.1 Mm3 from groundwater, 2.6 Mm3 from third parties, 3.5 Mm3 from urban net and 1.8 Mm3 from TAF). Onshore produced water in water-stressed areas was 22.7 Mm3. In 2021, Eni discharged 94 Mm3 of freshwater, of which 19 Mm3 in water-stressed areas, equal to 20% as in 2020. In 2021 Eni's freshwater consumption was 40 Mm3 (of which 12 Mm3 in water-stressed areas).

In 2021, Eni updated its assessment of the exposure to biodiversity risk of concessions under development or exploitation in the upstream sector and the operational sites of the other business lines in order to identify where Eni activities fall, even only partially, within protected areas18 or Key Bio- diversity Areas (KBA19). Compared to last year, the analysis was also extended to wind and solar plants in Italy and abroad, and to the recent acquisitions of biomethane production plants in Italy. The analysis of the mapping of operational sites showed that there is overlap, even partial, with protected areas or KBAs at 22 sites, all located in Italy with the exception of two sites in Spain and one in France; another 45 sites in 10 countries (Italy, Australia, Austria, France, Germany, United Kingdom, Spain, Switzerland, Tunisia, Hungary) border with protected areas or KBAs, i.e. located at a distance of less than.

As regards the upstream sector, 73 concessions partially overlap with protected areas or KBAs, of which 30, located in 6 Countries (Italy, Nigeria, Pakistan, United States/Alaska, Egypt and the United Kingdom) have operations in the overlapping area. In general, for all the Business Lines, the greatest exposure in Italy and Europe is to the protected areas of the Natura 2000 Network20, which is spread across Europe; this exposure is more accentuated than last year as a result of the new acquisitions of the Eni New Energy company in the renewables and biomethane production plants sector. On the other hand, in the upstream sector there was a decrease in exposure to protected areas and KBAs mainly due to modifications (reduction in boundaries) of the concessions in Italy. In no case, in Italy or abroad, is there any overlap of operational activity with UNESCO World Heritage Sites (WHS21); only one upstream22 site is located in the vicinity of a WHS natural site (Mount Etna) but there are no operational activities within the protected area.

Spilled barrels following operational oil spills increased by 41% compared to 2020 due to a spill of almost 900 barrels at the Gela Refinery, due to an error during oil transfer operations from tanks to ships (more than half of the barrels have already been recovered). 73% of the barrels spilled are attributable to activities in Italy, 15% to Nigeria. Overall, 51% of the operational oil spill volumes were recovered. With regard to oil spills due to sabotage events, 2021 saw an increase in the number of events (+13% compared to 2020), but a reduction of almost half in the barrels spilled (-48% compared to the previous year). All the sabotage events took place in Nigeria, where the quantities spilled decreased by 31% compared to the previous year and 83% of the volumes were recovered. Volumes spilled as a result of chemical spills (68 total barrels) are mainly attributable to Versalis' activities, in particular for an event that occurred at the Grangemouth plant with a loss of 55 barrels. In 2021, volumes spilled from operating spills impacted 97% soil and 3% water bodies, while those from sabotage impacted 99.8% soil and 0.2% water bodies. No oil spills occurred in the Arctic in 2021. Moreover, regarding spills impacting shorelines with ESI rankings 8-10, consistent to classification of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the volume is 0.

In 2021, the emissions of pollutants into the atmosphere increased, with the exception of emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx), which decreased by 6% compared to the previous year, thanks to the decrease in consumption of internal combustion engines recorded in some operating entities of the E&P sector. The increase in emissions of sulphur ox- ides (SOx) and volatile organic compounds (NMVOC) are also mainly attributable to the E&P sector: in particular, the increase in SOx is due to the increase in the H2S content in the gas sent for flaring in KPO, while the increase in NMVOC is linked to the increase in non-routine flaring recorded in NAOC due to problems with the compressors.

Waste generated by Eni from production activities in 2021 increased by 19% compared to 2020, due to the growing contribution of both non-hazardous waste (equal to 78% of the total) and hazardous waste. The increase is mainly linked to the E&P sector (which accounts for over 88% of Eni waste), where a total of more than 334,000 tonnes were generated compared to 2020, in line with the progressive resumption of activities after the COVID-19 emergency. In the E&P sector, drilling activities in Egypt, the USA, Vietnam, Mexico and Norway also had an impact. Plenitude & Power and R&MeC also contributed to the growing trend of non-hazardous waste, in particular the EniPower plant in Ravenna (construction of new temporary waste storage and start of piling and foundations for the new boil- er) and the Taranto refinery (progress of the Tempa Rossa project). In 2021, recovered and recycled waste increased by 15% compared to 2020, representing 11% of total waste disposed23 for the growing contributions of both hazardous and non-hazardous waste in the E&P and R&MeC sectors. Regarding waste management, Eni pays particular attention to the traceability of the entire process and to the verification of the parties involved in the disposal/ recovery chain, in order to ensure compliance with regulations and the environment. Eni also envisages that all feasible solutions aimed at waste prevention should be sought. Almost all Eni waste in Italy is managed by Eni Rewind24 which in 2021 continued the digitalisation project launched in 2020 to improve the efficiency and monitoring of its waste management process. In order to limit the negative impacts related to waste (e.g. loss of resources, possible contamination of environmental matrices due to inappropriate management, impacts related to transport and treatment at destination plants), in line with the priority criteria indicated by EU and national regulations, Eni Rewind, on the basis of the characteristics of the individual waste, selects technically viable recovery/ disposal solutions, prioritising recovery and treatment operations that reduce the quantities to be sent for final disposal and suitable plants at a shorter distance from the waste production site; furthermore, audits are carried out on environmental suppliers, to assess their operational waste management.
23) Specifically, in 2021, 9% of the hazardous waste resulting from production activities disposed of by Eni was recovered/recycled, 2% was subjected to chemical/physical/biological treatment, 38% was incinerated, 1% was disposed of in landfill, while the remaining 50% was sent to other types of disposal (including transfer to temporary storage plants prior to final disposal). With regard to non-hazardous waste resulting from production activities, 12% was recovered/recycled, 4% was disposed of in landfill, while the remaining 84% was sent to other types of disposal (including transfer to temporary storage plants prior to final disposal and incineration of small quantity). 24) Eni Rewind is Eni’s environmental company that operates in line with the principles of the circular economy to enhance industrial land, water and waste, or waste derived from remediation activities, through sustainable remediation and recovery projects, both in Italy and abroad.
In 2021, a total of 4.2 million tons of waste were generated by remediation activities (of which 3.9 million from Eni Rewind), consisting of over 89% of groundwater treated by TAF plants, partly reused and partly returned to the environment; the remaining volumes are handled and transferred to third-party plants. The total expenditure on remediation in 2021 amounts to more than €452 million, with an increase compared to previous periods. More than 55% of reme- diation costs are borne by Eni Rewind (more than €250 million in 2021 and more than €208 million in 2020), which is engaged in soil and groundwater remediation at contaminated sites, both disused and operational.

Mandatory training for senior managers and middle managers (Italy and abroad) of the 4 specific modules continued in 2021: "Security and Human Rights", "Human Rights and relations with Communities", "Human Rights in the Workplace" and "Human rights in the Supply Chain". In addition, the provision of sustainability and human rights courses to the entire Eni population continued: the reduction in hours of training on human rights is linked to the scheduling of training activities over several years. However, the overall course utilisation rate increased to 94.2% of those enrolled. As regards the Security professional area, in 2021 the percentage of personnel trained in human rights stood at 90%. The percentage of Security Personnel who have received training on human rights reflects the qualitative/ quantitative turnover of incoming and outgoing resources from the Professional Area year on year. In addition, since 2009 Eni has been conducting a training programme for public and private security forces at its subsidiaries, which was recognized as a best practice in the 2013 joint publication by the Global Compact and the. 
Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) of the United Nations. In 2021, the training session was carried out in Mexico and was attended by 88 representatives from the security forces. The event was attended, in class or remotely, by 116 other people, including Eni's management and employees, belonging to other oil companies and NGOs. In 2021, two "Human Rights Impact Assessment" (HRIAs) were conducted in Angola and Albania and two "Human Rights Risk Analyses" (HRRAs) in Oman and the Emirate of Sharjah (UAE). Furthermore, implementation continued of actions under the Action Plans related to Human Rights Impact Analyses, carried out during 2019 and 2018 on Area 1 development in Mexico and Area 4 development in Mozambique. All HRIA reports conducted up to 2020 and the related Action Plans adopted, including the periodic reports on the progress of the Plans, are publicly available on the Eni website. It should be noted that, in order to prepare an effective response to the provisions of Convention no. 190 of the International Labour Organization on the elimination of violence and harassment in the workplace (ratified by Italy on January 4, 2021), in April 2021 a multidisciplinary Working Group was set up at Eni, coordinated by the Integrated Compliance Function and involving various Eni departments, including Sustainability. Eni wanted to move forward on an issue of central importance, using Convention no. 190 as a starting point, which provides for a series of obligations for companies to prevent violence and harassment at work. To this end, on December 21, 2021, Annex E "Eni against violence and harassment at work" was issued to the "Internal Control and Risk Management System" MSG. Furthermore, in line with the principles of "responsible contracting" suggested by international best practices and guidelines on Business & Human Rights, the Integrated Compliance Function in coordination with the Sustainability Function has prepared a series of standard clauses on human rights compliance to be included on the basis of a risk-based approach in the main Eni contractual cases, and provides support to the business for defining and negotiating them.

27) Past convictions relating to criminal proceedings for domestic and/or international corruption.
In 2021 the anti-corruption checks, based on the Anti-Corruption Compliance Program's provisions, have been performed in 20 audits, carried out in 9 countries, moreover 22 supervisory activities were carried out on the 231/ Compliance Models of the Italian/foreign subsidiaries. Furthermore, in continuity with 2020, specific training initiatives were carried out on the topic of Whistleblowing (2 workshops in Italy). As in 2020, the number of ascertained cases of corruption27 relating to Eni Spa amounted to 0; for ongoing proceedings, see the section “Disputes” in the Annual Report see p. 288 onwards Eni implements an anti-corruption training program for its employees, both through e-learning and with classroom events, as general workshops and with job-specific training. The workshops offer an overview of the anti-corruption laws applicable to Eni, the risks that could result from their infringement for natural and legal persons and the Anti-Corruption Compliance Program adopted to address these risks. Generally, the workshops are accompanied by job specific training, or training for professional areas particularly at risk in terms of corruption. In order to optimise the identification of the recipients of the various training initiatives, a methodology has been defined for the systematic segmentation of Eni people based on specific risk drivers such as Country, qualification and professional area. In addition, periodic information and updating activities continued through the preparation of short information briefs on compliance, including any anti-corruption issues. In 2021, the e-learning training continued on anti-corruption issues according to the risk-based methodology started in 2019, aimed at the entire company population. In addition, it should be noted that in 2020, on the occasion of their appointment, the members of the Board of Directors of Eni SpA were shown the key elements of the Anti-Corruption Compliance Program for training purposes, also in terms of its consistency with international best practices. As part of the anti-corruption training event for third parties, Eni has launched an online training programme for employees of GreenStream BV (a company 50% owned by Eni North Africa BV and 50% by the Libyan National Oil Corporation) and for the associated businesses of Eni G&P France SA. Eni’s Anti-Corruption Compliance Program has evolved over the years with the aim of continuous improvement; in January 2017, Eni SpA was the first Italian company to achieve the ISO37001:2016 “Antibribery Management Systems” certification. In order to maintain this certification,

(b) Investigations conducted have revealed evidence that one or more of the assertions in the report are reasonably believed to be true (classification introduced on October 1st, 2021). (c) Whistleblowing reports that do not contain elements that are circumstantial, precise and/or sufficiently detailed and/or, for which on the basis of the available investigative tools, it is not possible to confirm or exclude the validity of the assertions contained in the report.
In 2021, 94 whistleblowing reports28 were received on the "Internal Control and Risk Management System", and 73 files were opened. During the same period, a total of 74 files were closed, resulting in the following outcomes: (i) for 51 files the checks did not find any evidence to confirm the facts reported, however, for 21 files improvement actions were taken in any case; (ii) for 23 files the checks confirmed, at least in part, the contents of the reports and the appropriate corrective actions were taken. These 23 files mainly relate to: employees behaviour not compliant with internal rules and anomalies in the award and management of contracts and anomalies in the management of HSE risks. The corrective actions taken as a result of these files mainly consisted of (i) actions on the Internal Control and Risk Management System, relating to the implementation and strengthening of the existing controls; (ii) actions against suppliers and (iii) actions against employees, including disciplinary measures, in accordance with the collective labour agreement and other applicable national laws. As of December 31, 2021, 15 files are still open.
TAX STRATEGY Regarding the Tax Strategy29, Eni has designed and implemented a Tax Control Framework for which the Eni CFO is responsible, structured in a three-step business process: (i) assessment of tax risk (Risk Assessment); (ii) identification and establishment of controls to monitor risks; (iii) verification of the effectiveness of controls and related information flows (Reporting). As part of its tax risk management and litigation activities, Eni adopts prior communication with the tax authorities and maintains relations based on transparency, dialogue and cooperation, participating, where appropriate, in enhanced cooperation projects (Co-operative Compliance). For more information: Eni for 2021 - A just transition, p. 75 28) The term “report" means any communication received by Eni concerning the Internal Control and Risk Management System and concerning behaviours referable to Eni's People carried out in violation of the Code of Ethics, any laws, regulations, provisions of authorities, internal regulations, Model 231 or Compliance Models for foreign subsidiaries, that may cause damage or prejudice to Eni, even if only to its public image. In particular, communications relating to failure to comply with external laws and regulations, the principles contained in the Code of Ethics and the rules laid down in Eni's internal regulatory system, including those concerning (i) cases of fraud against company assets and/or financial reporting, (ii) unlawful conduct pursuant to Legislative Decree 231 of 2001 and/or wilful or fraudulent violations of the 231 Model or the Compliance Models for foreign subsidiaries, (iii) possible acts of corruption (active or passive) or the violation of anti-corruption regulatory instruments. 29) See: https://www.eni.com/assets/documents/Tax-strategy_ENG.pdf.
Eni cyclically undergoes surveillance and recertification audits, which have always had a positive outcome. Regarding the commitment with EITI, Eni follows the activities conducted at international level and contributes annually to preparation of the Reports in member Countries; additionally, as a member, Eni takes part in the activities of the Multi Stakeholder Groups in Congo, Ghana, Timor Est, and the United. 
Kingdom. In Kazakhstan, Indonesia, Mozambique, Nigeria and Mexico, Eni’s subsidiaries interface with the local EITI Multi Stakeholder Groups through the industry associations present in the countries.

Other 15 8 17 (a) The grievances received by Eni's subsidiaries are classified into over 200 sustainability themes, within the corporate management system (SMS - Stakeholder Management System). The consistency of the various grievance themes may vary from one year to the next, both in terms of type and number, especially for particular years such as 2020 and 2021 characterized by the pandemic, also involving high percentage variations for some categories. In particular, the category "Community management" presents the most significant value in 2021.
An operational-level Grievance Mechanism enables any grievances31 raised by communities to be received, investigated, responded to and closed in a timely, fair and consistent manner; this process allows for action to be taken on possible critical situations, preventing them from worsening and reducing the risk of litigation. Grievances are managed and monitored with the support of the company's “Stakeholder Management System” (SMS)32 application. In 2021, Eni received 245 grievances (107 in 2021) from 7 subsidiaries/districts/plants, of which 53%, i.e. 129 cases, were resolved and closed. Most of the grievances came from Nigeria (NAOC 89%), followed by Italy, Angola, Congo, Ghana and mainly concerned: relationship management and community aspects, environmental aspects, land management, employment.
31) Claims or complaints made by an individual or a group of individuals relating to actual or perceived accidents or damage or other environmental or social impacts, whether occurring, ongoing or potential, and determined by the activities of the company or by a contractor or supplier. A grievance is defined as “resolved” when the parties have agreed on a proposed resolution. 32) For more information, see Eni for – A just transition pp. 28-29.

Other indicators. 
During 2021, 6,318 suppliers were subject to checks and assessments with reference to environmental and social sustainability aspects (including health, safety, environment, human rights, anti-corruption and compliance). Potential critical issues and/or areas for improvement were identified for 8% (487) of the suppliers audited. The critical issues mainly refer to shortcomings in compliance with health and safety regulations and the principles established by the Code of Conduct and the Code of Ethics. The total number of suppliers involved decreased compared to 2020, the year in which the critical issues recorded concerned the numerous foreign branches of international suppliers. For the same reason, there was a reduction in the number of suppliers with whom relations were interrupted (34), due to a negative evaluation during the qualification phase or due to suspension or revocation of the qualification. In 2021 the percentage of expenditure on local at some relevant foreign upstream subsidiaries was around 35% of total expenditure.
PLENITUDE CUSTOMERS On July 1st, 2021, Plenitude upgraded its company By-Laws to Benefit Company status, becoming the first major company in the energy sector to do so. Benefit Companies represent an evolution of the concept of a company, integrating in its corporate purpose, alongside the objective of profit, the aim of having a positive impact on society, communities and people, and in particular on the environment. By becoming a Benefit Company, Plenitude makes a statutory commitment to its shareholders to balance the interests of the latter, the public and all stakeholders. The Benefit Company objectives will also be supported by the integration of Eni's renewable energy activities into Plenitude. By adopting the label of a Benefit Company, it is committed to further pursuing the following specific aims of common interest in a responsible, sustainable and transparent manner with the aim of balancing the interests of its shareholders and those of the community: • to contribute to creating and disseminating a culture of sustainable energy use, enhancing the use of renewable energy sources and educating people on conscientious and efficient energy consumption, in order to actively contribute to the ongoing energy transition; • to promote, also in cooperation with other entities, the develop- ment and marketing of products, services and technologies capable of ensuring a responsible use of energy, improving the quality of life; • to safeguard diversity and integration as valuable resources in relations with its employees and collaborators, and to create favourable conditions for induction and flexible work, supporting a better work-life balance; • helping customers to make better use of energy and putting them at the centre of its activities, dealing with them fairly and transparently, offering quality products and services in line with their needs, in order to make the lifestyle and habits of the entire community more sustainable.

For the year 2021, in fact, despite the general situation still characterised by the pandemic, there has been a very good level of service. The percentage of customers who spoke to an operator was 96.8%, a better result than in previous years and well above the minimum objective set by the Regulatory Authority for Energy, Networks and the Environment (ARERA) of 85%. The average waiting time in 2021 also improved significantly compared to the previous year, standing at 166 seconds compared to 228 seconds in 2020, a year that nevertheless had to cope with the lockdown period and the consequent reorganisation of activity due to the different distribution of calls throughout the day. As regards the first call resolution rate (FCR), this remained substantially unchanged at 92% compared to 93% in the previous year. Regarding operations carried out autonomously (Self Care - channels including: Web/App/IVR-Virtual Assistant/Smart speaker-Alexa/ Chatbot) by Plenitude customers, from January 2022 the calculation of the percentage was modified, considering only the transactions (excluding self-readings) carried out independently (Self Care) out of the total transactions (transactions in Self Care + transactions by contact operator). The table shows data from 2020 onwards are calculated on the new basis. 2020 was a record year for the % of Self Care operations due to the lockdown that prevented the use of physical channels. In 2021 we maintained our digital customer base and the number of digital transactions in absolute value is higher than in 2020.

With the health emergency caused by COVID-19 radically changing customers' habits and, consequently, the way they interface with the Company, Plenitude has undertak- en all the necessary strategies to maintain adequate quality levels. In particular, it has developed and implemented a new innovative service model ("We Care") aimed at maximising the creation of value and improving the Customer Experience in a win-win logic of sharing benefits and risks with its Customer Care service partners.
Thanks to the commitment and determination of its resources and the reorganisation of the service model, not only has the continuity of activities been guaranteed, but their quality has also improved. The recognition of customers, found through the results that emerged, confirms the goodness of the actions implemented.

(b) Since May 2018, the telephone survey has been modified and a new indicator the CES (Customer Effort Score) has been introduced, which evaluates how comfortable the customer feels during the interaction with the company.
The results confirm a general increase in the degree of customer satisfaction with telephone services: the service satisfaction index is 85.9% (+1.2 compared to 2020); the "resolvability" of practices carried out at the call centre has also increased, rising from 85.3% in 2020 to 86.1% in 2021 (+0.8). As a result, the CES (Customer Effort Score) indicator, which summarises customer satisfaction in their interaction with Plenitude, continues to grow, reaching 86.6% (+0.7) in 2021. Furthermore, in 2021 Plenitudeconsolidated a customer feedback programme oriented towards lis- tening to customers at all touchpoints of the processes with which they come into contact with the Company, with the aim of bringing all people in the corporate organisation closer to the expectations and needs of customers, creating a common culture to transform the feedback received into value. CUSTOMER PROTECTION In 2021 Plenitude was again committed to providing consumers with a service that was strongly based on transparency and fairness, while also providing the right information and tools to identify and defend themselves against any improper behaviour. The anti-fraud hotline, activated in 2020, remained operational during 2021. 15,305 calls were received, of which 14,572 related to unfair commercial practices by unknown companies and 733 by known operators. In this area, the “Spotlight. Facciamo luce sull'energia" (Let's shed some light on energy) campaign was set up to warn the population against energy supply scams through a social and web campaign inside flagship stores and in a dedicated section of the Plenitude website.
SERVICE ASSESSMENT With regard to the call centre, customer satisfaction is monitored by Plenitude through a service assessment survey based on daily interviews with a representative sample of customers.
SATISFACTION OF CUSTOMERS REGARDING TELEPHONE SERVICES. 
Eni Stations, today distributed in over 4,000 points of sale throughout Italy and about 1,200 abroad, with their wide range of services and technological assets, are the result of continuous evolution and the ability to renew. The new Eni Mobility Point concept is fundamental for Eni to achieve its decarbonisation objectives, involving customers, informing them and supporting them in the use of products with a low environmental impact, in order to make them more aware of their own choices and consumption habits.
Eni has revamped its Eni Stations to increase travel efficiency and optimise the time dedicated to using its services. In fact, the new service aims to accommodate personal needs. Thus, Eni Stations have been transformed from refuelling points to multi-service centres, where customers can take a quick break in one of the 600 Eni cafés, do some shopping in the Emporium proximity shop, collect packages purchased online, pay bills or withdraw cash (thanks to the partnership with Poste Italiane), order, receive or re- place their Telepass at the over 300 Eni Telepass points, and use the car sharing mobility service, Enjoy, available in Milan, Rome, Turin, Florence and Bologna. Technology and digitalisation also play a fundamental role in the evolution of Eni Stations and with the support of apps (Enjoy or Eni station+) refuelling will be increasingly automated, efficient and secure, through digital payments. Eni Multicards will be transformed into payment cards for products or services in Eni Stations.

Reporting criteria. 
REPORTING PRINCIPLES Standards, guidelines and recommendations. Eni for is prepared in compliance with the “Sustainability Reporting Standards” of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI Standards) according to principles of balance, comparability, accuracy, timeliness, reliability and clarity (reporting principles). The level of compliance adopted is "in accordance Core" and has been subjected to a limited review by the independent auditors, who also audited the consolidated financial statements and the Consolidated Non-Financial Statement (NFI) as at December 31, 2021. All GRI indicators in the Content Index see pp. 49-57, refer to the version of the GRI Standards published in 2016, with the exception of those of: (i) “Standard 403: Health and safety at work”, (ii) “Standard 303: Water and water discharges" - which refer to the 2018 edition, (iii) "Standard 207: Taxes" of 2019 and (iv) "Standard 306: Waste” in 2020. Moreover, a reference table with the TCFD recommendations, implemented in Eni for 2021 Carbon neutrality by 2050, is reported on see p. 58. In continuity with last year, two reference tables have been included: one with the “core” metrics defined by the World Economic Forum (WEF) in its White Paper “Measuring Stakeholder Capitalism - Towards Common Metrics and Consistent Reporting of Sustainable Value Creation” see pp. 59-60 and the other with the metrics of SASB Exploration & Production standards see pp. 61-62. Finally, as of this year, Eni will publish a table containing the indicators required by the EU Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR). see pp. 63-64. 
Key performance indicators. KPI are selected based on the topics identified as most significant, are collected on an annual basis according to the consolidation scope of the reference year and refer to the period 2017-2021. In general, trends in data and performance indicators are also calculated using decimal places not shown in the document. The same data and indicators (reported in Eni for reports) are presented with a decimal approximation that can lead to negligible deviations between the sum of the individual contributions and the total published. The data for the year 2021 are the best possible estimate with the data available at the time of preparation of this report. In addition, some data published in previous years may be subject to restatement in this edition for one of the following reasons: refinement/change in estimation or calculation methods, significant changes in the consolidation scope, or if significant updated information becomes available. If a restatement is made, the reasons for it must be appropriately disclosed in the text. Most of the KPIs present are collected and aggregated automatically through the use of specific company software. It is recalled that in 2021 Eni published, for the fifth consecutive year, the NFI in accordance with the requirements of Italian Legislative Decree 254/2016. This Statement constitutes a separate section of the Management Report included in the Annual Report. The integration of non-financial information in the Annual Report is a path that Eni has been following since 2010.
REPORTING BOUNDARY The boundary of the key performance indicators is aligned with the objectives set by the company and represents the potential impact of the activities Eni manages. In particular, for KPIs relating to safety, the environment and climate, the boundary is made up of companies with HSE impacts and includes: (i) companies in joint operations, jointly controlled or associated companies in which Eni has control over operations and (ii) Eni subsidiaries with HSE risk(33). With regard to health, the data consider the companies with health impacts and companies under joint operation or joint control or associates in which Eni has control of operations (with the sole exception of data relating to occupational illness reports, which refer to fully consolidated companies only). The boundary of data relating to anti-corruption training, local development investments and the number of Countries in which Eni supports EITI relates to the reporting companies in which these activities are conducted. The boundary of data referred to whistleblowing reports relate to Eni SpA and its subsidiaries. The boundary of data referred to internal audits covering the anti-corruption checks includes controlled subsidiaries, associated companies based on specific agreements and third parties deemed to have a higher risk, as provided for under the contracts entered with Eni. Finally, the indicators relating to people, human rights and suppliers refer to the data of fully consolidated companies.

KPI Metodology. 
GOVERNANCE AND BUSINESS ETHICS. 
Diversity in the control bodies Outside of Italy, only the companies with a control body similar to the Board of Statutory Auditors according to the Italian law were considered.
Economic value The economic value generated represents the wealth generated by the Company in carrying out its activities. A significant part of this value is in turn distributed (distributed economic value), in the form of: operating costs, wages and salaries for employees, payments to capital suppliers and payments to the Public Administration. The residual portion of economic value generated that is not distributed constitutes retained economic value. All the components of these indicators are calculated with reference to the individual items of the Financial Statements published in Eni's Consolidated Financial Report.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. 
Research and development The tangible value generated by R&D is measured by the economic benefits related to the application of innovative production/process technologies. The total value generated is divided into: a) actual benefits and b) expected benefits. Actual benefits are applied to 100% of the investment in technological applications projects and before tax. On the other hand, expected benefits are associated with: (i) investment projects that employ innovative technologies; (ii) reductions in expenditures envisaged from abandoning Upstream infrastructures and are calculated in terms of Net Present Value (NPV) at 100% of the investment and before tax; and (iii) increases in 2P reserves calculated by reproportioning Eni’s share of the unit NPV/boe to 100% using the SEC methodology. The latter include the benefit deriving from the application of applied technologies in exploration, which contribute to increasing the success rate and the associated values. The tangible benefits are identified in a “what if” scenario, namely as the difference compared to the application of the best alternative technology available on the market or, in the case of new products, as the difference compared to the margin derived from the sale of the new product net of any products replaced.
KPI Metodology. 
CARBON NEUTRALITY BY 2050. 
GHG emissions Scope 1: direct GHG emissions are those deriving from sources associated to the company's assets (e.g. combustion, flaring, fugitive and venting), and include CO2, CH4 and N2O; the Global Warming Potential used for conversion to CO2 equivalent is 25 for CH4 and 298 for N2O. I. Contributions of biogenic CO2 emissions are not included. Scope 2: are the indirect GHG emissions related to the generation of electricity, steam and heat purchased by third parties and intended for internal consumption. Scope 3: indirect GHG emissions associated with the value chain of Eni’s products, which involve an analysis by category of activity. In the oil & gas sector, the most significant category is that related to the use of energy products (end-use), which Eni calculates according to internationally consolidated methodologies (GHG Protocol and IPIECA), based on upstream production.
Emission Intensity. 
Indicators consider the direct GHG emissions (Scope 1) related to assets operated by Eni, which include CO2, CH4 and N2O, accounted for on a 100% basis. • Upstream: indicator focused on emissions associated to development and production of hydrocarbons. Denominator refers to gross operated production. • R&M: indicator focused on emissions related to traditional and biorefineries. Denominator refers to refinery throughputs (raw and semi- finished materials). • EniPower: indicator focused on emissions related to electricity and steam production of thermoelectric plants. Denominator refers to equivalent electricity produced (excluding the Bolgiano cogeneration plant).
Operational Efficiency. 
Operational efficiency expresses the intensity of GHG emissions (Scope 1 and Scope 2 in tonCO2eq.) of the main industrial activities operated by Eni divided by the productions (converted by homogeneity into barrels of oil equivalent using Eni’s average conversion factors) of the single businesses of reference, thus measuring their degree of operating efficiency in a decarbonization scenario. In particular, the following specifications apply: • Upstream: includes the hydrocarbon production and electricity plants; • R&M: includes only refineries; • Chemicals: includes all plants; • EniPower: includes thermoelectric plants except for the Bolgiano cogeneration plant. Differently from the other emission intensity indicators, which refer to single businesses and consider only GHG Scope 1 emissions, the operating efficiency index effectively measures Eni’s commitment for reducing its GHG emission intensity by including also Scope 2 emissions.
Energy Consumption. 
Consumption of primary sources: sum of consumption of primary sources such as fuel gas, natural gas, refinery/process gas, LPG, light distillates/petrol, diesel, etc. Primary energy purchased from other companies: Sum of purchases of electricity, heat and steam from third parties. Consumption from renewable sources also depends on the national electricity mix.
CALCULATION METHODS. 
OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE ALLIANCES FOR DEVELOPMENT CARBON NEUTRALITY INTRODUCTION 45. 
ENI FOR 2021 SUSTAINABILITY PERFORMANCE


KPI Metodology. 
Energy Intensity. 
The refining energy intensity index represents the total amount of energy actually used in the reference year among the various refinery processing plants, divided by the corresponding value of preset standard consumption values for each processing plant. To allow comparison over the years, 2009 data is taken as a reference (100%). For other sectors, the index represents the ratio between significant energy consumption associated to operated plants and the related production.
Net carbon Footprint. 
Eni net carbon footprint: the indicator considers GHG Scope 1+2 emissions associated to hydrocarbons development and production activities, operated by Eni and by third parties, accounted for on an equity basis (Revenue Interest), net of offsets mainly deriving from Natural Climate Solutions occurred in the reference reporting year. Net carbon footprint upstream: the indicator considers the GHG Scope 1+2 emissions associated to hydrocarbon development and production activities operated or not by Eni, accounted for on an equity basis (revenue interest) and net of the offsets mainly deriving from Natural Climate Solutions occurred in the reference year.
Net ghg lifecycle emissions. 
The indicator refers to GHG Scope 1+2+3 emissions associated with the value chain of the energy products sold by Eni, including both those deriving from own productions and those purchased from third parties, accounted for on an equity basis, net of offsets mainly deriving from Natural Climate Solutions. Differently from Scope 3 end-use emissions, which Eni reports based on upstream production, the Net GHG Lifecycle Emissions indicator considers a much wider perimeter, including Scope 1, 2 and Scope 3 emissions referred to the whole value chain of energy products sold by Eni, thus including Scope 3 end-use emissions associated to gas purchased by third parties and petroleum products sold by Eni.
Net carbon Intensity. 
The indicator, accounted for on an equity basis, is defined as the ratio between Net GHG Lifecycle Emissions (see Net GHG Lifecycle Emissions definition) and the energy content of the products sold by Eni.
Renewable Installed Capacity. 
The indicator is measured as the maximum generating capacity of Eni’s share power plants that use renewable energy sources (wind, solar and wave, and any other non-fossil fuel source of generation deriving from natural resources, excluding nuclear energy) to produce electricity. The capacity is considered “installed” once the power plants are in operation or the mechanical completion phase has been reached. The mechanical completion represents the final construction stage excluding the grid connection.
KPI Metodology. 
OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE. 
PEOPLE. 
Employement Eni uses a large number of Contractors to carry out the activities within its own Sites.
Industrial relations Regarding industrial relations, the minimum notice period for operational changes is in line with the provisions of the laws in force and the trade union agreements signed in the Countries in which Eni operates. Employees covered by collective bargaining: are those employees whose employment relationship is governed by collective agreements or contracts, whether national, industry, Company or site. This is the only KPI dedicated to people that considers role-based employees (Company with which the employee enters into the employment contract). All others, including indicators on training, are calculated according to the utilisation method (Company where the work is actually done). It should be noted that, using this second method, the two aspects (role companies and service) could coincide.
Seniority Average number of years worked by employees at Eni and its subsidiaries.
Training hours Hours provided to Eni SpA and subsidiaries employees through training courses managed and carried out by Eni Corporate University (classroom and remote) and through activities carried out by the organizational units of Eni's Business areas/ Companies independently, also through on-the-job training. Average training hours are calculated as total training hours divided by the average number of employees in the year. 
Local senior and middle managers Abroad. 
Number of local senior managers + middle managers (employees born in the Country in which their main working activity is based) divided by total employment abroad.
Turnover rate Ratio of the number of Hires + Terminations of permanent contracts and the permanent employment contracts of the previous year.
Replacement rate Ratio of number of hiring and termination of permanent contracts.
HEALTH. 
Health Number of occupational disease claims filed by heirs: indicator used as a proxy for the number of deaths due to occupational diseases. Recordable cases of occupational diseases: number of occupational disease reports. Main types of diseases: reports of suspected occupational disease made known to the employer concern pathologies that may have a causal connection with the risk at work, as they may have been contracted in the course of work and due to prolonged exposure to risk agents present in the workplace. The risk may be caused by the processing carried out,or by the environment in which the processing takes place. The main risk agents whose prolonged exposure may lead to an occupational disease are: (i) chemical agents (example of disease: neoplasms, respiratory system diseases, blood diseases); (ii) biological agents (example of disease: malaria); (iii) physical agents (example of disease: hearing loss).

KPI Metodology. 
SAFETY. 
Safety Eni uses a large number of contractors to carry out the activities within its own sites. TRIR: total recordable injury rate (injuries leading to days of absence, medical treatments and cases of work limitations). Numerator: number of total recordable injuries; denominator: hours worked in the same period. Result of the ratio multiplied by 1,000,000. High-consequence work-related injuries rate: injuries at work with days of absence exceeding 180 days or resulting in tot al or permanent disability. Numerator: number of injuries at work with serious consequences; denominator: hours worked in the same period. Result of the ratio multiplied by 1,000,000. Near miss: an incidental event, the origin, execution and potential effect of which is accidental in nature, but which is however different from an accident only in that the result has not proved damaging, due to luck or favourable circumstances, or to the mitigating intervention of technical and/or organizational protection systems. Accidental events that do not turn into accidents or injuries are therefore considered to be near misses. The main hazards detected in 2021 in Eni concern: • falling (ground level); • shock, impact, crushing during the use of equipment; • load lifting. For the assessment of accident KPIs, in addition to the GRI standard, Eni adopts and integrates, through its own internal procedures, the IOGP guidelines on work-relatedness events, also taking into account country risk.
ENVIRONMENT. 
Water Resources. 
Water withdrawals: sum of sea water, freshwater, and brackish water from subsoil or surface withdrawn. TAF (groundwater treatment plant) water represents the amount of polluted groundwater treated and reused in the production cycle. The limit for freshwater, which is more conservative than that indicated by the GRI reference standard (equal to 1,000 ppm), is 2,000 ppm TDS, as provided in the IPIECA/ API/IOGP 2020 guidance. Water discharges: The internal procedures relating to the operational management of water discharges regulate the control of the minimum quality standards and the authorization limits prescribed for each operational site, ensuring that they are respected and promptly resolved if they are exceeded.
Biodiversity Number of sites overlapping with protected areas and Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs): R&M, Versalis and EniPower operational sites and pipelines in Italy and abroad, which are located within (or partially within) the boundaries of one or more protected areas or KBAs (December of each reference year). Number of sites adjacent to protected areas or Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs): R&M, Versalis and EniPower operational sites in Italy and abroad which, although outside the boundaries of protected areas or KBA, are less than 1 km away (December of each reference year). Number of upstream concessions overlapping protected areas and Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs), with activities in the overlapping area: active national and international concessions, operated, under development or in production, present in the Company's databases in June of each reference year that overlap one or more protected areas or KBAs, where development/production operations (wells, sealines, pipelines and onshore and offshore installations as documented in the Company's GIS geodatabase) are located within the intersection area. Number of upstream concessions overlapping protected areas or Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs), without activities in the overlapping area: active national and international concessions, operated, under development or in production, present in the Company's databases in June of each reference year that overlap one or more protected areas or KBAs, where development/production operations (wells, sealines, pipelines and onshore and offshore installations as documented in the Company's GIS geodatabase) are located outside the intersection area. The sources used for the census of protected areas and KBAs are the "World Database on Protected Areas" and the "World Database of Key Biodiversity Areas" respectively; the data was made available to Eni in the framework of its membership in the UNEP-WCMC Proteus Partnership (UN Environment Programme – World Conservation Monitoring Center). There are some limitations to consider when interpreting the results of this analysis: • it is globally recognized that there is an overlap between the different databases of protected areas and KBAs, which may have led to a certain degree of duplication in the analysis (some protected areas/KBAs could be counted several times); • the databases of protected or key biodiversity areas used for the analysis, while representing the most up-to-date information available at global level, may not be complete for each Country. 
Spill Spills from primary or secondary containment into the environment of oil or petroleum derivative from refining or oil waste occurring during operation or as a result of sabotage, theft or vandalism. Specifically, in 2021, volumes spilled by operational spill impacted 97% soil and 3% water body, those due to sabotage impacted 99,8% soil and 0,2% water body.
Waste Waste from production: waste from production activities, including waste from drilling activities and construction sites. Waste from remediation activities: this includes waste from soil securing and remediation activities, demolition and groundwater classified as waste. The waste disposal method is communicated to Eni by the third party authorised for disposal.
Air protection NOx: total direct emissions of nitrogen oxide due to combustion processes with air. It includes emissions of NOx from flaring activities, sulphur recovery processes, FCC regeneration, etc. It includes emissions of NO and NO2, excluding N2O. SOx: total direct emissions of sulphur oxides, including emissions of SO2 and SO3. NMVOC: total direct emissions of hydrocarbons, hydrocarbon substitutes and oxygenated hydrocarbons that evaporate at normal temperature. They include LPG and exclude methane. PST: direct emissions of Total Suspended Particulates, finely divided solid or liquid material suspended in gaseous flows. Standard emission factors.
HUMAN RIGHTS. 
Security Contracts with Human rights Clauses. 
The indicator "percentage of security contracts with human rights clauses" is obtained by calculating the ratio between the "Number of security and security porter contracts with human rights clauses" and the "Total number of security and security porter contracts".

KPI Metodology. 
Whistleblowing Reports. 
The indicator refers to the whistleblowing files relating to Eni SpA and its subsidiaries, closed during the year and relating to Human Rights; of the files thus identified, the number of separate assertion is reported as a result of the investigation conducted on the facts reported (founded, partially founded, unfounded, not ascertainble and not applicable).
SUPPLIERS. 
Suppliers subjected to assessment. 
The indicator represents all suppliers subject to a Due Diligence or subject to a qualification process or subject to a performance evaluation feedback on HSE or Compliance areas or subject to a feedback process or subject to an assessment on human rights issues (inspired by the SA 8000 standard or similar certification), for which the Vendor Management activities are centralized in Eni SpA (e.g. all Italian, mega and international suppliers) or are carried out locally by foreign subsidiaries with a vendor management function and operating on VMS at least on the qualification module for more than one year (Eni Ghana, Eni Pakistan, Eni US and Eni Angola, Eni México S. de RL de CV, IEOC, Eni Australia and Eni Nigeria (NAOC)). The perimeter is progressively extended each year as the VMS system is deployed.
New suppliers Evaluated according To social criteria. 
This indicator is included in the "Suppliers subject to assessment" indicator and represents all new suppliers subjected to a new qualification process.
Spending to local suppliers. 
The indicator refers to the 2021 share of expenditure to local suppliers. "Spending to local suppliers" has been defined according to the following alternative methods on the basis of the specific characteristics of the Countries analysed: 1)"Equity method" (Ghana): the share of expenditure towards local suppliers is determined on the basis of the percentage of ownership of the corporate structure (e.g. for a Joint Venture with 60% local components, 60% of total expenditure towards the Joint Venture is considered as expenditure towards local suppliers); 2) "Local currency method” (Angola, Vietnam and the UK): the share paid in local currency is identified as expenditure towards local suppliers; 3) "Country registration method" (Iraq, Indonesia, United Arab Emirates, Nigeria, Mozambique and the USA): the expenditure towards suppliers registered in the Country and not belonging to international groups/mega suppliers (e.g. suppliers of drilling services/auxiliary drilling services) is identified as local; 4) "Method of registration in the Country + local currency" (Congo and Mexico): expenditure towards suppliers registered in the Country and not belonging to international groups/mega suppliers (e.g. suppliers of drilling services) is identified as local. For the latter, spending in local currency is considered to be local. The selected countries are Ghana, Angola, UK, Iraq, Nigeria, Congo, Mexico, Mozambique, USA, Indonesia, UAE and Vietnam. The Countries selected are those most representative for Eni business from a strategic point of view and in which a relevant procurement plan for the four-year period 21-24 has been recorded compared to the total spent by the Eni Group.
TRANSPARENCY, ANTI-CORRUPTION AND TAX STRATEGY.
