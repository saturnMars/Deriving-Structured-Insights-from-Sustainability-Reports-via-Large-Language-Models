INTRODUCTION. 
At Fox Corporation, our responsibility to be an active and engaged corporate citizen is held as a core value, and FOX has cultivated the kind of relationship with our viewers, employees and stakeholders that provides us with opportunities to positively affect our communities. Our commitment to corporate social responsibility has continued to grow in the three years since the company was established through the expansion of FOX Forward, our company-wide philanthropic initiative.
This year, our FOX Forward initiatives were focused on three pillars: serving veterans and active-duty military members, enhancing educational opportunities for underserved students and investing in our local communities through our partnerships, financial donations, volunteer efforts and magnification across our media assets.
The power of FOX Forward and the FOX brand was perhaps best exemplified by our efforts to support the American Red Cross’ Humanitarian Aid efforts in. 
Ukraine earlier this year. We kicked off our fundraising campaign with a $1 million corporate gift to the Red Cross, but it was soon matched by more than tenfold. In just two weeks, over $13 million was raised by our employees and our viewers through a giving campaign that ran across every FOX platform, in daytime, primetime and online. The passion and generosity of our extended FOX Family was truly overwhelming, and the money raised represented nearly a third of the funds donated to the Red Cross’ humanitarian effort in the region.
While FOX Forward’s mission is to positively impact the lives of the people and the communities it serves, it also benefits our employees and various stakeholders. Our team members report being gratified by our community engagement and actively volunteer their own time and resources in support of this unifying work. Further, the impact we make through FOX Forward deepens our viewers’ appreciation of our brands.
In addition to showcasing our FOX Forward initiatives for the last year, this report will highlight FOX’s forward-thinking efforts in sustainability, employee benefits and resources, data security and more. In thinking holistically about our stakeholders, our strategic business objectives and our capacity for driving measurable impact, we are able to focus our resources to make meaningful advances in these key areas.
We will continue to do our part as a citizen of the global community and to move FOX forward together.

OUR APPROACH. 
Fox Corporation (FOX) continually endeavors to positively impact the communities we serve and to conduct our business in a sustainable and responsible manner.
By leveraging our assets and maximizing employee engagement, we are focused on impacting communities through, among other things, veterans and military initiatives, global disaster relief assistance, support of food insecurity programs and by nurturing the next generation of storytellers and creators. We partner with trusted, leading non-profit organizations committed to impacting the areas closest to our homes and our hearts, with a particular focus on Los Angeles and New York City, where we have our largest footprint.
This Corporate Social Responsibility Report provides an annual summary of our shared value approach to our corporate giving, environmental, social and governance (ESG) activities. In addition to describing the commitments and investments that we believe are critical to the long-term sustainability of our business and our positive impact on our communities, this report also addresses and is guided by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) criteria, found on page 45. We also report through programs such as Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), a global environmental disclosure system, and engage with ESG research analysts, including MSCI and Sustainalytics, regarding our approach.
The FOX Corporate Social Responsibility Report covers our activities during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2022 (FY2022), except as otherwise noted. Calendar years (CY) are marked as such or written in a four-digit format.

VETERANS & FIRST RESPONDERS FOX, in its current form as Fox Corporation and in previous corporate formations, is a vocal and active advocate for the veteran, active-duty military and first responder communities and the caregivers and service organizations who support them. In addition to our work in Los Angeles with U.S.VETS, our employees, our networks and our audiences consistently rally to support and thank members of our armed services.
YOUTH & EDUCATION FOX supports the education and creative development of the next generation of storytellers and creative leaders. In bringing the depth of the creative expertise as well as the resources of FOX into the classroom, we are able to create opportunities for students to explore their passion and define their voice. While we look to develop a passion for storytelling and a curiosity about their world at large, we are also aware that many students struggle to have their basic needs met to facilitate their learning. FOX is committed to filling in the gaps for those students in our community.
SERVING OUR COMMUNITY The FOX Studio Lot, with its rich and storied history, has long been a vital part of the Los Angeles community. Over the decades, tens of thousands of writers, actors, engineers, directors and other FOX colleagues have left their marks creatively and through their commitment to the surrounding area. We are committed to the well-being of our neighbors and support the local youth, residents, small businesses and community organizations around each of our business headquarters, including the cities that are home to all 18 Owned & Operated stations. Our legacy is one we continue to nurture and grow in and around the FOX Studio Lot.

Additionally, our FOX Giving Program matches contributions (dollar for dollar) made by eligible employees to verified non-profit organizations, up to $1,000 per person annually. Over the course of the fiscal year, contributions through our FOX Giving Program exceeded $1.5 million, attributed to employee donations and volunteer rewards, with the Company’s match doubling, and in some select campaigns, tripling the impact of our employees’ contributions to the causes they care most about.

MAKE CAMO YOUR CAUSE In Action. 
FOX partnered with U.S.VETS for their “Make Camo Your Cause” campaign to #HONORUSVETS. The cause marketing campaign, launched in November of 2021, brings visibility to the organization’s mission to further establish camouflage as the official symbol of veteran support. FOX activated widespread support across our networks and businesses in support of the campaign and the organization’s goal to end homelessness for those who have served.

FOX continues its pledge to pre-invest in national disaster relief through our American Red Cross Annual Disaster Giving Program (ADGP) partnership. Our annual gift supports relief efforts in response to disasters across the nation, providing safe shelter, hot meals, emotional support and resources to aid in recovery.
The ADGP funds the Red Cross response efforts to more than 60,000 disasters of all sizes each year across the nation, helping families and communities become better prepared and more resilient ahead of the next crisis. Vital systems and supplies must be in place before disaster strikes, and FOX’s dedication and critical investments ensure that the tens of thousands of Red Cross workers are fully ready to turn heartbreak into hope.
Those struggling after a disaster turn to the Red Cross because they know they will get the support they need to begin to rebuild their lives. The Red Cross is dedicated to engaging local communities, evidenced by the fact that 90% of Red Cross workers are volunteers. FOX’s participation in the ADGP allows volunteers to be fully trained to jump into action to help those struggling in their own neighborhoods.

FOX NEWS MEDIA FOX News Media (FNM) reaches across multiple platforms to inform its audience and provides opportunities for its loyal viewers to give back to the worthy organizations they are passionate about. Through contributions, awareness and employee volunteerism, FNM made a wide impact during the year.
FOX NEWS MEDIA 25TH ANNIVERSARY WEEK OF SERVICE In keeping with the values of service and teamwork, FNM celebrated its 25th Anniversary by giving back to local and national organizations through donations and volunteer activations. FNM contributed $100,000 to four non-profit partners, which was matched by FOX. FNM employees participated in volunteer activities, both in person and virtually, to support foster children, veterans experiencing homelessness, low-income youth, food insecure communities and deployed troops and their families.
• Together We Rise: Employees created and decorated ‘birthday boxes’ and ‘safer at home’ kits for kids currently in foster care. Together We Rise transforms the way children experience foster care through programs designed to bring joy and make them feel seen and appreciated.
• Blankets of Hope (BoH): FNM staffers worked with BoH to pair handwritten notes with hundreds of blankets for veterans experiencing homelessness. A FOX & Friends appearance by BoH founders resulted in over $50,000 in viewer donations and more than 200 educators committing to initiate the program in their classrooms.
• Operation Gratitude: FNM volunteers built Battalion Buddies bears for children of deployed military members, and additional virtual volunteers created paracord bracelets for deployed troops and veterans.

• Police Athletic League of NYC (PAL): FNM colleagues gathered to build snack packs for children in PAL programs in the Bronx. Employees also joined remotely for a special Lunch & Learn session from the PAL team and were able to purchase items from their Amazon Wishlist. Through the on-site and virtual events, over 600 packs were created for students. FNM has long supported PAL’s mission to provide environments for NYC’s youth to play, learn and grow, nurtured by a special relationship with youth development professionals and police officers.
• Feeding America: Through a FOX Giving employee match campaign, over 10,000 meals were donated to food banks through Feeding America.
• Additionally, employee donations to all FNM Anniversary Week of Service non-profit partners were matched by the company, subsequently raising over $20,000.
SAVE OUR ALLIES FNM journalist Benjamin Hall, who was seriously injured while reporting on the ground in Ukraine, was evacuated safely by the bravery, compassion and heroism of Save Our Allies, as well as the U.S. military and the Ukrainian and Polish Armed Forces.
Save Our Allies was established in 2021 in direct response to the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan. The non-profit group operates with a mission to rescue American citizens and other special populations from conflict zones with veterans of the special operations and the intelligence community who are highly skilled in precision evacuations in hostile environments.
In appreciation of their incredible efforts, FOX News Media launched a voluntary employee fundraising drive for Save Our Allies with a double match from Fox Corporation which raised over $30,000.

HIDDEN HEROES FOX Forward partnered with the Elizabeth Dole Foundation in support of their “Hidden Heroes” initiative, which brings vital attention to the untold stories of military caregivers and seeks solutions for the tremendous challenges and long-term needs they face.
During the December 2021 holiday season, FOX Forward awarded special grants to extraordinary caretakers from seven families across the U.S. During FOX TV Station on-air interviews about the program, the spotlight was turned on the caretakers, surprising them with a grant in recognition of their dedication to supporting our nation’s heroes, often in the shadows and without fanfare.
The program recognizes the needs of caretakers, helping them avoid burnout, manage stress and take care of their physical and mental health, so they can continue providing care to their loved ones.
FLEET WEEK Through continued partnership with the USO and the LA Fleet Week Foundation, FOX honored thousands of United States Navy, United States Marine Corps and United States Coast Guard participating in Fleet Week celebrations on the East and West coasts.

FOX Entertainment joined as a sponsor of the Galley Wars Surf and Turf Grill Challenge. The competition between Navy, Marine, Coast Guard and Army teams was judged by a celebrity panel, including a past MasterChef contestant. Held at the Port of Los Angeles, more than 60,000 attendees and service members enjoyed the events during the four-day Memorial Day weekend.

Support for Tunnel to Towers is a true FOX family effort. Fox Corporation, FOX News Media and FOX Sports’ sponsorship of annual events around their 9/11 commemorations exceeded over $1 million.

FOX has developed and implemented a number of internal training programs designed to provide outstanding individuals with workforce skills and professional development opportunities. These programs build the pipeline of our next generation of leaders, many of whom are from underrepresented backgrounds. Examples include:
FOX Ad Sales Training (FAST): This rotational program, which hired its first class in early 2021, aims to attract, develop and retain early career talent. Through exposure to various functions within Ad Sales, FAST develops professional skills of promising individuals recruited from outside FOX.
FOX Alternative Entertainment (FAE) FASTRACK: This highly selective accelerated producers’ initiative is designed to nurture producers with diverse backgrounds and life experiences and create a pipeline for new behind-the-camera talent on FAE series. Launched in 2020, the program places candidates as associate producers on production teams across various FAE-produced shows to provide valuable exposure to many facets of production.
FOX News Leadership Development Program: This program equips diverse, high-potential talent with the tools needed to build and propel a career with FOX. Program pillars are mentorship, access and networking, skill-building and development and exposure to the other FOX businesses.
FOX News Media Career Launch Program: Initiated in August 2021, this program strives to set up early-career talent for success by providing tools and resources that empower them to navigate their own career journey and become well-rounded employees who contribute to the long-term success of FOX News Media.
FOX News Media Digital Rotational Program: Launched in June 2021, this program strives to identify high potential talent from diverse backgrounds with a passion for the FOX News Media brand. The goal is to find staff placement for the individuals who complete the one-year rotational program across three key departments for four months each and have proven themselves to be integral members of the FOX News Media Digital team.
FOX News Media High-Octane Mentoring Program: Under the mentorship of executive leadership team members, mentees who exhibit a track record of consistently high performance and collaborative and inclusive leadership within their teams are provided with opportunities to build their business acumen and leadership competencies. Launched in October 2021, this program aims to engage, retain and prepare high potential talent for continued growth within FOX News Media.
FOX News Multimedia Reporters Training Program: This program places talent from diverse backgrounds in multimedia reporter roles across the country, where they shoot, report, edit and produce their own high- end content across FOX News platforms. Through daily guidance and feedback from management, we challenge and enable talent to continually hone their journalistic skill.
FOX Sports Professional Development Program: This program prepares production team leaders with skills for the unique sports production environment, such as communication and influence in the control room under short deadlines.
FOX Television Stations Sales Training Program: This program was created to develop and mentor the next generation of diverse and motivated sales professionals for FOX Television Stations.

FOX also facilitates Employee Resource Groups (ERGs), which are formed around shared identity, interests or pursuits. These ERGs advance careers, form a more inclusive workplace community and foster a sense of belonging. FOX offers nine Employee Resource Groups: • ABLE -- promotes an inclusive environment and culture for our colleagues with disabilities through advocacy and allyship • ACE (Asian Community Exchange) -- serves Asian Americans at FOX by advancing our members, championing our stories and empowering our communities • BLK+ -- celebrates our Black colleagues and seeks to build community through programming and professional development while standing in solidarity with our allies • HOLA (Hispanic Organization for Leadership and Advancement) -- develops Hispanic leaders, enriches FOX’s diverse culture and drives positive impact • PRIDE -- cultivates community among FOX’s LGBTQ+ colleagues and allies, supports causes important to the LGBTQ+ community and fosters a work environment where all colleagues feel 100% authentic and professionally supported • VETS -- is committed to the community of veterans, current service members, military supporters and military spouses employed at FOX by embracing our four core values – Community, Appreciation, Connection & Education • WiT (Women in Tech) -- attracts, advances and empowers women technologists and amplifies their impact at FOX • Women of FOX Sports -- connects, inspires, informs and gives back to the community, with the goal of furthering women’s collective contributions and advancement within the sports industry • WOMEN@FOX -- creates the space for developing female leadership at all levels and fosters a culture where all women thrive. 
As a result of these and other efforts, many outside organizations have recognized FOX for our deep commitment to inclusion and diversity. For example: • DiversityComm once again recognized FOX as a Top Employer and as a Top LGBTQ+ Friendly Company for 2022 • The Company was appointed to the Military Friendly® Employer list again for 2022 and named one of its 2022 top ten employers • FOX was named to Disability Equality Index's “Best Places to Work for Disability Inclusion” list again for 2022 • Black EOE Journal, HISPANIC Network Magazine, Professional WOMAN’s Magazine and U.S. Veterans Magazine have all listed FOX as a 2022 top employer. 
Finally, we understand that inclusion and diversity should influence the way we purchase goods and services. We are a member of the National Minority Supplier Development Council and its Advertising, Entertainment, Media and Sports industry group, and we invite minority business enterprises to engage with us and be part of our vendor base. Our goal is to identify and grow a diverse supplier community that provides us best-in-class goods and services. We engage employees, suppliers, partners and stakeholders through education, training, interaction and leadership initiatives that foster an inclusive culture and environment. We also seek to build business opportunities and lasting relationships with companies owned and operated by women, veterans, people with disabilities and LGBTQ+ individuals.

We are proud to invest in our people through competitive pay and comprehensive benefits designed to attract, motivate and retain our talent.
FOX operates with an ownership mentality which is intended to encourage our entrepreneurial spirit and collegial approach, providing our employees with an environment where they can take creative risks and fulfill their own professional goals. Providing equal pay for equal work, without regard to race, gender or other protected characteristics, is an imperative at FOX. We link our more senior employees’ pay to corporate performance through discretionary annual incentive compensation awards.
We also provide a broad array of generous benefits that support the health, wellness and financial stability of our employees and their families. Full-time employees are eligible for medical insurance through a choice of several plans. Employees may enroll family members, including same- and opposite-sex domestic partners, in this coverage. Freelance employees who work a minimum number of hours are also eligible for a medical plan. Many employees enjoy the convenience of covered telemedicine visits. In addition, we provide vision and dental insurance, which includes coverage for adult orthodontic care. Our coverage is generous, with employee contributions and costs more favorable than national averages, according to a 2021 Mercer LLC survey. In addition, eligible employees may participate in flexible spending accounts, health savings accounts and qualified transportation expense accounts. We also provide employees with a health advocate service with experts who support employees and their eligible family members in navigating a wide range of health and insurance-related issues. In addition, we have onsite fitness centers in our New York and Los Angeles worksites.
To provide additional support during the pandemic, we paid full-time employees’ medical insurance premiums from March 2020 through December 2021.
Additional benefits that FOX provides to full-time employees include: • paid company holidays • paid floating holidays • paid vacation • paid sick and safe time • life insurance, accidental death and dismemberment insurance, and business travel accident insurance • full salary replacement for up to 26 weeks of shortterm disability • basic long-term disability insurance • tuition reimbursement • charitable gift matching • an employee assistance program, including onsite counseling in New York and Los Angeles, as well as smoking cessation and weight management programs • cybersecurity and malware protection for personal devices • Our 401(k) FOX Savings Plan provides employees with a company contribution, and it offers a company match, Roth and post-tax contribution options, catch-up contributions and a company match true-up feature. 
We believe offering our employees the tools necessary for a healthy work-life balance empowers them to thrive in our modern workforce. To that end, FOX allows eligible individuals the opportunity to work on a partially remote (i.e., “hybrid”) or fully remote basis in appropriate circumstances. We support these working arrangements by deploying online collaboration tools, offering e-learning courses on effective remote work, providing reasonable office supplies and reimbursing business expenses.
The Company also reimburses employees who work on a fully remote basis with a monthly stipend for business expenses (including mobile or other devices, Internet and electricity). Where appropriate, we provide technology and mobile communication devices, tailored to employee duties.
Our parental leave policy allows eligible new parents to bond with their children for a substantial period with full pay, and our workplaces have lactation rooms for our new mothers. We provide onsite subsidized childcare to full-time employees at the Los Angeles FOX Child Care Center. In addition, we offer backup child, adult and elder care benefits to help full-time employees with back-to-school transitions and caregiving support while managing remote work and virtual learning. Our coverage includes extra backup care to use during a child’s first year to assist with a parent’s return to work. For calendar years 2021 and 2022, we doubled the number of days that employees may use the backup care service from 20 to 40 days per year, and we also allow employees to use their backup care benefits for virtual tutoring.

FOX is committed to equal employment opportunities for all employees and applicants for employment. We comply with and exceed the International Labour Organization’s (ILO) conventions for eliminating discrimination in respect to employment and occupation.
Our commitment to creating and maintaining an environment free of discrimination and harassment begins at the highest leadership level of the Company and is embedded throughout our policies and practices. The FOX Standards of Business Conduct and the Preventing Harassment, Discrimination and Retaliation Policy, which are posted on our website, lay out our framework for addressing complaints and taking remedial measures as needed.
Our Standards of Business Conduct expressly state that FOX endeavors to ensure that the workplace “is free of bullying and harassment, whether the harassment is sexual in nature, or is based on any characteristic protected by applicable law.” It makes clear that it is our policy to “investigate promptly and thoroughly any complaint of discrimination or harassment and to take remedial measures if FOX determines that there has been a violation of FOX’s policy against such conduct.”
We are also committed to maintaining a workplace that treats all employees with dignity and respect, and is free from all forms of harassment, discrimination and retaliation. Our Preventing Harassment, Discrimination and Retaliation Policy protects individuals on the basis of a person’s actual or perceived race, religious creed, color, national origin, ancestry, citizenship, age, physical disability, mental disability, medical condition, genetic information, marital status, family status, caregiver status, sex (including pregnancy status, childbirth, breastfeeding, and related medical conditions), gender, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, sexual and reproductive health decisions, reproductive health decision-making, hair texture or hairstyles, military or veteran status, political affiliation, arrest or conviction record, union membership, unemployment status, credit history, status as a victim of domestic violence, stalking or sexual offenses, or any other legally protected characteristic.
Any employee or applicant who believes they have experienced or witnessed harassment, discrimination or retaliation, including as a bystander, must immediately report it to a manager in the Company’s Human Resources department or to one of several alternative reporting channels, including the confidential, thirdparty managed Alertline, which allows for anonymous reporting of concerns. Members of management who learn of harassing, discriminatory or retaliatory conduct from any source are required to report it immediately.
Reported concerns are investigated, and if FOX determines that a violation of this policy has occurred, we take appropriate remedial action. These reports and investigations are evaluated by the most senior members of FOX’s management team. The Chief Legal and Policy Officer must approve any settlement related to a violation of the FOX Standards of Business Conduct as well as claims related to sexual harassment or other forms of discrimination. Further, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors is informed of all matters that require the Chief Legal and Policy Officer’s approval.
The Board has also adopted a clawback policy, whereby the Compensation Committee has sole discretion to require reimbursement of all or any portion of any performance-based compensation or discretionary bonus paid to any executive for the period when the executive engaged in harassment, discrimination and/or retaliation, including the failure to respond to allegations or complaints of such behaviors. All new hires must complete training on the Preventing Harassment, Discrimination and Retaliation Policy, as well as compliance and business ethics, and existing employees must complete the training periodically.
FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION FOX has always been and will continue to be unequivocally committed to our employees and their right to freely associate with any third party. Indeed, our Preventing Harassment, Discrimination and Retaliation Policy forbids discrimination on the basis of political affiliation or union membership. We firmly adhere to the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). The NLRA and the subsequent Taft-Hartley Amendments protect rights of employees and employers in the private sector. The foundation of the NLRA includes the employees’ right to participate in protected, concerted activities, to discuss working conditions openly and to choose to be or not be associated and/or represented by a third-party representative without fear of discrimination or retaliation. Across FOX Entertainment, FOX Sports, FOX Television Stations and the FOX Studio Lot, we are a party to approximately 75 separate collective bargaining agreements that cover thousands of staff and freelance employees.

32 “It’s vital that we as leaders recognize the employees in a meaningful way, which truly spotlights their amazing contributions to the company as well as their communities at large.” - Suzanne Scott, CEO, FOX News Media. 
FOX NEWS MEDIA “SPOTLIGHT AWARDS” The FOX News Media Spotlight Awards is a peer-to-peer program established to recognize extraordinary employees who go above and beyond, inside and outside the workplace. Now an annual tradition, this year marked the first formal event to honor recipients of the Spotlight Awards.
The 2021 Spotlight Awards were held in memory of late cameraman and editor Pierre Zakrzewski. Pierre was named an Unsung Hero only a few months before he was tragically killed in March when his vehicle was struck by incoming fire outside Kyiv while covering Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Zakrzewski, nominated by multiple employees for his outstanding coverage of conflict zones, was a much-loved forward thinker with an impressive knowledge of foreign territories and a keen ability for problem solving.
Spotlight Awards recipients included employees from across FOX News Media businesses, from executive producers to production assistants, who were nominated by their peers eager to celebrate and honor their teammates. Awards were given in six categories: Community Service, Rising Stars, Unsung Heroes, Innovator of the Year, Inclusion Ambassador of the Year and Impact Award.

We are committed to operating efficiently and reducing environmental risks associated with our operations across all our businesses.

During FY2022, we: • Completed our second carbon footprint study, which has helped identify trends, hot spots and feasible reduction targets to set.
• Provided additional transparency into our activities and best practice certifications. We engaged a consultant to perform an ISO 14001 gap analysis and have begun implementation of our environmental management system.

ENVIRONMENTAL EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT. 
ONE TREE PLANTED Race for Reforestation and FOX Weather Collaboration For a third consecutive year, FOX partnered with One Tree Planted to support their mission to restore forests and create habitats for biodiversity, making it simple for our employees to help the environment through tree planting.
To kick off Earth Month, FOX hosted an employee webinar with the Chief Environmental Evangelist, President and Founder of One Tree Planted, Matt Hill. FOX employees learned about One Tree Planted’s mission and how they are working to make an impact on the environment.
Through FOX’s virtual Race for Reforestation, employees recorded close to 2,000 miles during the month of April 2022. For each race mile, one tree was planted, helping us plant nearly 2,000 trees. Additionally, FOX supported two community planting events during Earth Month, bringing our total number of trees planted to 20,000.
FOX Weather also teamed with One Tree Planted during Earth Month to replant trees in Mayfield, Kentucky, after a devastating tornado tore through the town in December of 2021. The FOX Weather team returned to Mayfield several times throughout the year to support the community as the town continues to rebuild.

ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY (EHS) PROGRAM. 
Environmental management at FOX is guided by our enterprise-wide EHS Policy and EHS Management System.
The ultimate responsibility and authority for establishing and maintaining effective EHS programs rests with our Executive Chair and Chief Executive Officer. As stated in this policy, the responsibilities include the following: • Issue the organization’s EHS Policy, setting the example for FOX’s culture • Assume overall responsibility for implementing the EHS Policy at all FOX facilities • Assess information provided during periodic EHS management reviews, and direct actions to continually improve the EHS management program and reduce risk in the workplace. 
The day-to-day management of environmental issues is overseen by our President of Operations and Distribution and implemented by our dedicated Environmental, Health and Safety team.
Additionally, under EHS, the FOX Global Security team oversees the Company’s security and emergency response efforts. The team proactively monitors, reports and responds to potential and actual threats to people, physical assets and property, as well as productions and events, using a number of tools including advanced technology, active training programs, risk assessment and management processes.

ALBERT FOX assisted with the development of a voluntary studio sustainability standard in partnership with albert, a UK-based organization that supports the global film and TV industry to reduce the environmental impacts of production and to create content that supports a vision for a sustainable future. The standard will allow studios to focus and pinpoint key areas within their facility where they can make improvements to reduce their environmental impact over six key areas: Climate, Circularity, Nature, People, Management and Data.
GREEN SPORTS ALLIANCE SUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENTS This year, FOX collaborated with the Green Sports Alliance (GSA) to better understand our impacts on remote productions through comprehensive sustainability assessments. Our assessments took place at two NASCAR productions in Phoenix and Kansas City and gave insight into current impacts, gaps and opportunities through material waste, energy, emissions and employee engagement. As FOX Sports continues to broadcast elite sports productions across the world, it is vital to understand baseline environmental performance within its control of influence and develop an action plan that will increase operating efficiencies, grow brand value, mitigate risk and engage internal and external stakeholders. We will continue to explore and engage our remote productions to position our teams as a leader in sports broadcasting and across the green sports movement.
ENVIRONMENTAL EFFORTS WITH MLB GREEN This MLB Season, FOX engaged with MLB Green on various environmental initiatives at several events including the All-Star Game, Field of Dreams, Postseason Playoffs and the World Series. Efforts included distributing reusable aluminum PATH water bottles, setting up water refill stations, donating leftover food, utilizing recycle bins and purchasing offsets. We look forward to continuing our relationship with MLB Green into the next MLB Season and Postseason.

OVERSIGHT The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors has responsibility for the content and operation of FOX’s business ethics and compliance program, including anti-bribery and corruption programs as well as any legal or regulatory matter that could have significant impact on FOX’s financial statements. The Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer reports to senior management and to the Audit Committee about existing compliance programs and proposed new initiatives. The Company has adopted several operational compliance policies and programs, including an Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy, an Insider Trading and Confidentiality Policy, a Political Activities Policy, and a Global Sanctions, Anti-Boycott and Import/Export Policy.
FOX’s Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer leads the Company’s ethics and compliance program and assists the Board of Directors in fulfilling its oversight duties concerning compliance with applicable laws, regulations and accounting standards, and the dissemination of true and accurate information. On behalf of senior management, the Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer ensures processes are fully embedded in the business.
The Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer works with liaisons in each business unit to coordinate compliance policies and controls and related ongoing risk assessments.
DYNAMIC RISK ASSESSMENTS. 
We undertake various risk assessments as part of our efforts to ensure compliance with our Standards of Business Conduct and other compliance policies. These include: • All compliance-sensitive vendors are identified and escalated to the Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer for risk assessment and review before being approved. We utilize both subjective assessments and screening of all vendors embedded in the intake process for our Accounts Payable/Vendor Management system.
• Through periodic compliance risk assessments, FOX identifies and assesses operations that present the greatest compliance risk and prioritizes resources to address those risk areas.
• Financial transactions involving onboarding of government-related vendors must be reviewed and approved by, among others, the Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer.
• The FOX Corporate Audit group periodically reviews the completeness and reliability of this practice. In addition, business units that conduct operations in jurisdictions with known levels of perceived corruption, or in other situations where the potential for corruption may present itself, meet prospectively with our Compliance team to assess potential risks and formulate risk reduction and remediation strategies.
THIRD PARTIES We require that consultants, agents and other third parties acting on behalf of FOX adhere to the principles contained in our Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy. We ensure that all payments to third parties are recorded accurately and documented appropriately.
TRAINING All FOX employees must read our Standards of Business Conduct and Global Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy and acknowledge that they have done so. There is also periodic training about our Standards of Business Conduct. All new employees are required to complete an online training module focused on anti-bribery and anti-corruption as part of the onboarding process, and existing employees are also required to complete this training periodically.

REPORTING CONCERNS The Standards of Business Conduct and Employee Handbook both include information about how ethics concerns can be raised. Employees can approach a manager in Human Resources or an attorney in the Legal Department, in any FOX business unit.
The Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer and designated compliance or legal liaison in each respective business unit are also available to serve as additional resources.
Any stakeholder (including employees, suppliers, customers and other third parties) can also use FOX’s independently managed Alertline. Alertline supports anonymous reporting of concerns either through a dedicated, domestic/international toll-free telephone number available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, or through a secure website.
Translation services are available through Alertline. Reports are treated confidentially. Alertline (both online and telephonic) is maintained by a third-party provider. The system generates an auditable log of all concerns that are received through that system. A summary of the complaint is distributed by the system to senior members of the Audit, Legal and HR teams, as well as the Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer, who decide what further action may be necessary.
On a quarterly basis, the Senior Vice President of Corporate Audit reports on whistleblower complaints to FOX senior management and to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.
The Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer also plays a role in the resolution of complaints, where warranted. In addition, there may be certain circumstances when a colleague or anyone with an ethics or compliance concern believes that they cannot communicate that concern through regular channels. In such a situation, that person may communicate directly with the Lead Independent Director of FOX’s Board, by addressing a letter to the attention of Lead Independent Director, Fox Corporation, 1211 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10036.
INTEGRITY IN SPORTS BETTING FOX Sports is synonymous with the best live sports events in the country. The Company also operates a licensed sports-betting marketing affiliate site and has other relationships with and involving the licensed U.S. sports-betting industry. For all those reasons, ensuring the integrity of sporting events and wagering, and avoiding even the appearance of impropriety, are critical. At all times, gaming and broadcast integrity are at the forefront. FOX is committed to expanding sports fans’ experience responsibly and ethically.
At FOX, we never exploit our positions for personal gain in gaming, broadcasting, or otherwise. Our Standards of Business Conduct demonstrate our fidelity to our focus on acting ethically and refraining from self-dealing.
• As one of the world’s leading sports broadcasters, FOX personnel may learn information about sporting events and athletes before it becomes known to the public. We do not share non-public information except as part of our journalistic responsibilities. We never use it for personal gain. For example, members of the production team on FOX’s broadcast of an NFL football game might learn before the game begins that one team’s starting quarterback suffered a serious injury while warming up—information not yet known to the general public. Any FOX personnel learning of this information would be prohibited from betting on the game and would also be prohibited from sharing the information with friends, family members or acquaintances before it becomes known to the general public. Similarly, if the injured football player was a member of the USFL, that player’s teammates would be barred from sharing the information with third parties.
• FOX personnel may not wager with or through a FOX-controlled or affiliated sportsbook or marketing affiliate. FOX currently does not own majority interest in or control any sportsbook; however, FOX’s Outkick Media LLC, for example, is a licensed sports-betting marketing affiliate. FOX personnel may not open any account or place any wager through Outkick or any other marketing affiliate or sportsbook in which FOX may acquire a majority interest or control in the future.
• Not only are FOX employees required to refrain from improperly benefiting from their position or access, they must also guard against family, household members and others receiving improper betting advantages.
• We do not promote unlawful or unlicensed betting. FOX prohibits its personnel from endorsing, promoting or otherwise advancing unlawful or unlicensed sports betting or gambling.
• At FOX, we always uphold the integrity of sporting events or sports betting that FOX broadcasts or promotes. FOX’s unique position as a leading sports broadcaster, coupled with its relationship to the sports betting industry, necessitates extra care to avoid even the appearance of impropriety in this area. We avoid taking any step that might be viewed as creating that perception and promptly report any incident or event that might do so.
FOX employees are encouraged to seek clarification on the use of non-public information from the Legal Department, the Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer and the Chief Legal and Policy Officer.

POLITICAL INVOLVEMENT In 2022, FOX amended the Political Activities Policy to provide for Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee oversight of the Company’s political activities and the publication of the annual Political Activities Report, as well as to include an affirmation that fees paid to industry trade organizations are for membership dues and not earmarked for indirect grassroots lobbying.
FOX’s Political Activities Policy is designed to ensure that all FOX employees, officers and directors comply with all laws and regulations that apply to political activities due to employment or association with FOX. The Report focuses on six areas of political activity: • providing gifts or other items of value to public officials; • lobbying lawmakers and government officials on policies that are important to FOX; • making corporate or personal political contributions; • running for political office; • supporting the FOX Political Action Committee (FOXPAC); and • trade association membership.
The FOX Political Activities Report also outlines the Company’s engagement efforts in six areas of corporate political activity in 2021: • the amounts and recipients of contributions made by the FOX Political Action Committee; • the amounts and recipients of corporate political contributions to state and local candidates; • total federal lobbying expenses; • specific policy issues on which the FOX Government Relations office advocated; • the names of executives and outside consulting firms that performed lobbying activities for us; and • our trade association memberships and certain non-profit organization contributions.
EDITORIAL GUIDELINES AND BROADCAST STANDARDS The First Amendment and the fundamental values it embodies help define who we are and what we do. As an important source of news, information, analysis and media, we play a leading role in the marketplace of ideas. Our flagship news properties are some of the most influential in history, and we respect the significant responsibility that comes with being a steward of the people’s right to know. The core values of our entire business—free press, free speech and free expression—reflect our commitment to the people’s right to know, to be informed and to participate in the marketplace of ideas. FOX’s Standards of Business Conduct, Employee Handbook and Standards & Practices Program Standards Manual confirm our position and expectations regarding editorial independence and broadcast standards. Employees are required to read the policies and acknowledge that they have done so.
FOX is committed to: • Accuracy and editorial independence: Our news organizations carefully vet sources and check facts, and we maintain strict separation between revenue sources and our news and opinion content.
• Freedom of speech and the press: We zealously guard and defend our journalists in their search for the truth. Indeed, we believe so strongly in these core values that we have often come to the defense of our competitors, recognizing that a free press benefits all of us and requires the support of each and every one of us.
• Protection of the newsgathering process: FOX protects the integrity of the entire newsgathering and editorial process. We safeguard the confidentiality of information, communications and sources that our journalists acquire in the course of their reporting.
We defend against external intrusion into the editorial or thought processes of our newsroom personnel, including the disclosure of drafts, edits or confidential newsroom discussions about which stories merit publication.
• Journalistic independence: FOX staunchly supports the editorial judgments of our reporters and will resist the attempts of litigants, regulators or other third parties to infringe on them.
• Respecting of cultural rights and diversity: Various FOX programming and advertising guidelines outline our expectations regarding sensitivity to and respect for ethnic, religious, sexual and other areas of social concern.
• Equal access to content and services: FOX networks are widely distributed (including cable, satellite and streaming), ensuring that anyone can easily gain access to our content. FOX News and FOX Business are available in approximately 80 million U.S. households, and the FOX Network covers approximately 99.9% of U.S. television households. To ensure access for people with disabilities, FOX provides closed captioning, video description and visual access to emergency information.
• Promoting responsible decision making by appropriate audiences: We provide V-Chip ratings and advisories, where applicable, on all entertainment programming and promotions longer than ten seconds (excluding news and live sports), allowing parents to block programs they do not want children to watch. We are also beginning to provide ratings for programming that appear on our recently-acquired streaming service Tubi, which also provides parental controls to block programs.

42 • Protecting intellectual property: We engage in fair competition, protect our intellectual property and respect the intellectual property and proprietary information of others. We do not seek or accept the confidential information of competitors or business partners to gain an improper commercial advantage. We do not download or use copyrighted materials— such as pictures, films or videos, music, software or source code—without a proper license.
In November 2019, FOX News became a partner in the Protect Press Freedom campaign launched by the Committee to Protect Journalists to create public awareness about threats to press freedom. Other members of the campaign include CNN, The New York Times, Reuters, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post.
In addition, for many years, FOX News and FOX Television Stations have supported the Media Law Resources Center (MLRC), founded in 1980 by leading American publishers and broadcasters to assist in defending and protecting free press rights under the First Amendment. Today, MLRC is supported by more than 115 members, including leading publishers, broadcasters and cable programmers, as well as internet operations, media and professional trade associations, and media insurance professionals in the U.S. and around the world.
Fox Corporation’s Standards & Practices Program group reviews advertising and on-air promotional material to confirm that it complies with regulatory and network guidelines and is placed within appropriate programming. Our business units maintain portals through which viewers can provide feedback regarding the content of programming, advertising and on-air promotional materials. The feedback portals relating to our sports and entertainment programming are available at FOX and FOX Sports, and we will be implementing feedback portals at FOX News Channel and FOX Business in the future. The Standards & Practices Program group maintains records of all complaints received through these portals as well as feedback passed to the network via local stations. We use viewer feedback to review our Standards & Practices judgments with regard to content and scheduling.
FOX also participates in many industry initiatives and organizations to promote media ethics, including:
Entertainment Industries Council: FOX regularly hosts events and supports initiatives that further the Council’s mission to encourage the entertainment industry to more effectively address and accurately depict major health and social issues.
TV Parental Guidelines Monitoring Board: FOX is an active member of this organization, which is “responsible for ensuring there is as much uniformity and consistency in applying the Parental Guidelines as possible.”
ADVERTISING ETHICS The marketplace of ideas is where FOX and its brands thrive. Our success rests on the principles of free expression, free inquiry and freedom of choice. That also holds true for our participation in the business world generally, where we vigorously protect our reputation for honesty, transparency and fair competition.
Our credibility lies at the core of our success, from the content we create to the advertising that appears on our networks. Our networks sell commercial announcement time for the advertising of goods and services and for institutional advertising. We recognize that advertising must be truthful, appropriate, and comply with all Federal Communications Commission, Federal Trade Commission and legal requirements.
The FOX Network’s Advertiser Guidelines provide a comprehensive set of standards covering, among other things, stereotyping and other community sensibilities, violence and anti-social behavior and requirements for product claims to be fully substantiated.
The Advertiser Guidelines also mandate that every commercial airing on the FOX Network must be evaluated and approved in advance by FOX’s Broadcast Standards Department, which reserves the right, at any time, to withdraw approval of a commercial spot.
FOX’s Standards & Practices Program group reviews advertising and on-air promotional material to confirm it complies with regulatory and network guidelines.

FOX’s Privacy Policies also provide various choices for consumers to access and control their personal information, including the ability to access and delete their personal information.
FOX also notifies users of changes to its Privacy Policies, including informing users that they should look at the Effective Date of the applicable policy to see when it was last revised and that any changes will become effective when a revised policy is posted.

DATA PRIVACY PROGRAM. 
FOX has a dedicated Privacy Department, headed by two Co-Chief Privacy Officers who share oversight and responsibility over the enterprise’s privacy program.
The Privacy Department works closely with FOX’s Information Security Department and Chief Information Security Officer to ensure a coordinated and layered approach to protecting user data. FOX engages employees on privacy-related risk, compliance and information protection procedures through regular training. FOX also participates in data privacy industry organizations including as a corporate member of the International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP).
FOX’s Co-Chief Privacy Officers are experts in their field and have spoken on privacy panels at industry conferences including the IAPP, the American Bar Association Forum on Communications Law, the Privacy + Security Forum and the UCLA Ziffren Institute for Media, Entertainment, Technology & Sports Law’s Privacy and Access Series.
DATA SECURITY. 
FOX has a dedicated Information Security department headed by its Chief Information Security Officer. FOX uses the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Framework in assessing the overall maturity of its cybersecurity program, including how the program assesses and mitigates risks.
An independent third-party auditing firm annually assesses our adherence to the NIST Framework and our program maturity against industry benchmarks. The Chief Information Security Officer updates the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors quarterly on our cybersecurity program and on progress against maturity improvement areas.
FOX also regularly employs internal and external technical penetration testing and audit procedures against our environments including those systems, products and practices collecting or storing confidential business and personal information—including user data—in accordance with FOX’s security policies. These tests are routinely performed at the application, infrastructure and network level by leading third-party assessment firms.
FOX conducts annual mandatory company-wide cybersecurity compliance training, fosters awareness during Cybersecurity Awareness Month, releases monthly cybersecurity training videos and conducts regular targeted employee training. FOX also regularly conducts executive tabletop exercises involving detailed and topical cybersecurity scenarios.
FOX TECHNOLOGY CENTER Built for the Future. 
The FOX Technology Center (FTC), a critical cornerstone of FOX’s investment in next-generation broadcast technology, became operational in 2021. Built from the ground up in Tempe, Arizona, the state-of-the-art complex provides essential technical foundations for the Company’s digital streaming and content distribution capabilities.
The 125,000 square foot complex powers all of FOX’s marquee broadcast events including the MLB World Series, NCAA football and basketball, FIFA Men's and FIFA Women's World Cups, NFL season and NFC Championships, midterm elections and Super Bowl LVII.
Since its inception, the FTC team has already delivered 6,000 out of 6,500 live sports and entertainment events broadcast by FOX and over 200,000 media assets. It delivers thousands of hours of content in high definition, 4K and 8K to any device or platform and supports over 1,000 distribution partners nationwide and over 200 FOX-affiliated stations. Additionally, the FTC powers the Company’s FOX Weather Channel.
The FTC also incorporates a range of investments and partnerships in key areas, including integrated cloud computing, software engineering, artificial intelligence, enhanced video processing and delivery standards such as ATSC 3.05 and 5G.
Moreover, FTC has a data and media center that performs various data and information processing tasks, such as asset ingestion, metadata processing, content management, storage, transformation and distribution. We also employ high-tech personnel and systems responsible for cybersecurity.
The FTC is one of the media industry’s most advanced data architectures, and we strive to support individual and collective innovation for all our tech team members across the country and around the world.
