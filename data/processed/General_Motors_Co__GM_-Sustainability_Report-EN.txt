Water is critical to automobile production and to building occupants for drinking water and hygiene. Local facility knowledge provides information on water supply impacts for current operations, and we engage in the use of WRI Aqueduct for future forecasting. Risks in current operations are mitigated with alternate supply, working with local utilities, conservation or process water reuse. GM engages with over 300 suppliers through CDP Water Supply Chain and other organizations like AIAG. Company goals were set to continuously improve and reduce intensity from 2010 to 2035 by 35%. Water is integrated into our business plan, and each facility has a target for year-over-year reductions.

GRI 303: WATER AND EFFLUENTS (CONT.) 303-2 Management of water discharge-related impacts General Motors maintains an environmental performance criteria document on water pollution control (EPC-003). Within this document, minimum concentration-based performance requirements are defined for wastewater discharge to surface water and for wastewater discharges to external wastewater systems. Where local permit limits are more stringent, those supersede the GM requirements. Where no permit limit is provided, the performance requirements are used.
303-3 Water withdrawal GM measures and monitors 100% of our major facilities’ water withdrawals by source using either invoices or meter data on a monthly basis. It is tracked in a global utility database by source, and the data is verified by an independent third party annually. Some small facilities (offices) have water service included in their lease rate, and we do not track the water withdrawal. Our estimate is that this represents less than 1% of our water withdrawal by source, so we measure and monitor 99% of water withdrawal by source.
GM identifies water stress using WRI Aqueduct model and internal company knowledge. GM measures and monitors 100% of our water withdrawals by source from water-stressed areas, using either invoices or meter data on a monthly basis. It is tracked in a global utility database by source, and the data is verified by an independent third party annually.
See also: Data Center 303-4 Water discharge GM sites must have a system in place to identify wastewater generated and discharged by current activities at the site, and as these activities change in the future, sites should also identify any additional potentially contaminated flows from on-site sources.
See also: Data Center 303-5 Water consumption GM calculates water consumption based on water withdrawal times, an engineering calculation for evaporation of 30%. Using the formula withdrawal minus discharge provides close to zero consumption due to groundwater infiltration at plant sites. GM experiences water stress at three sites in Mexico and two sites in China. We have mitigated the risk by conservation, recycling or reusing wastewater in the manufacturing process. Additionally, at one site in China, the government has provided a backup source of water to mitigate water stress risk. See also: Data Center.

Governance. 
Disclose the organization’s governance around climate-related risks and opportunities.
a) Describe the board’s oversight of climaterelated risks and opportunities.
The General Motors Board of Directors is committed to overseeing the company’s integration of environmental, social and governance (ESG) principles throughout the enterprise, and oversees the company’s ESG risks, priorities and opportunities.
The Board is committed to sound corporate governance policies and practices that are designed and routinely assessed to enable GM to operate our business responsibly, with integrity, and to position GM to compete more effectively, sustain our success and build long-term shareholder value. The Board works with management to integrate ESG principles into the company’s business strategy. This includes agenda items and discussions related to ESG topics at Board and committee meetings.
Expertise related to environmental, social and/or governance-related issues, including climate, are among the qualifications considered prior to recommending an incumbent, replacement or additional director to the Board.
The Board discharges its risk oversight responsibilities, in part, through delegation to its committees. The Board has six standing committees: Audit; Executive; Executive Compensation; Finance; Governance and Corporate Responsibility; and Risk and Cybersecurity. All standing committees of the Board, other than the Executive Committee, are composed entirely of independent directors. As a full Board, and through these committees, the Board is committed to overseeing the company’s integration of ESG principles throughout GM’s business and managing the related risks and opportunities.
Each committee has a written charter setting forth its purpose, authority and duties. Overall, the committees enhance the Board’s oversight of areas that are critical to GM’s corporate responsibility and sustainability efforts, including transparent and reliable financial reporting; risk identification and mitigation (including climate change and other ESG issues); ethics and compliance; product and workplace safety; supply chain and human rights; pay-for-performance; data security; diversity, equity and inclusion; Board and management succession planning; consideration of shareholder proposals; and political and lobbying priorities and expenditures.
In 2021, each Board committee further incorporated ESG responsibilities into their charters in recognition that ESG risks are all-encompassing. The following committees have climate-related responsibilities:
Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee (GCRC)
The GCRC oversees the Company’s development of ESG initiatives, strategies, policies and practices related to matters of sustainability and corporate responsibility that have a material impact on the company. The GCRC is responsible for tracking GM’s ESG scorecard and conducts annual reviews of ESG reporting standards, lobbying activities, corporate philanthropy and human rights (including responsible sourcing practices and policies). In addition, the GCRC approves the company’s annual Sustainability Report and associated disclosures, including TCFD.
Risk and Cybersecurity Committee (RCC)
The committee oversees risks related to the company’s key strategic, enterprise and cybersecurity risks, including climate change, workplace and product safety and privacy.
The RCC considers ESG-related risks as part of the company’s enterprise risk profile. This includes, but is not limited to, transitions associated with.

The Audit Committee (AC)
In addition to its oversight of the quality, integrity and compliance of GM’s financial statements, the AC began reviewing the process and control procedures for ESG disclosures in 2021. In 2022, the committee will begin approving the company’s annual Sustainability Report and TCFD response prior to publication.
Executive Compensation Committee (ECC)
Starting in 2022, the ECC will annually: • Evaluate whether the company’s ESG and sustainability goals and milestones are effectively integrated into the compensation programs.
• Review compensation plans for executives to confirm alignment to GM’s sustainability risks and opportunities.
• Consider shareholder feedback relative to the alignment of GM’s sustainability goals with respect to the annual shareholder say-on-pay vote.
Please see our CDP Climate Change 2021 response (C1.1, C1.1a, C1.1b) as well as GM’s 2022 Proxy Statement, beginning on page 6, for further discussion of Board oversight on ESG measures.
The company’s risk governance is facilitated through a top-down and bottom-up structure, with the tone established at the top by the Board Chair and CEO, who is also our chief risk officer, and other members of management, specifically the Senior Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT also utilizes our Risk Advisory Council, an executive-level body with delegates from each business unit, to discuss and monitor the most significant enterprise and emerging risks in a cross-functional setting. They are tasked with championing risk management practices and integrating them into their functional or regional business units.
Sustainability Office (SO)
Management of climate-related risks and opportunities ultimately resides with the CEO, who leads our SLT. This group includes the executive vice president of global manufacturing to whom our chief sustainability officer (CSO) reports. The group is responsible for ensuring climate-related considerations are incorporated into the company’s overall business strategy and that climate-related risks are considered in GM’s enterprise risk management framework and decision-making processes. The CSO chairs the SO and works cross-functionally to integrate sustainability across the enterprise.
Examples of areas overseen by the SO: • Tracks and monitors execution of public commitments made by the company related to sustainability goals such as carbon neutrality and approved Science Based Target initiatives (SBTi).
• Works with the enterprise to ensure responsible sourcing and consumption of materials and production of vehicles.
• Coordinates with the business on the strategic design and implementation of our electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure.

Strategy. 
Disclose the actual and potential impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organization’s businesses, strategy and financial planning.
We recognize that our impact as a business extends to the opportunity to help people thrive in a better, more sustainable world. That is why we are working toward a zero-emissions future, which will require actions beyond just accelerating EV adoption. We plan to become carbon neutral in our global products and operations by 2040 and eliminate tailpipe emissions from new light-duty vehicles by 2035. We continue working toward our target of sourcing 100% renewable energy to power our U.S. operations by 2025 and our global operations by 2035.
In 2021, GM partnered with a third-party consultant to begin a twoyear journey to better define the company’s climate-related risks and opportunities. The focus is to identify climate-related risks, exposure, potential impacts and key performance indicators. In particular, this journey will include climate change scenarios and business alignment with various climate-related scenarios. Progress on this exercise will be shared in our 2022 TCFD disclosure.
We categorize risks as physical and transition risks. Transition risks result from the global transition to a low-carbon and climate-resilient economy, while physical risks result from extreme weather events and increasing average global mean temperatures. Transition risk related to technology results from availability of technology to address climate impacts.
To the right we have identified key climate-related risks and opportunities with potential impact to our business over short-, medium- and long-term time horizons.

PHYSICAL RISKS. 
Risk: Increased storms and droughts creating production disruptions. 
Increased intensity, frequency or duration of storms, droughts or other severe weather events that may result from climate change could disrupt our production and the production, logistics, cost and procurement of products from our suppliers and timely delivery of vehicles to customers, and could negatively impact working conditions at our plants and those of our suppliers. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
GRI Index SASB Response TCFD Response UN SDGs UNGC Data Center Assurance Statements 2021 SUSTAINABILITY SUPPLEMENT 23


TCFD Response. 
Approach. 
We manage these risks based on the location of our operations around the world and the risk profile for a particular region. As an example, increases in the frequency of drought conditions can depress water availability for production in water-stressed areas. GM has production facilities in Mexico, an area hard hit by drought in recent years, and there is a risk that increases in the frequency of such events could disrupt production due to lack of water availability.
GM has integrated water management into our annual business planning process and has set a target to reduce the water intensity of our operations 35% by 2035 compared to a 2010 baseline. We also have signed the CEO Water Mandate—a UN Global Compact Initiative—joining other global business leaders to address key challenges around water security and further aligning the UN Sustainable Development Goals. We also are a long-term reporter to CDP Water and have made the “A” list for three consecutive years.
Water consumption is managed on a local basis, with each facility working toward its own targets for year-over-year improvement. Innovative approaches have allowed facilities to continue production without disruptions, even in water-stressed areas. At our San Luis Potosí assembly plant in Mexico, GM uses a zero liquid discharge system to minimize the reliance on well water. The system purifies and transforms wastewater into reusable water for the facility’s paint and machining processes, as well as for landscape irrigation.
See our CDP Climate Change 2021 (2.2a, 2.3a) for more detail, and learn more about our management of water resources and water stress regions in our CDP Water report.
b) Describe the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organization’s businesses, strategy and financial planning. (cont.)
TRANSITION RISKS Risk: Reduced availability of raw materials potentially impacting costs and scheduling of vehicle production. 
We purchase a wide variety of raw materials, parts, supplies, energy, freight, transportation and other services from numerous suppliers across the globe to manufacture our products. The raw materials primarily include steel, aluminum, resins, copper, lead and precious metals.
Reduced availability of raw materials can lead to increases in prices for commodities, raw materials or other inputs that we and our suppliers use in manufacturing products, systems, components and parts. In addition, any increase in the cost of critical materials for our EV propulsion systems, including lithium, nickel, cobalt and certain rare earth metals, could lead to higher production costs for our EVs and could impede our ability to successfully deliver on our EV strategy.
Further, increasing global demand for, and uncertain supply of, such materials could disrupt our suppliers’ ability to obtain such materials in a timely manner and/or could lead to increased costs. Geopolitical risk, fluctuations in supply and demand, any weakening of the U.S. dollar and other economic and political factors may continue to create pricing pressure for commodities, raw materials and other inputs.
Approach. 
In every region in which we operate, local sourcing as a percentage of regional spend, which ranges from 73% in South America and other international regions to 92% in North America and 96% in China, helps us to mitigate certain supply chain risks. Our transition to EVs includes building a resilient, scalable and more sustainable North.

Please see our CDP Climate Change 2021 (C2.2a) for more detail.
Risk: Lack of EV charging infrastructure potentially impacting consumer adoption. 
Consumer adoption of EVs will be critical to the success of our strategy. This could be impacted by numerous factors, including the proliferation of charging infrastructure (in particular public charging stations). Also, the failure by governments and other third parties to make the investments necessary for infrastructure improvements, such as greater availability of cleaner energy grids and EV charging stations, or to provide economic incentives promoting EVs, could impact consumer adoption as well.
Approach. 
To support mass market adoption of EVs, we are working to ensure that our customers will have access to comprehensive charging solutions. For personal vehicles, this means strategically addressing charging needs at residences, the workplace and in public locations. For fleet vehicles, this means turnkey charging solutions and fleet and facility energy management services.

This could change our manufacturing processes or product portfolio Climate change regulations at the federal, state or local level or in international jurisdictions could require further limits to emissions associated with customer use of products sold, or make it necessary for us to undertake other activities that may require us to incur additional expense.
Part of our strategy to address these risks includes our transition to EVs, which is dependent upon customer acceptance, and could result in reduced demand for, and therefore profits from, our internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, which we plan to use to fund our growth strategy.
Approach. 
We are working closely with governments worldwide to implement complementary policies to bolster consumer education and incentives, infrastructure, manufacturing, clean power, and research and development investments that are critical to the success of our allelectric vision and our broader climate goals.
To accomplish these advocacy objectives, GM is committed to working globally with a broad set of key partners, industry associations, coalitions and governmental policymakers at the national, state/ provincial and local levels.

b) Describe the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organization’s businesses, strategy and financial planning. (cont.)
Risk: Competition from peers in transition to EVs potentially impacting company sales and market share. 
Our EV strategy is dependent on our ability to: deliver a broad portfolio of high-quality EVs that are competitive and meet consumer demands; reduce the costs associated with manufacturing EVs, particularly with respect to batteries; increase vehicle range and the energy density of our batteries; license and monetize our proprietary platforms and related innovations; successfully invest in new technologies relative to our peers; develop new software and services; and leverage our scale, manufacturing capabilities and synergies with existing ICE vehicles.
Approach. 
Continuous innovation and advanced technology development are key to keeping up with changing consumer behavior. One way GM achieves this is through our global network of R&D labs around the world, as well as through active collaboration with academia, suppliers and startups to develop new technologies, such as our electrification platform.
GM is committed to developing a broad set of EVs for every lifestyle and price point. This will be enabled by our proprietary Ultium Platform—a combined EV architecture and propulsion system that enables EVs at scale. This platform can power transportation from family vehicles to luxury vehicles, work trucks and high-performance vehicles. As a result, GM will be positioned to compete for nearly every customer type and preference in the market.
Ultium-based EVs will be powered by rectangular, pouch-style battery cells that are simple, lightweight and space-efficient. Our ability to stack the long pouch cells vertically or horizontally is unique in the industry and allows for a flat cabin floor and more interior room than.

b) Describe the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organization’s businesses, strategy and financial planning. (cont.)
Opportunity: Increased capital availability due to investor interest in decarbonization of the transportation sector. 
Approach. 
In the capital markets, strong ESG performance could, in some cases, position GM shares to be included on certain securities indexes, as well as leading to more favorable debt pricing.
Our development of autonomous vehicles (AV) provides an example of increased capital availability due to investor interest and the potential for new revenue opportunities. Cruise, our global segment responsible for the development and commercialization of AV technology, has attracted funding from financial and strategic investors, including Honda, Microsoft and Walmart. This capital infusion, combined with our funding and collaboration, is enabling Cruise and GM to accelerate their efforts to commercialize self-driving vehicles. Learn more in the Advancing Transformative Technologies section.
In addition, AVs—particularly those that are passenger cars—could significantly affect the country’s ability to cut GHG emissions and move toward a carbon-free economy. Existing studies suggest that three main factors will determine whether putting more AVs on the road increases or decreases tailpipe carbon emissions: effect on the total vehicle-miles traveled in the United States; impacts on congestion; and AV fuel efficiency and fossil fuel consumption. As such, AVs must be assessed not only for their safety but also for their effect on carbon emissions levels.
Every Cruise AV test vehicle is also an EV that is derived from the Chevrolet Bolt EV. Introducing these technologies in tandem accomplishes multiple goals, including increasing acceptance of EVs and encouraging buildout of EV charging infrastructure.

Opportunity: Shift in consumer preferences toward EVs creating new sales and new customer opportunities. 
Approach. 
In 2021, we accelerated our plan to transition to an all-electric future by announcing an increase in our EV and AV development investment target from $20 billion to $35 billion within the period of 2020 through 2025.
We also announced plans to introduce more than 30 EVs globally by the end of 2025, with more than two-thirds of these available in North America. These introductions, along with additional EVs being planned, will enable EV sales to represent 40% to 50% of annual U.S. automotive sales volume by 2030, which is aligned with the current administration’s target of 50% electric vehicle sales share in 2030. To reach this upper range, we will continue to work with federal, state and local governments to implement supportive policies that will move the United States closer to meeting the carbon neutrality goals of the Paris Agreement.
In China, the world’s largest EV market, we will accelerate electrification through a plan in which 40% of new vehicles introduced through the end of 2025 will be EVs. This will build on our current market momentum in China.
Based on our planned cadence of EV introductions, GM will have more than 1 million units of EV capacity in North America by the end of 2025. Additionally, GM will build up more than 1 million units in China over the same time frame. Our EV portfolio is planned to be among the broadest in the industry, with entries from affordable, high-volume market segments to top-of-the-line models and everything in between.
Opportunity: Technological advances (e.g., battery and manufacturing efficiency) enabling resource and cost savings. 
Approach. 
Ultium represents a milestone achievement in electrification, with battery pack costs nearly 40% lower compared to the previous generation, and we expect the second generation Ultium packs will cost nearly 60% less than the batteries used today.1 We are committed to continuous improvement in manufacturing, materials and packaging efficiencies, high-energy cell design and increased vertical integration with local production that will deliver greater energy density at a lower cost.
Opportunity: Leadership in electrification and fuel cell innovation leading to new sales and market opportunities. 
Our business growth model is predicated on leveraging leading positions in electrification, hydrogen fuel cell, autonomy and connected vehicles—positions that are transforming GM from automaker to platform innovator.
The unique modularity and flexibility of the Ultium platform opens opportunities beyond our own vehicles. Ultium, together with our Hydrotec fuel cell platform, gives GM the potential to transform planes, trains, automobiles and boats into all-electric products. In 2021, GM made the following moves to extend zero emissions beyond automotive vehicles: • GM and Wabtec Corporation entered into a nonbinding memorandum of understanding to leverage our Ultium battery and HYDROTEC fuel cell technologies for Wabtec locomotives.

Managing Climate Change Risk. 
Disclose how the organization identifies, assesses and manages climate-related risks.
During 2021, we took steps to develop and refine our processes for identifying and evaluating climate-related risks. In collaboration with a third-party consultant, our corporate sustainability team convened and hosted a series of workshops with leaders from across key functions of the business, including public policy, GHG emissions experts, portfolio planning, strategic risk management, supply chain, legal and others. Through these workshops, we developed and validated an initial risk identification process as well as helped to ensure a strong and consistent understanding of the process for analyzing climate-related risks for TCFD purposes.
Over the course of multiple days and sessions, we discussed dozens of potential risks and opportunities to determine those most applicable to our business, and then to qualitatively prioritize them. This identification and prioritization exercise was performed by business experts and leaders based on the experience and expertise of each. The results were further validated by sharing and discussing with the broader Office of Sustainability governance body, which includes senior leaders working on sustainability across the business.
Over the course of 2022, we will continue refining our risk identification process and assessing our exposure to these risks by partnering with a respected third party to employ their climate risk modeling platform. We will quantitatively evaluate both physical and transition risks under at least two to three different climate change scenarios. We will be paying careful attention to the sensitivity of the results to different assumptions and parameters. We also will be exploring how to further integrate the results from this assessment into strategic decision-making, as well as opportunities to internalize some of these processes and tools to enable us to efficiently conduct these assessments in the future.
Please see our CDP Climate Change 2021 response (C2.2, C2.2a, C2.3a) for more details.
GM approaches relevant climate-related risks on a risk-by-risk basis. The physical and transition risks identified earlier in this document are relevant to different parts of the business. For example, the risk of increased flooding and extreme weather events impacting the production, logistics and procurement of products from suppliers is managed by our GPSC organization. Securing consistent, resilient and sustainable supply chains for key materials is a strategic priority for GPSC. The organization maintains a “command center” that monitors real-time conditions and data from multiple sources to identify such events around the world and map them to our suppliers. In the event of an anticipated or actual disruption, alerts are quickly sent to the relevant teams internally, and contingency plans are created and implemented.
Raw material cost and supply variability are monitored closely by purchasing teams and senior leaders from multiple parts of the business. GM is prioritizing the development of a resilient and sustainable supply chain of raw materials to manufacture our battery chemistry, which requires cobalt, battery-grade nickel and lithium as well as other minerals. We are proactively and aggressively pursuing responsibly sourced materials at strategic tiers of the supply chain and exploring where investment and partnerships can yield benefits and untapped value that lowers costs of advanced technologies. Recently, we have advanced several initiatives in North America related to supplies of silicon carbide device solutions, rare earth minerals, lithium and cathode active material.

As another example, to address the potential consumer demand risk associated with EV charging infrastructure, GM is partnering with EVgo to build out one of the nation’s largest EV charging networks. Learn more about our EV infrastructure initiatives in the Reducing Carbon Emissions section of our Sustainability Report.
Please see our CDP Climate Change 2021 response (C1.2a, C2.2, C2.3a) for more details.
As part of our comprehensive climate change strategy, we identify and monitor climate-related risks on a regular basis across our business. The need for this constant process reflects the volatility of risk factors and dynamics that can quickly change scenarios. By institutionalizing climate change risks as part of our enterprise risk management function, we believe GM is better positioned to anticipate, detect and, ultimately, plan around these changes.
The Role of the Board and Senior Management. 
The Board has the overall responsibility for risk oversight, with a focus on the most significant risks facing the company, including climate change. While GM does not follow the precautionary approach, the company does have a comprehensive risk management plan in place. The Board implements its risk oversight function both as a whole and through delegation to Board Committees. Each of the Board Committees is responsible for oversight of risk management practices for categories of risks relevant to its functions, with the GCRC being responsible for risks related to the sustainability of our operations and products.
The process and terminology in place for assessing relative significance of all identified risks, including climate-related risks such as increased and more stringent GHG emission regulations, is as follows: • Risks and opportunities are assessed based on probability of occurrence and impact to our financials, strategy and/or reputation.
• All enterprise risks have approved mitigation plans and are reviewed regularly by the SLT and the Board.
• Each SLT member is involved in an annual risk assessment of their business unit to determine their top risks, which are actively managed and regularly reviewed with the business unit’s leadership team.
For additional detail on the critical role the Board’s Committees and senior management play in the execution of risk management, please see the Ensuring Responsible Governance section of this report.
Environmental Governance. 
GM reduces operational risks through sound environmental management and by prioritizing compliance. We measure and manage natural resources used at all manufacturing locations, engineering centers, parts distribution centers and proving ground sites around the world.
These facilities vary in function, geography, size and surrounding natural environments, which gives rise to varying concerns such as resource scarcity, different regulatory requirements and varying levels of environmental quality. These GM-owned and -operated facilities have location-specific operating plans that all function under GM’s global Environmental Policy.

In addition to GM’s Environmental Policy, which provides guidelines to help minimize the impact of our activities, products and services on the environment, GM manages climate-related risks through: • Setting environmental commitments which encourage environmental consciousness in both daily conduct and in the planning of future products and programs.
• Implementing an environmental management system at all manufacturing facilities that GM owns and operates, and at a majority of our nonmanufacturing sites around the world.
• Complying with applicable environmental laws and regulations globally.
• Monitoring GM’s performance according to GM’s own. 
Environmental Performance Criteria, which are universal corporate performance requirements designed to protect human health and the environment in accordance with the GM Environmental Policy.
• Providing strategic training and guidance to our environmental professionals to help them keep pace with evolving environmental issues and best practices that could have application worldwide.
• Publicly disclosing climate-related environmental performance through reporting frameworks such as GRI, SASB and CDP, in addition to TCFD. These reporting processes not only help us to manage and measure our progress, but also to engage with both internal and external stakeholders around the world.
Learn more in the Environmental Management discussion in the Ensuring Responsible Governance section of this report.
Supply Chain Risks. 
GM is working diligently to further integrate environmental sustainability into all aspects of our supply chain functions. A crossenterprise GPSC Sustainability Team is supporting this effort through their focus on supply chain carbon footprint reduction—concentrating on Scope 3 emissions to include: • Emissions disclosure—Increasing visibility and supplier engagement in carbon footprint reduction through tracking of CDP engagement by select Tier I suppliers.
• Sustainable logistics—Increasing shipping container packing density, route efficiency monitoring, supplier emissions reduction and alternative fuels.
In 2021, key activities included holding energy and water treasure hunts and virtual symposia for suppliers. Energy treasure hunts collectively provided recommendations to save 3,300 MWh of energy and 6,600 cubic meters of water and to eliminate 3,158 MT of CO2 emissions. Also in 2021, GPSC increased participation among selected suppliers in its annual CDP Supply Chain Initiative to over 98% of surveyed suppliers. Learn more in Supporting Supplier Responsibility.

Engineering estimate from site water balance for evaporation in Assembly plants = 30%. Using standard calculation: Withdrawal—Discharge is inaccurate due to ground water infiltration at plant discharge. 3. GM measures and monitors 100% of our major facilities’ water withdrawals by source using either invoices or meter data on a monthly basis. It is tracked in a global utility database by source, and the data is verified by an independent third party annually. Some small facilities (offices) have water service included in their lease rate, and we do not track the water withdrawal. Our estimate is that this represents less than 1% of our water withdrawal by source, so we measure and monitor 99% of water withdrawal by source. Intensity is calculated by withdrawal/vehicle production (M-Schedule where we monitor water use).

GRI Index SASB Response TCFD Response UN SDGs UNGC Data Center Assurance Statements 2021 VERIFICATION STATEMENT - GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY 1. 
Statement of Verification. 
Introduction Stantec Consulting Ltd. (Stantec) was contracted by General Motors Company (GM) to conduct an independent third-party verification of a selection of greenhouse gas (GHG) and sustainability data assertions (the Assertions) for their Global Facilities.
In this work, GM was responsible for the collection of activity data used in the calculations, data management, completion of the calculations, and preparation of the report that contains the Assertions.
Stantec was responsible for planning and executing the verification to deliver a limited level of assurance opinion as to whether the Assertions are presented fairly and in accordance with the verification criteria. Stantec is accredited with the ANSI National Accreditation Board (ANAB), a member of the International Accreditation Forum (IAF), in accordance with ISO 14065 (Accreditation ID #0805 issued to Stantec Consulting Ltd. for GHG verification and validation).
Intended User The results of the verification will be used by GM for internal and external sustainability reporting, and for reporting to CDP. The users of this statement are GM, shareholders and the public.
Verification Objective The objective of the verification was to assess whether the GHG and sustainability data assertions (as presented in Table 1) for GM’s 2021 operations are accurately prepared in accordance with appropriate criteria.
Verification Boundaries The boundaries of the verification include GM owned and operated facilities within General Motors North America (GMNA), General Motors South America (GMSA) and General Motors International Operations (GMIO). A subset of GM facilities has been excluded from the Assertions, and a list of these excluded facilities has been provided to Stantec and included in the detailed verification report for transparency.
Reporting Period The verification was conducted for the period of January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021.

Statement of Verification. 
Introduction Stantec Consulting Ltd. (Stantec) was contracted by General Motors Company (GM) to conduct an independent third-party verification of a selection of greenhouse gas (GHG) and sustainability data assertions (the Assertions) for their Global Facilities.
In this work, GM was responsible for the collection of activity data used in the calculations, data management, completion of the calculations, and preparation of the report that contains the Assertions.
Stantec was responsible for planning and executing the verification to deliver a limited level of assurance opinion as to whether the Assertions are presented fairly and in accordance with the verification criteria. Stantec is accredited with the ANSI National Accreditation Board (ANAB), a member of the International Accreditation Forum (IAF), in accordance with ISO 14065 (Accreditation ID #0805 issued to Stantec Consulting Ltd. for GHG verification and validation).
Intended User The results of the verification will be used by GM for internal and external sustainability reporting, and for reporting to CDP. The users of this statement are GM, shareholders and the public.
Verification Objective The objective of the verification was to assess whether the GHG and sustainability data assertions (as presented in Table 1) for GM’s 2020 operations are accurately prepared in accordance with appropriate criteria.
Verification Boundaries The boundaries of the verification include GM owned and operated facilities within General Motors North America (GMNA), General Motors South America (GMSA) and General Motors International Operations (GMIO). A subset of GM facilities has been excluded from the Assertions, and a list of these excluded facilities has been provided to Stantec and included in the detailed verification report for transparency.
