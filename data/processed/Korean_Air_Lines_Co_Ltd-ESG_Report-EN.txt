04 OTHER INFORMATION 03 ESG PERFORMANCE 02 ISSUE REPORT 01 COMPANY OVERVIEW. 
It’s truly good to hear that the COVID-19 pandemic, which has wreaked havoc upon our lives, has begun to come under control and show signs of abating. As we’ve come a long way in overcoming the difficulties posed by the pandemic, I sincerely hope that everything, including our daily lives, starts to recover and become normalized soon.
The aviation industry has also been through unprecedented challenges. However, despite the difficulties, Korean Air achieved a record-high operating profit, thanks to your support and our continued efforts to carry out management activities focused on ESG.
The COVID-19 pandemic crisis has given us a valuable opportunity to realize and learn how to respond to rapid changes in the business environment to achieve sustainable growth and what responsibilities we have as a member of the global community to drive shared growth and coexistence.
Greetings! I would like to extend my sincere gratitude to our shareholders, customers, partners, and employees for your continued interest and support.
CEO MESSAGE 05 2022 Korean Air ESG Report


04 OTHER INFORMATION 03 ESG PERFORMANCE 02 ISSUE REPORT 01 COMPANY OVERVIEW. 
As a global airline that has learned a valuable lesson from overcoming the pandemic, Korean Air is implementing and strengthening ESG activities from the following perspectives:
First of all, we are actively taking part in measures to respond to climate change, an area of interest in the global community.
Member airlines agreed to commit to net-zero carbon emissions from the aviation industry by 2050 in the IATA Annual General Meeting held in October 2021.
As part of our efforts to respond to climate change, we have signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Hyundai Oilbank in June 2021 regarding building a foundation for the manufacturing and usage of sustainable aviation fuel.
Second, we strive to continue to strengthen our safety management system, with our priority on safety.
In addition to the “Care First” program, an integrated hygiene management program to prevent the spread of COVID-19, we have restructured our safety and health management system to continue to ensure the safety of our customers and employees.
Third, we are actively fulfilling our corporate social responsibilities and carrying out transparent and ethical management activities.
We have established and are operating the ESG Committee within the Board of. 
Directors and entrenched mid-to-long-term ESG-driven strategies to improve our management fundamentals. We will also continue to actively disclose ESG information to further strengthen external communication.
Korean Air is striving to obtain approval from 6 countries, including the United. 
States, EU, and China to complete the acquisition and merger with Asiana Airlines following the approval from the Korea Fair Trade Commission in February 2022.
Both before and after the acquisition of Asiana Airlines, as Korean Air, we will do our best to fulfill our responsibilities and roles as a leading global network airline with strengths in not only structural competitiveness, but also in ESG.
We ask for your continued support and interest. Thank you.

Passenger Business Strategies. 
Consumers’ travel sentiment is slowly recovering as the government changed its tone from a phase-by-phase recovery plan for international flights to early normalization following a decrease in COVID-19 confirmed cases, which continued to increase and decrease earlier in 2022. Korean Air’s passenger business swiftly responded to market changes with active and flexible supply strategies, and has implemented the following operational strategies to go beyond normalization of demand and solidify our mid- to long-term growth strategies.
Comprehensive efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19 while prioritizing customer safety •Continuously update “CARE FIRST,” the comprehensive program aiming to prevent disease across the entire customer journey • Maintain a close cooperation system for each country’s quarantine measures. 
Implementation of stable reopening strategies by responding in a timely manner to market changes •Pursue profitability improvement by flexibly adjusting to supply in response to changes in entry regulations and demand •Satisfy pent-up demand by operating ad hoc flights to quarantine-free destinations. 
Building a sustainable foundation for future growth • Improve fuel efficiency and reduce carbon emissions by adopting Boeing's B737-8, a next-generation eco-friendly aircraft • Promote the quality of services provided to customers by introducing non-face-to-face services and expanding digitalization, including bio self-boarding and an e-DOC system. 
Cargo Business Strategies. 
The cargo business sector is expected to continue to show strong demand due to recovery of daily operations and increase in consumption/investment. At the same time, market volatility is also expected to continue throughout the year because of the global supply-chain crisis and unstable economic indicators, including consumer prices, oil prices, and exchange rates. Korean Air will implement the following business initiatives to preemptively respond to changes in market demand/supply and achieve sustainable growth.
Contribution to stabilization of logistics with stable supply • Supply-chain issues are expected to continue throughout 2022 due to the spread of COVID-19 variants and bottlenecks at ports/airports • Continue to expand supply by utilizing materials to the fullest and minimizing product losses in the supply chain by stabilizing operations • Meet base demand for flights by providing stable supply and fulfilling urgent requests for transportation support for disease prevention. 
Securing demand in advance and responding proactively to changing market conditions •Increased market volatility from diverse variables including COVID-19, the supply chain issue, and instability in economic indicators • Increase in large shipper volume and securing demand in advance through introduction of air cargo charters •Flexible responses to changes in market demand/supply by continuing to operate cargo freighters. 
Continued public-private partnerships for stronger export competitiveness •Guarantee stable supply of domestic agricultural exports by signing a partnership with Korea Agro-Fisheries Trade Corp.
•Sign an MOU with KITA to support freight charges and supply for small and medium – sized enterprises •Continuous efforts for public-private cooperation to promote the competitiveness of domestic small and medium-sized exporting companies and their products * 2022 Outlook for Major Institutions (YoY): IATA (air cargo demand +4.9%),
WTO (world merchandise trade volume +4.7%)
Aerospace Business Strategies. 
With the global economy slowly recovering from the impact of COVID-19, the aerospace industry is also expected to show a gradual recovery. To promote the aerospace business, we are actively establishing and implementing strategies for sustainable growth and responding to changes in the global business environment.
Responding to changes in the business environment and building a foundation for reformation •Specialize/systematize domestic and global supply chains to secure stabilization and stable production • Restructure organization and reinforce inter-organizational communication to respond to business environment changes • Prepare for production recovery by identifying/preventing possible quality risks at home and abroad and building a mechanism for preventive quality management. 
Eliminate inefficiencies and promote competitiveness through productivity improvement •Maximize efficiency by stabilizing the Manufacturing Execution System (MES) and strengthening convenience •Optimize production/operation by continuing to improve working environments, routes, processes, and factors that affect safety •Improve the system for business planning and cost-management processes to reduce planning time and enhance accuracy. 
Establishment of a system that supports sustainable growth •Focus on promoting technological capabilities and competency of human resources to win bids for/execute major projects • Secure technological competitiveness and enhance sophistication by developing leading technologies in keeping with the market trends • Pursue a transition into a knowledge-intensive business by developing/applying new business models and technologies.

Overcoming COVID-19 15 04 OTHER INFORMATION 02 ISSUE REPORT 01 COMPANY OVERVIEW 03 ESG PERFORMANCE 2022 Korean Air ESG Report


Background and Purpose of Acquisition. 
Mergers and acquisitions have been actively taking place among global airline companies since the 2000s. Major examples of mergers and acquisitions in the United States include Delta Air Lines’ acquisition of Northwest Airlines in 2008; United Airlines’ acquisition of Continental Airlines in 2010; and American Airlines’ acquisition of US Airways in 2013. Cases in Europe include Air France’s merger with KLM in 2004; Lufthansa’s acquisition of Swiss International Air Lines, Austrian Airlines, Eurowings(Germany), Air Berlin, and Brussels Airlines (Belgium) from 2007 to 2018; and British Airways’ acquisition of Iberia Airlines (Spain), Vueling Airlines (Spain), and Aer Lingus (Ireland) from 2011 to 2015. Before the outbreak of the pandemic, these large-sized airline companies have recorded strong performances by realizing economies of scale through M&A activities.
On the other hand, Korea’s business environment makes it difficult for large-sized airlines to realize economies of scale as the resources of the airline industry are shared between Korean Air and Asiana Airlines. Whereas a large number of countries including Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Russia, India, and Mexico have only one large-sized airline, there are two representative companies in Korea. Amidst the intense competition with global airlines, the operating profit of both Korean Air and Asiana Airlines has continued to trend downward every year since 2016, and Asiana Airlines even received a capital injection from the government in 2019 before seeking to sell the company. Accordingly, we decided to acquire Asiana Airlines in November 2020 to overcome the COVID-19 crisis, and secure enough competitiveness to stand in comparison with global players in the airline industry by establishing a sustainable business structure through expansion.
Due Diligence and PMI Plan. 
Immediately after deciding on the acquisition, Korean Air set up an acquisition committee and conducted due diligence on Asiana Airlines for three months from December 2020. A Post-Merger Integration (PMI) plan was established based on these due diligence findings. Our finalized PMI plan includes integration plans for all of Asiana Airline’s subsidiaries, estimation of integrated synergy and cost, and market concerns including employee retention. More specifically, the plan outlines mergers between the two large-sized airlines, Korean Air and Asiana Airlines; and with Jin Air, Air Busan, Air Seoul’s acquisition of low-cost carriers; a merger between Korea Airports Corporation and Asiana Airport’s groundhandling service provider; and a merger between HIST and Asiana IDT Inc.’s IT company. The integration project for combining the two major airlines is expected to take approximately two years. The extensive project will require the establishment of a system for safe flights, and integration of mileage, human resources and organizations, and IT systems. We are expecting to see the operating project improve by approximately KRW 300 billion to 400 billion annually as a synergistic effect of the merger. The unavoidable costs expected to be incurred during the integration process are estimated to be about KRW 600 billion. The plan also covers schemes for post-merger, including employee retention and plans to address market concerns over potential excessive increases in airfares. 

ISSUE 1 16 04 OTHER INFORMATION 02 ISSUE REPORT 01 COMPANY OVERVIEW 03 ESG PERFORMANCE 2022 Korean Air ESG Report


Review and Approval of the Business Combination. 
Korean Air and Asiana Airlines have to obtain approval from the competition commissions of various destination countries to proceed with the merger. Accordingly, we filed notices of the intended merger with Asiana Airlines with a total of 13 countries from January 14, 2021. The Turkish Competition Authority was the first to approve it in February 2021, a month after the filing, followed by Taiwan (May 2021), Thailand (May 2021), Malaysia (September 2021), Vietnam (November 2021), and Singapore (February 2022).
In February 2022, the Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) conditionally approved the business merger, and we are currently awaiting approval from the USA, the European Union, China, Japan, the United Kingdom, and Australia. Korean Air will make every effort to successfully complete the business combination to secure the long-term structural competitiveness of Korea’s aviation industry.
Expected Outcomes of Merger. 
It is expected to take two years for the merger between Korean Air and Asiana Airlines to become finalized after obtaining approval and incorporating subsidiaries. During the two years of preparation, we will use the resources and supply capabilities strengthened as a result of the merger to restructure our airline network. We will offer a variety of flight options to not only our domestic passengers, but also transit passengers by reorganizing the flights operated by Korean Air and Asiana Airlines at the same time and introducing more scheduled flights instead. Consumers will gain more benefits by enjoying a wider variety of flight options, which will translate into better performance for the Korean Air-Asiana combined entity.
The combined company aims to realize structural cost-savings, in addition to an increase in revenue. We plan to reduce the cost of aircraft by replacing Asiana Airline’s high-cost leased planes with low-cost planes owned by the company. In addition, Korean Air’s engineers can help with the maintenance of Asiana Airline’s aircraft engines, thereby reducing outsourcing costs.
Furthermore, economies of scale will be realized across all business sectors, which will promote efficiency and productivity, and reduce unit costs. The structural cost-savings will lead to more competitive airfares and higher profit margins, which will serve as a foundation for sustainable growth.
Moreover, the combined entity’s stronger route network will once again solidify Incheon Airport’s position as the hub of Northeast Asia. In addition, the solid growth resulting from the merger is expected to contribute to the national economy in various ways, including shared growth of related industries, creation of new jobs, increase in the influx of foreign currency, and enhanced logistics competitiveness of exporting companies. Passengers will be able to enjoy a broader range of Korean Air’s global-leading services than before, and through the integration of Skypass and Asiana Club, passengers will be able to use their airline miles for more purposes. The employees of Korean Air and Asiana Airlines will endeavor to transform it into a completely new airline well-loved by all.

Korean Air’s Revenue Passenger Kilometers (RPK) for 2021 declined by 90% compared to 2019, and although travel bubbles were introduced as a result of increased vaccination rates, we continued to witness a drop in passenger demand with travel restrictions being reinforced once again due to the spread of variants. Our passenger business has continued to implement operational strategies to swiftly respond to the fast-paced market and changes in demand. At the same time, we have made every effort to strengthen service competitiveness in preparation for demand recovery.
When the global air cargo supply dropped, Korean Air seized the opportunity and expanded the number of cargo freighters used for the cargo business and removed cabin seats to fill the spaces with cargo instead. We have also contributed to overcoming the global pandemic through the transportation of COVID-19 vaccines. Despite a decrease in passenger-business revenue, Korean Air has achieved an operating profit of KRW 1.4644 trillion, the highest ever since the company was first established, by promoting the competitiveness of the cargo business and reducing operating expenses.
Passenger Business’s Efforts to Overcome COVID-19. 
Phased steps to normalize supply of routes Korean Air continued to implement flexible operation of routes based on the plan to take phased steps to increase supply of routes. In the early days of COVID-19, the airline strived to secure demand created as a result of the pandemic, including domestic flights and chartered flights to bring back Korean nationals living abroad, and immediately changed its route operation when the travel restrictions of each country changed. In addition, we have made every effort to secure seasonal/event demand during “With Corona”, including demand for flights during the traditional holidays, vacation seasons for students studying in the United States, and flights for the Olympic teams and media groups. From the end of 2021, we started to increase our international flight operations, including routes to Hawaii and Guam, locations that do not require quarantine for fully vaccinated travelers.
We’re expecting faster recovery in demand in the second quarter of 2022, with countries around the world easing their travel restrictions and our government also announcing that it will lift restrictions imposed on the operation of international flights. Maintaining the tone to steadily increase supply, the passenger business is pushing ahead with its plan to expand the operation of regular flights, centered on long-distance flights and flights to Southeast Asia. Our plan is to operate more than 300 international flights a week from the summer peak season, which is a 150% increase compared to the average in 2021. We are actively pursuing normalization of supply especially for flights to the Americas, which is a route that showed the fastest recovery in supply, by utilizing large aircraft such as A380 and B747-8i.
Expansion of non-face-to-face services Even amidst the pandemic, Korean Air has pushed ahead with efforts to improve customer services in the passenger business. In January, Korean Air became the first airline to acquire the Consumer Centered Management (CCM) certification, certified by the Korea Fair Trade Commission and operated by Korea Consumer Agency. Starting with the CCM certification, we have continued to win various awards from prestigious institutions at home and abroad for the quality of our services. By creating a better service environment including the launch of a new website for the passenger business and self-check-in service in 2021, we have built and improved the foundation for services throughout the entire process of flight reservation, ticketing, and boarding.

According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), air passenger transport around the world in 2021 decreased by 76% compared to the same period in 2019 due to the decrease in demand for travel following the COVID-19 pandemic and entry restrictions imposed by countries. Despite the 11% decrease in global cargo supply compared to the same period in 2019 due to the real economy shrinking from COVID-19 and decrease in cargo supply using cargo belly space, the overall air cargo traffic has increased by 7% compared to 2019 due to issues such as the shipping backlogs.

Improving Competitiveness of the Cargo Business. 
Increasing profitability by expanding supply The delayed recovery of the passenger aircraft belly cargo capacity due to the spread of the COVID-19 variant and the global supply chain crisis have led to a shortage in air cargo capacity. Against this backdrop, Korean Air made every effort to achieve stable supply and operations by utilizing resources in the most efficient manner. First, our cargo aircraft utilization was improved by 7% compared to the previous year through efficient scheduled operations, and we continued to create demand and expand supply by operating more cargo freighters. In particular, our cargo freighters were operated over 10,000 times in 2021 on a cumulative basis, which comprises around 20% of our overall cargo supply. As such, our cargo freighters played a pivotal role in expanding supply. Furthermore, we have enhanced the competitiveness of our cargo freighters by adding ten new B777 aircraft, which can carry cargo in their cabins, and six fuel-efficient A330 planes whose seats can be removed to reduce basic empty weight. As a result, our Available Cargo Tonne Kilometers (ACTK) has shown a 17% increase compared to the previous year, and our stable supply operations have increased the revenue by 57% compared to the previous year despite the global supply-chain crisis.
Transportation of COVID-19 vaccines In addition to acquiring CEIV Pharma, an IATA international standard qualification for pharmaceutical transport, in June 2019, Korean Air established a task force dedicated to vaccine transportation in September 2020 to bolster efforts to strengthen the vaccine cold chain. We have especially put focus on strengthening the cold chain and expanding infrastructure to provide customized temperature-control services, taking into consideration that each vaccine requires different transport and storage conditions according to the vaccine manufacturer, varying from ultra-cold temperatures at -70°C, regular freezer temperature of -20°C, and fridge temperatures of 2~8°C. Gaining recognition for our global supply chain, special cargo transport capability, and expertise in pharmaceutical transportation, we have signed a business agreement with UNICEF, the UN's international relief organization, and COVAX Facility in February 2021 for global transportation of COVID-19 vaccines.

With swift, safe, and flawless cold chain services, Korean Air became the first airline in Korea to transport AstraZeneca vaccines manufactured domestically to other Asian countries including Thailand and Vietnam in February 2021. We have also safely transported the first batch of Pfizer vaccines from Amsterdam to Incheon, maintaining the temperature below -70°C. As the Korean government began to roll out COVID-19 vaccinations from the second half of 2021, Korean Air has made company-wide efforts to work closely with the government to support stable vaccine supply and transportation, including provision of flight schedules. In addition, Korean Air has supported the export of domestically produced vaccines based on our global network and expertise, and transported a total of around 100 million doses of vaccines from the Americas/Europe to Southeast Asia. As such, Korean Air, as Korea’s national flag farrier, has contributed to overcoming the global pandemic by supporting the transportation of vaccines.

Korean Air implements in-flight resource circulation initiatives to enhance recycling rates and reduce the amount of aircraft cabin waste in order to provide sustainable airline services that contribute to customer satisfaction and environmental protection.
Korean Air has made a variety of efforts to reduce the amount of cabin waste. We have changed the design of plastic cup lids and lids covering in-flight meals to reduce the amount of single-use plastics that are highly likely to go to waste. As a result, we were able to reduce our plastic usage by around 338 tons in 2021 compared to 2019. In addition, we have modified the sizing and specification of disposable hand towels placed in restrooms according to their purpose. As a result, we achieved the same effect as reducing pulp usage by approximately 104 tons per year, which is equivalent to 2,496 trees. We have no other option but to use disposable products these days as preventative measures for Covid-19, but we plan to gradually replace the items currently used inside the airplane with eco-friendly (biodegradable plastics, paper products, etc.) products in order to reduce the amount of cabin waste.
Korean Air has reduced the use of disposable products and adopted items that can be reused to reduce the amount of waste generated. In 2021, we reduced the amount of waste generated from disposables by changing the seat headrest covers from disposable non-woven fabric to synthetic leather. We disinfect and wash the reusable covers when cleaning the interior of the aircraft. These eco-friendly headrest covers are currently only used on domestic flights and small-sized planes, but we plan to use them also for international flights after diversifying the type of materials used.
Korean Air has adopted new methods to increase the recycling rate of cabin waste. We have held campaigns and training sessions to improve our cabin crew’s awareness on recycling and are making efforts to recycle and separately collect each type of trash. We have also recently designed recycling bags that will be used for the separate collection of trash, which are expected to contribute to increasing the recycling rate of cabin waste.
Korean Air strives to minimize the impact that aircraft ground handling has on the environment. We have completely replaced plastic wraps used to prevent the luggage and cargo from getting damaged with eco-friendly renewable vinyl. Up to 50% of the materials used to make the renewable vinyl are reused, including waste vinyl, and while the performance is similar to that of traditional vinyl, the new renewable vinyl is expected to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by more than 50%. Accordingly, we can replace the 350 tons of vinyl used annually for operations with environmentally friendly vinyl.

In 2020, Korean Air became the first airline in Korea to upcycle the dismantled parts of the retired Boeing 777 aircraft as completely new products. Since then, in September 2021, the airline has created name tags and golf ball markers out of parts of the Boeing 747-400 aircraft, which was dubbed the “Queen of the Skies.” In particular, the Boeing 747-400 (HL7461) aircraft, whose parts have been upcycled, was the last of the Boeing 747-400 aircraft owned by Korean Air that played a vital role in our growth into a global airline. The HL7461 aircraft that was used as a charter plane for Korean nationals living abroad who were stranded due to COVID-19 in 2020, has after retirement become a new product through upcycling, offered to passengers who have had limited opportunity to spend their mileage due to travel restrictions. As a leader in the domestic aircraft upcycling sector, we will continue to strengthen our upcycling practices by using retired aircraft and other materials to realize the circulation of resources and reduce waste as part of our social contribution activities.

Response to Climate Change. 
Objectives of Response to Climate Change. 
At the Annual General Meeting of IATA, the 'United Nations of the aviation industry,' held in October 2021, major airlines around the world including Korean Air approved a resolution for the global air transport industry to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. According to IATA, a cumulative total of 21.2 Gt of carbon should be reduced by 2050 to achieve carbon neutrality. Strategies to reduce carbon emissions include using sustainable aviation fuel, developing new aviation technology such as hydrogen, and using carbon capture/storage technologies.
As a global airline leading the industry, Korean Air not only implements diverse strategies to achieve carbon emissions reduction in support of the aviation industry’s response to climate change, but also collaborates with various stakeholders including the government, oil companies, and aircraft manufacturers to actively develop and use means to reduce emissions in the future.
Contribution to achieving Net Zero Carbon by 2050. 
In 2021, the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) adopted the Glasgow Climate Pact, and the participating governments and private sectors delivered their commitments on reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and investments in decarbonization, emphasizing the need for international efforts to combat climate change. In line with the global community’s joint efforts, Korea has introduced a plan to achieve “carbon neutrality by 2050” and to “cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 40% below 2018 levels by 2030.“
The aviation industry, which is responsible for approximately 3% of the world’s carbon emissions, has also emphasized the need for joint efforts to respond to climate change, despite the unprecedented disruption caused by COVID-19. IATA member airlines agreed to commit to carbon neutrality by 2050 at the IATA Annual General Meeting held in October 2021.
Since Korean Air obtained ISO14001 (Environmental Management System) certification in 1996, the airline has implemented an environmental management system compliant with international standards across all areas of business, including transportation, aircraft maintenance, and aerospace. In addition, an ESG committee within the Board of Directors has been established to resolve environmental issues including climate change. With regard to climate change in particular, Korean Air has defined achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, a target announced by IATA, as the airline’s key objective and is making various efforts to minimize the risk of climate change by taking preemptive measures. As a short term measure, we aim to reduce emissions by introducing eco-friendly aircraft and improving fuel efficiency, and in the mid- to long-term, we are making preparations to realize an energy transition by purchasing sustainable aviation fuel and hydrogen, or electrically powered aircraft.

Governance on Response to Climate Change. 
The role of the Board of Directors on climate change risks and opportunities. 
The ESG committee established within the Board of Directors of Korean Air consists of four independent directors with expertise, who review ESG strategies and policies, manage the ESG implementation status, and give advice on and make decisions for agendas that have a significant impact on shareholder value. In particular, response to climate change is one of the main tasks emphasized by the ESG committee. Every quarter, the ESG committee reviews climate change issues in depth and recommends the future direction for the company as well as mid- to long-term strategies to combat climate change.
Assessment and management system of climate change risks & opportunities. 
The analysis and evaluation on factors associated with Korean Air’s climate change risk and opportunity are systematically conducted by the C-Level executives and the environmental management organization. The Environment Team is responsible for analyzing company-wide responses to resolve climate change and comprehensive risk assessment. We have also appointed an executive-level manager and established an organization responsible for environmental management in the transportation, aircraft maintenance, and aerospace business areas. The dedicated team from each business area analyzes major business performances and risks related to climate change, and submits reports on them to the Management Team. The executive in charge of the Environment Team evaluates major issues, and then submits reports on them to the C-Level executives at least once per year. In addition, major issues identified by the environmental management organizations are reported to the Board of Directors and the ESG committee for review and advice.
Efforts to Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions. 
Sustainable aviation fuel. 
Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is an alternative fuel made from sustainable raw materials, including used cooking oil, agricultural byproducts, and waste. SAF can be used together with conventional jet fuel and can reduce emissions by up to 80% compared to fossil fuel derived aviation fuel. SAF is one of the main methods the aviation industry can use to reduce carbon emissions, and according to IATA, SAF could contribute around 65% of the reduction in emissions needed by the aviation industry to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.
Although SAF currently comprises only 0.1% of the overall aviation fuel usage due to shortages in production facilities and supply chain, European countries and the United States have recently begun to implement policies and provide investment support to expand the use of sustainable aviation fuel.
SAF is typically three to five times more expensive than conventional jet fuel with limited production. Therefore, institutional incentives and infrastructure for production and refueling are required, but compared to Europe and the United States, Korea is not yet sufficiently prepared.

Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Efficiency. 
To resolve the shortcomings and expand the use of SAF in the aviation industry, Korean Air signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Hyundai Oilbank, a leading petroleum and refinery company in Korea, regarding the manufacturing and usage of SAF in June last year. The two companies agreed to actively cooperate to develop a foundation for domestic production and use, and to conduct market research and R&D activities. Furthermore, Korean Air has partnered with SK Energy to promote consumer awareness of eco-friendly flights. Through the partnership, the airline has operated domestic flights departing from Jeju and Cheongju using carbon-neutral jet fuel for a month. The carbon-neutral jet fuel is achieved through the purchase of carbon credits, which offset the total amount of greenhouse gases emitted through the use of conventional jet fuel.
Meanwhile, Korean Air is actively reviewing the possibility of using SAF for flights departing from airports in international locations, where the supply is stable. We have used SAF on the route between Paris and Incheon since February this year for the first time in Korea. Korean Air is actively working with various stakeholders, including the government, oil refineries, and the airport to establish a foundation for the introduction of SAF in Korea, and will expand the use of SAF by participating in multilateral efforts to introduce SAF both in Korea and abroad.
Eco-friendly aircraft. 
The introduction of high-efficiency aircraft is the most effective way of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving fuel efficiency in the aviation sector. Korean Air maintains an average fleet age of 11.3 years, the lowest among domestic Full Service Carriers (FSCs), through the company’s strategy to actively introduce new high-efficiency aircraft. The newly introduced A220-300, B787-9, and B7378 aircraft are high-efficiency models that reduce carbon emissions per seat by 20~25% compared to the existing models with similar capacity. In particular, the A220-300 and B787-9 aircraft, Korean Air’s leading models, are operated for short domestic routes and long-distance international routes respectively and are leading the way in low-carbon flying.
Furthermore in July, last year, Korean Air became the first airline in Korea to issue ESG bonds worth KRW 350 billion to introduce high-efficiency B787-10 aircraft and received the highest rating for the green bond. As such, through active plans to introduce high-efficiency aircraft, Korean Air is preparing for the transition into a low carbon society.

Engine Water Wash 작업
Engine Water Wash is one example that shows what Korean Air is doing to improve efficiency of its flights.
ENGINE WATER WASH. 
Engine Water Wash is a technology that removes foreign substances from the jet engine combustion chamber and compressor, thereby improving the flow of air within the engine to enhance combustion efficiency. It is especially effective when fine particulate matter concentrations are high. Generally, aircraft engines are washed by spraying water at a certain pressure using a water tank truck, and certified wax is used during the winter season to prevent the engines from getting frozen. Taking into account that the effect of engine wash and duration may differ according to how long the flights were operated and aircraft model/engine type, Korean Air secures optimal engine efficiency by reviewing and applying the optimal wash frequency per engine type.
In 2021, Korea Air achieved around 8.34 million pounds (around 11,952 tons of carbon reduction) of flight efficiency improvement through Engine Water Wash, even despite the decrease in flight operations due to COVID-19.
Example of Flight Efficiency Improvement. 
Improvement of flight efficiency. 
Recognizing improvement of flight efficiency as a major task, Korean Air is striving to put in place concrete and practical improvement plans. Korean Air continues to discover and work on tasks related to improving fuel efficiency in areas including operation of flights, maintenance, operation of airports, and flight plans. Through technology transfer, we also greatly contribute to emissions reduction in the aviation industry as a whole, including the airlines in Korea. Korean Air is carrying out approximately 70 tasks to improve fuel efficiency, and in 2021, we were able to reduce carbon emissions by approximately 275,200 tons through these efforts in spite of the reduction in flights due to COVID-19.
In addition, Korean Air plans to introduce an AI/Machine-Learning based fuel management system by the second half of 2022 to build the infrastructure necessary for flexibly responding to changes in the environment, as well as systematically improving the current fuel management system, and identifying potential inefficiencies.
Going forward, Korean Air will continue to strive to take active steps to improve efficiency of flights, and promote its ability to reduce carbon emissions in the aviation industry through collaboration with stakeholders including airports, and ground handling service providers.

Developing Eco-Friendly Aviation Technology. 
Korean Air is equipped with high competitiveness in aviation technology, including aircraft maintenance. Against this backdrop, we are striving to further develop future eco-friendly aviation technology, a major future growth engine.
Manufacturing Eco-Friendly Aircraft Parts Korean Air Aerospace Division, as an aircraft parts manufacturer, is taking part in low-carbon aviation technology research, as well as designing and manufacturing various eco-friendly aircraft parts. We are, for instance, a manufacturer of A320/A330 NEO Sharklet, B787 Raked Wingtip, and B737 MAX Winglet, wing components that reduce drag at the tip of the wing, and in turn improve fuel efficiency. These components are currently being supplied to Airbus and Boeing.
Since 2019, we have promoted a joint development project on the next-generation winglet structure, made of composite material, titled “Wing of Tomorrow” with Airbus. In 2021, we completed the development and making of the process technology and jigs used in the manufacturing process, and in 2022, we are planning to provide initial supply.
Urban Air Mobility R&D Recently, UAM (Urban Air Mobility) has been gaining popularity as a next-generation transportation system capable of tackling environmental pollution. UAM, as an eco-friendly aviation technology, feeds on electricity, not fossil fuel, which mitigates carbon emissions and noise pollution. Korean Air is strengthening technological cooperation with government organizations, corporations, and laboratories so as to establish a stable UAM ecosystem, while actively working to set up and stabilize relevant infrastructures and operational control systems.
From June 2020, we have been participating as an initial member of “UAM Team Korea,” an industrial-academia cooperation project. In order to facilitate the success of domestic UAM, Hyundai Motor Company, Hyundai Engineering & Construction Company, Incheon International Airport Corporation and KT Corporation came together to form a five-organization consortium.
Korean Air aims to converge its experience in air transportation and the technology used in the development and maintenance of manned and unmanned aircraft, in order to develop a business model adequate for our domestic business environment and accordingly provide an integrated service.
Cooperation on introducing hydrogen fuel Ahead of introducing hydrogenpowered aircraft, we have signed a “Memorandum of Understanding To Develop Hydrogen Supply and Infrastructure for Airports and Aviation in South Korea” with Incheon International Airport, Airbus Korea, and Air Liquide Korea. This MOU is in line with Airbus’ ambition to commercialize hydrogen-powered aircraft by the year 2035, and in this respect, Korean Air aims to propose a roadmap to ramp up hydrogen supply in various sectors including airport service, maintenance, and operation.
We are preemptively investing in eco-friendly future aviation technology to gain competitiveness in the transition to a low-carbon society.
Efforts made by the cargo business sector to cut carbon emissions. 
Using eco-friendly vinyl for cargo packaging In order to minimize greenhouse gas emissions, we have been using vinyl with a 50% mix of renewable materials such as vinyl waste, and plastic containers. Renewable vinyl, when compared to the original cargo packing material, is similar in thickness, sealing, and solidity. Thus, renewable vinyl enables safe cargo transportation, as well as reduction in plastic consumption and carbon emissions.
Reducing the weight of cargo containers Since December 2020, Korean Air is working to reduce the weight of some cargo containers. This reduction in cargo container weights enables an overall decrease in the total weight of the load added to the aircraft, and thus leads to saved gas bills and carbon emission cuts. As of 2021, by shifting to light-weight containers, we were able to achieve a 5,000-ton reduction in total load weight, which in turn led to more than 500 tons of carbon emission cuts.

Responding to Carbon Regulations. 
As market-based carbon regulations tighten, the importance of carbon cost management is increasing. Particularly, airlines operating international flights are subject to overseas carbon regulations and therefore need more systematic management. To this end, Korean Air is tightly monitoring carbon emissions from aircraft operations and ground operations. Moreover, to enhance data integrity, we are having our data inspected and verified by an independent third party every year, and everything is disclosed to external organizations. We are also managing risks related to carbon credit costs by reflecting them in our internal accounting management system.
ICAO CORSIA. 
The Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), the first global carbon regulation implemented in the aviation industry, has been in effect since 2019 and mandates airlines to purchase carbon credits to offset their excess carbon emissions compared to the base year. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a sharp decrease in the overall number of international flights, and airlines are thus currently not under such obligation. However, as demand for international flights picks up, and the base year is adjusted by ICAO, the CORSIA offset obligation will likely be reintroduced. To fulfill this mandate, Korean Air has been reporting carbon emissions caused by international flights to ICAO and the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport every year.
EU-ETS and UK-ETS. 
Since 2012, Korean Air has been under the influence of the EU-Emissions Trading System (EU-ETS), and accordingly we have been fulfilling our obligation to annually report on and settle carbon emissions for flights within the EU. Since 2020, flights operating between Switzerland and the EU countries have also been managed, along with the implementation of the Swiss-ETS in connection with the EUETS. Meanwhile, along with the UK’s withdrawal from the EU, the UK-ETS which exclusively manages UK flights, has been newly introduced.
The UK-ETS is applied to the UK’s domestic flights, flights from the UK to EEA (European Economic Area) countries, and some of Korean Air’s cargo flights from the UK. As the UK-ETS is separately managed from the EU-ETS, Korean Air is doing its due diligence to comply with relevant regulations by reporting on and settling carbon emissions in the UK.
Korea-ETS. 
The Korea-ETS has been implemented since 2015, and is currently applied to approximately 630 domestic companies. Carbon emissions coming from our domestic flights and ground facilities are managed under the Korea-ETS, and are being reported on and settled annually. Particularly, in the third period of the domestic emissions trading scheme, the proportion of priced allocation has been expanded, and as the price of carbon credits is expected to rise, carbon emission management is becoming ever more important. To cut aircraft emissions, which account for more than 80% of the total amount of emissions subject to regulation, Korean Air has actively introduced high-efficiency aircraft such as Airbus A220300. We are also actively adopting diverse carbon reduction measures, such as renewable fuels that could go carbon-neutral by being offset with carbon credits.

Managing Climate Change Related Risks. 
The Environmental Management System (EMS) team, in charge of general headquarters, aircraft maintenance, and aerospace business sectors, regularly detects and identifies climate change-related risks in the entire company. Afterwards, the EMS team and the ESG secretariat jointly conduct a comprehensive analysis and assessment of the identified risks. The EMS team consists of environmental experts, capable of carrying out in-depth assessments, and the ESG secretariat consists of experts in environment, society, finance, and management.
These in-house experts are responsible for reviewing ESG risk factors from multiple perspectives, and reporting their reviews to the ESG Committee. Risks that could impact the company’s finance and business strategy are discussed within the ESG Committee, which is entirely composed of independent directors under the BOD. The ESG Committee carries out its main role of making decisions and establishing strategies on evaluating and managing climate change-related risks.
Korean Air’s Resilience According to the Climate Change Scenario. 
Korean Air is subject to an array of carbon regulations at home and abroad and thus applies diverse carbon-cost forecasting scenarios according to the types of carbon credits and market trends of each carbon mechanism. For instance, when it comes to the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation System (CORSIA), the International Energy Agency (IEA) standard emission price is used to predict the cost of offset emissions quota for up to 2035. Meanwhile, the cost of carbon credits in the domestic market is determined by trading costs and regulatory trends. This internal prediction mechanism functions as a basis for decision making and financial management. In the future we plan to apply a 1.5℃ climate change scenario and draw out more sophisticated financial analyses.

Setting and Carrying Out Environmental Goals. 
In the year 2021, Korean Air established and implemented 54 green management goals in its general headquarters, aircraft maintenance, and aerospace business sectors. The 54 goals are composed of 21 quantitative goals (including stabilization of pollutant emissions, greenhouse gas, wastes, and resource saving) and 33 qualitative goals (including emergent response to environmental changes, and law compliance).
Inspection and Assessment System. 
In order to review and evaluate ISO14001 along with the internal environmental management system, we have organized a pool of capable talents with rich experience. Through more than one regular and random check-ups, we inspect the overall condition of the environmental management system, and if any problem is detected, we go through a process of “correcting the problem and establishing preventive measures” in order to improve the environment.
Strengthening Employees’ Environmental Capacities. 
Based on the environmental training system at the enterprise level, Korean Air provides diverse sessions on basic training, job-specific training, and on-the-job training. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the training hours in 2020 remained at only 70% of the training hours in 2019, but we have been actively utilizing "NonContact" online education programs, aiming to reduce the training hours.

Green Procurement Korean Air promotes green procurement, and accordingly has established inhouse guidelines for green procurement and is complying with this. Purchasing high-efficiency aircraft and engines, reducing the weight of aircraft loads, and purchasing certified eco-friendly goods are just some examples of our efforts in this regard. In order to reduce our carbon footprints during the flight, paper straws, paper coffee sticks, and FSC(Forest Stewardship Council)-certified paper cups began to be used during in-flight services, and eco-friendly vinyl began to be used for cargo packaging. In September 2021, flights taking off from Jeju and Cheongju were supplied with carbon-neutral jet fuel, which was an attempt to minimize environmental implications. Korean Air, as a sound corporate customer, will continue to actively take part in green procurement, in order to lead the spread of sustainable consumer culture.

Reducing Wastes and Recycling. 
Typically, in the aviation industry, various wastes are generated during aircraft maintenance, operation, and transport services. Our wastes can be generally classified as domestic waste generated from transportation services and designated waste generated from aircraft maintenance and parts manufacturing.
In 2021, we recycled 71% of the wastes, which is a 12.5% rise compared to the previous year. This was made possible due to our efforts to recycle reusable products and reduce the use of disposable products. Looking to the future, as from 2022 we plan to exert further environmental preservation efforts by converting waste synthetic resin into solid fuel, instead of simply incinerating it.

Management of Air/Water Pollutants. 
Safe Processing of Pollutants. 
Korean Air is operating a total of six wastewater treatment facilities at five business sites in Seoul-Incheon and Gimhae. In four of the sites, around 150 air pollution prevention facilities have been installed to reduce air and water pollutants. Although the emission-standards for pollutants are gradually tightening, the concentration of water pollutants and air pollutants emitted through the prevention facilities remain steadily at 1.3% and 2.8% of the legally permitted amounts respectively. In this respect, we plan to carry on with our environmental investment and further cut pollutant emissions.
Reducing NOx, the Main Driver of Particulate Matter. 
In order to cut emissions of nitrogen oxide (NOx), which is a main driver of particulate matter, Korean Air has been exerting various efforts, such as installing low-NOx burners. In 2020, by investing KRW 3 billion, we helped convert the fuel of Gimhae Tech Center’s boilers and cold and hot water dispensers into LNG, and installed low-NOx burners in the center. In the following year, we replaced a total of 16 boilers and cold and hot water dispensers in Seoul and Gyeonggi Province with low-NOx burners. In line with these efforts, aside from Jeju where LNG cannot be supplied, low-NOx burners have been installed in all air-discharge facilities. The efforts we make are contributing to the reduction of nitrogen oxide and particulate matter.

Managing Hazardous Chemicals. 
When it comes to aircraft maintenance, it is recommended that we use chemical substances designated by aircraft manufacturers. By continuously communicating with aircraft manufacturers, we are working to reduce damages coming from using such products. Moreover, we have established an in-house chemical management system, which allows us to manage information not only via Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS), but also on the storage and use of chemical substances at each business site. The system enables us to strictly control hazardous substances, and we are developing alternative eco-friendly substances by establishing and implementing the process of reviewing alternative substances in accordance with the standards of the environmental management system.

Managing Noise Pollution. 
In order to alleviate noise damage, Korean Air has added noise-reduction procedures to the company’s operating regulations and flight procedures of each aircraft model. These regulations and procedures are applied during takeoff and landing. We also comply with the noise-reduction procedures each country requires, as well as the Noise Abatement Departure Procedure (NADP) and the Continuous Descent Approach (CDA) of ICAO. Along with the development of aviation technology, we are actively supporting the shift from the original ground navigation facility (VOR, VHF Omni-directional Range)-based method to the regional navigation facility (RNAV, Area Navigation)-based method, which uses the GPS. Moving further on, the Required Navigation Performance (RNP) approach procedure is also being applied. This is a method that ensures circumventing noisesensitive areas by precisely managing flight routes. To this end, Korean Air has installed advanced satellite navigation devices and wireless facilities in its aircraft, which help minimize noise damage.
Korean Air has also introduced and operated new air fleets in order to minimize noise damage. The newly introduced fleets 787-9, 737-8, and A220-300 have all acquired the lowest noise level domestically, and release 50% less noise compared to the original fleets. Despite these efforts, however, there could be some inevitable noise emissions, to which end Korean Air is fulfilling its role of mitigating the burden of residents living in the area, by paying noise charges.

Protecting Biodiversity. 
Korean Air recognizes its role as an air-transportation company to protect biodiversity, and is actively participating in global biodiversity-protection efforts. Accordingly, we have established an internal regulation that bans the air transportation of protected animals and plants, rare animals, primates, and endangered animals. The International Air Transport Association (IATA), which consists of a total of 61 airlines, including Korean Air, signed the Buckingham Palace Declaration in 2016. This declaration slashes the illegal trade of wildlife and wildlife products and states the urgency to combat the trafficking of endangered animals. IATA is also actively pursuing biodiversity efforts through partnerships with environment protection initiatives such as the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) and Reducing Opportunities for Unlawful Transport of Endangered Species (ROUTES).

Human Rights Management. 
HR Policies That Respect Human Rights and Diversity. 
Korean Air abides by the policies and laws of each nation, and strongly prohibits all forms of forced labor, child labor, and wage exploitation, as stipulated by the regulations of the International Labor Organization (ILO). Moreover, we refrain from discrimination based on gender, age, race, religion, disability, country of origin, and political opinions ─ when it comes to hiring, appointment, evaluation, and compensation of employees. We are constantly making various efforts to strongly prevent workplace harassment and sexual harassment in the workplace. Korean Air vows to respect employees’ rights in every country, and create an optimal environment in which all employees can work safely and get treated fairly.
Operating an In-house Channel Dedicated to Respecting Employees’ Human Rights. 
Korean Air operates an in-house channel (sh_report@koreanair.com), dedicated to counseling and reporting cases of sexual and workplace harassment. The reported cases are handled in accordance with the guidance provided by the Ministry of Employment and Labor. We go through detailed investigations, in order to ensure confidentiality and prevention of secondary damage. Afterwards, by taking into consideration the investigation results and victims’ opinions, the perpetrator is referred to the Punishment Committee or separated from the victim. Moreover, we also operate an in-house channel (selipinfo@koreanair.com) dedicated to handling employees’ HR-related difficulties or personal inquiries. After investigating the cases received, we take adequate measures to handle them, and the results are then notified to the complainant. Likewise, Korean Air is consistently working to create a pleasant atmosphere in which all employees’ rights are fully respected.
As ESG management is attracting wide interest at home and abroad, companies have begun to put more emphasis on human rights management, so as to internalize ESG management in all business activities. In 2014, human rights guidelines were established domestically, and today, the Framework Act on Human Rights Policy, which stipulates the importance of human rights management, is in effect. Moreover, global investors have begun to evaluate companies’ human rights-related risks management capacities. Likewise, companies are increasingly being encouraged to respect stakeholders’ human rights, and take into account their dignities and values.
BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT. 
Based upon the 2022 materiality assessment conducted on internal and external stakeholders, human rights management issues were selected as one of the key issues. Korean Air is currently implementing policies that comply with the laws and policies of each nation, and respects diversity and human rights. We communicate with our employees through various channels, and also hold regular training sessions on human rights. Moreover, Korean Air holds labor-management council meetings in order to dissolve labor-management conflicts and promote the welfare of union members.

Human Rights Education for Employees. 
Korean Air realizes respect for human rights and promotes awareness on human rights management by conducting various training sessions. We hold the following sessions to eradicate workplace bullying and illegal discrimination, promote employees’ physical and psychological wellbeing, and provide them with a safe and healthy work environment.
Training on handling of sexual harassment and workplace harassment. 
In order to prevent cases of sexual harassment and workplace harassment, Korean Air annually conducts “Creating a Bright and Pleasant Workplace” training. At the end of the course, employees are required to sign a pledge against sexual harassment and workplace harassment. For employees who are unable to take the training course during the period due to reasons such as leave of absence, we are uploading the course to the in-house online training website.
Improving respect for people with disabilities in the workplace. 
For training on improving awareness of people with disabilities in the workplace Korean Air annually conducts “Improving awareness of people with disabilities in the workplace” training. An in-house instructor who has completed the instructor training course at the Korea Employment Agency for Persons with Disabilities (KEAD) makes and uploads the course to the in-house online training website.
Improving employees’ physical and mental welfare. 
In accordance with Article 29 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act, Korean Air has been working to enhance safety and health awareness by providing a regular training course on health every quarter. According to the study on people’s mental health during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, due to the pandemic, people are feeling increasingly depressed and suicidal. Accordingly, we have an expert in clinical psychology, always ready to provide in-house consultation for mentally distressed employees. Moreover, in order to promote our employees’ mental wellbeing and manage their workplace stress levels, we have also conducted training courses in ‘managing stress levels during the COVID-19 pandemic,’ and ‘recognizing warning signals for mental health.’ Aside from these courses, we are also providing courses titled ‘radiation and health’ and ‘seasonal health management’.

Status of Strengthened Management of Employee’s Physical Health and Mental Stress. 
According to the 2020 Community Health Survey (Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency, 2021), due to the prolonged COVID-19 pandemic, people’s physical activities sharply declined, and consumption of delivery food picked up. In the past, it was typical to get treated after the onset of a disease, but the importance of preventive health care is increasingly being emphasized during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, in accordance with the new Serious Accidents Punishment Act enacted in 2022, in order to prevent employees’ occupational diseases, companies are now required to strengthen safety and health measures and conduct health promotion activities in various fields in order to provide employees with a healthier environment to work in. Accordingly, Korean Air, with help from the Korean Air Aeromedical Center, is carrying out health promotion activities in various fields that are tailored to each occupational category, by analyzing major health problems of workers in diverse aviation professions.

Safety Management. 
With the enforcement of the Serious Accidents Punishment Act in January 2022, preventing serious industrial accidents and serious civil accidents is becoming ever more important. Aircraft accidents typically entail large-scale damages, and thus, safety management is absolutely essential in the aviation industry. In addition, with the recent changes in the aviation industry such as passenger identification verification using biometric information and the increase in drone usage, preparing relevant aviation security measures and strengthening security is required.
MANAGEMENT ENVIRONMENT. 
According to the results of the materiality assessment conducted on internal and external stakeholders in 2022, aviation safety was selected as the most important issue, just as in 2021. Korean Air has maintained a record of accident-free flights for the past 21 years through systematic flight safety management. We have also been strengthening occupational safety and health management by appointing a CSO (Chief Safety & Operating Officer) to be exclusively responsible for in-house safety and health-related tasks. Aside from these efforts, we are also establishing a preventive aviation security operation system, and we will work to soundly maintain our absolutely safe flight operation system, through continuous improvement of our safety management system.

Strengthening Korean Air’s Safety Committee. 
Korean Air established its Safety Committee under the Board of Directors in 2018, and has ever since been consistently monitoring safety measures and advising the BOD on safety-related issues, thereby maintaining an objective and transparent safety management system.
In the first half of 2021, a new independent director was appointed to the Safety Committee as part of our efforts to enhance safety independence, which in turn contributed to further improving the safety levels of Korean Air. In addition, we are providing safety education for new employees and annual SMS(Safety Management System) online education for all employees. Additionally, for executives, team leaders, and working-level employees within the SMS organization, we are providing training according to different levels and occupations, thereby maintaining our operations at the highest level of safety.

Managing Safe Operation for Continued Accident-free Operation. 
In 2021, Korean Air added another year of operation without the loss of human lives, thanks to consistent data-based flight operation management. We also achieved the national aviation safety performance goal as well as our in-house aviation safety performance goal, which allowed us to maintain an ‘acceptable’ level of safe operation. This year, we will continue to maintain this level of aviation safety by implementing a preventive ‘leading indicator’ through data analysis in each sector, so as to achieve the national safety performance goal and our in-house safety performance goal, which have been further strengthened this year.
In 2022, we plan to further advance the analysis and utilization of flight data for each crew member. After the completion of the first phase of development in 2021, we are proceeding with the second phase of development, which is to expand the scope and items of self-study data provided to crew members. Based on this data analysis, we are endeavoring to recognize potential risk factors and carry out adequate risk mitigation measures, thereby managing the core risk factors and carrying out safety management through continuous SMS.
Stronger Aviation Security in Accordance with Changes in the Airline Industry. 
The importance of aviation security is growing with the recent increase in air cargo demand, the introduction of ID verification through biometrics, and the risks posed by drones. Accordingly, there are calls for the establishment of aviation security measures and emphasizing the importance of a culture that promotes security. In an effort to continuously strengthen its aviation security compliance, Korean Air conducts a regular risk assessment every month, based on the information collected from domestic and overseas sites, as well as via various other channels. Korean Air stresses the importance of each site taking adequate security measures that fit its aviation security level. Furthermore, we provide training sessions on aviation security for security staff members at home and abroad on a regular basis. Korean Air will monitor international security trends and take prompt action by actively participating in international organizations including IATA SAC (Security Advisory Council) and SkyTeam ASG (Aviation Security Group), while at the same time sparing no efforts to establish an operating system for preventative aviation security.

Systematic Operation of a Company-wide Safety Management System. 
Korean Air, with the Corporate Aviation Safety & Security Department at its center, has established a company-wide SMS system in all areas of operation, and in all domestic and international service contact points, and thereby manages an efficient and systematic safety management system. In particular, through the integrated change management procedure established in 2019, in order to identify internal and external risk factors in advance and strengthen the safety management system, we are preemptively managing safety issues in preparation for the post-coronavirus era. We have also been closely monitoring a total of 32 issues underway including management of safety issues (such as the construction of a new airport and the introduction of new aircraft) and integrated safety program for the integration with Asiana Airlines.
Development of a new safety management IT system. 
Korean Air is developing a new company-wide safety management system for more efficient safety management, in preparation for changes in domestic and international safety management requirements and the merger and acquisition of Asiana Airlines. It collects and analyzes aviation safety data derived from accident investigation, flight data analysis, and aviation safety reporting - to ensure systematic and data-based safety management that handles the entire safety management process including the recognition and evaluation of risk factors, along with the monitoring of risk mitigation measures.
Strengthening cargo transportation management. 
Korean Air has achieved safety goals composed of indicators provided internally and those provided externally by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport for four consecutive years. This was made possible by systematic safety management of our cargo transportation sites. In 2021, we conducted a monthly onsite safety inspection at airports operated by cargo planes and cargo-only planes and were able to preemptively discover 170 safety risk factors and control them in advance. Even in a limited environment brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, we are conducting contactless quality audits at overseas branches in order to provide a comprehensive diagnosis of the overall status of our transport operation and enhance the quality management of the entire process. As a result, in 2021, we obtained evaluation results above the international standard in terms of cargo transportation from international safety evaluation agencies (IOSA, DOD).

Stronger Company-wide Occupational Safety and Health Management System. 
Korean Air has strengthened its occupational safety and health management system in compliance with the Serious Accidents Punishment Act passed in January 2022 to protect the lives and safety of not only employees, but also citizens and customers. We have also appointed a new Chief Safety & Operating Officer (CSO) to be responsible for the company’s safety and health management, and established the Occupational Safety & Health Department that reports to the CSO and performs company-wide health and safety tasks and inspections.
In addition, we have appointed safety and health managers in major areas including aircraft maintenance, passenger transport, cargo transport, cabin management, and aerospace - as well as additional managers in charge of safety and health respectively, thus establishing a new disaster prevention centered occupational safety and health management system.
Korean Air abides by the rules and obligations stipulated in regulations related to health and safety including "Occupational Safety and Health;" and operates the Occupational Safety and Health Committee, which is comprised of the management and the workers’ representatives, on a quarterly basis to debate and decide on important matters related to workplace safety and health. We also do our best to manage the safety and health of citizens in accordance with "Occupational Safety and Health," to ensure that passengers enjoy safe flights. In 2021, we conducted a special safety inspection of all of our facilities, identified risk factors and made improvements, and we have made various efforts to prevent disasters that can happen to employees and citizens.
Risk Assessment System. 
Korean Air conducts annual and ad-hoc risk assessments in accordance with Article 36 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act on all employees and contractors of the business sites where accidents may happen to identify, replace, and control risk factors. The risk assessment system, introduced in 2008 to create a safe workplace environment, evaluates various risk factors that can lead to injuries and diseases, to establish measures to reduce risks to an acceptable level. An evaluation team is organized for each business division during the risk assessment to identify risk factors for each site in depth and put in place improvement measures. In addition, Korean Air effectively manages the risk factors in a systematic manner by testing the effectiveness of the risk-reduction measures on a regular basis and following up on the completion status.

Customer Satisfaction. 
Active Establishment of a Consumer Centered Management (CCM) System. 
Korean Air became the first airline to acquire the Consumer Centered Management (CCM) certification of the Fair Trade Commission operated by the Korea Consumer Agency. The CCM certification is a national statutory certification based on the Consumer Basic Act, and it is awarded to companies that perform customer centered business activities and continue to make improvements. Korean Air acquired the CCM certification in recognition of its continued efforts to improve consumer convenience across all business sectors based on the management philosophy of “Service Excellence,” and implementation of social contribution activities through global public service projects.
After acquisition of the CCM certification, Korean Air has set up a dedicated team for establishment of the CCM system and has implemented a variety of activities, including operation of a Service Improvement Committee to practice consumercentered management and introduction of NPS (Net Promoter Score) to realize consumer-centered service improvement by listening to the different voices of consumers.
Korean Air will continue to carry out active consumer-centered management activities and build a CCM-based culture to bring more convenience to air travel consumers and improve consumer welfare.
Amid changes in the business environment of a number of companies including airlines due to the pandemic, there is growing importance of service excellence and winning back the hearts of our customers. Numerous companies have strengthened their competitiveness despite the challenging business environment by providing products or services that exceed customers’ expectations. With customers demanding and expecting more from airlines due to technological advancements and diversity of customer experience, companies are taking a multi-faceted approach to delight and satisfy customers. 
BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT. 
Under the business philosophy of “Service Excellence,” Korean Air considers customer satisfaction as the highest priority. After becoming the first airline to acquire Consumer Centered Management (CCM) certification, we have continued to carry out customer centered management activities to build a CCM culture. We also practice service excellence by actively reflecting the opinions received through the Voice of Customer (VOC) channel and improving services. We communicate with customers through social media and various marketing activities, and will commit to improving customer services by continuing to invest in customer communication.

Operation of Voice of Customer (VOC)
In accordance with our management approach, we improve our services by reflecting opinions received from customers, and utilize “Voice of Customer” as a means to manage customer contact points and understand service trends. As such, Korean Air will continue to prioritize customer satisfaction and safety, and achieve innovation of services in accordance with changes in customer demand.
Service improvement by reflecting VOC. 
Full-scale digitalization of travel documents (e-Document System) Korean Air has become the first airline in the world to launch an e-Document System, introducing full-scale digitalization of 23 types of travel documents passengers previously had to fill out by hand. Accordingly, passengers are now able to use their digital devices to fill out documents, including pet transportation declaration forms, unaccompanied minor application forms, and the health condition declaration forms anywhere and anytime they want. Customers’ reservation information is automatically reflected in the system when the documents are filled in, and the documents can be viewed in real time from branches located at home and abroad. As a result, customers experience a significantly higher level of convenience, as the new service reduces customer wait time, and the contact information and e-mail addresses recorded in the documents are automatically updated to Skypass. In addition, customer data is automatically stored on a secure server and disposed of, which shows a stronger protection of personal information.
Expansion of Chatbot services In October of 2021, Korean Air introduced chatbot services that have until now been available only via mobile applications including Kakaotalk and Facebook Messenger to its website. Furthermore, we have upgraded the convenience of our customers from English-speaking countries by launching an English chatbot feature as of December 2021. The expansion of chatbot services has provided information on air travel to many more customers through a larger number of channels faster than ever.
Introduction of specialty coffee and diversification The growth of the global coffee market has made customers demand and expect more from in-flight coffee. To keep up with the trend, Korean Air has changed its coffee provider to the most popular coffee brands including illy and Starbucks, introduced iced coffee on flights, and improved the quality of the coffee beans used to serve coffee for economy class passengers. As such, we were able to provide a satisfying experience to our passengers by upgrading our in-flight coffee services and introducing a broader choice of products.
Overall restructuring of the system for managing lounge users Previously, a staff member had to let passengers into the lounge after checking their boarding passes and looking up their membership information on a separate system, which meant passengers had to wait for a certain amount of time. After the implementation of a new lounge operation management system in March 2021, scanning passengers’ boarding passes will automatically integrate their membership information in real time, which means they are able to enjoy the lounge without any waiting time. In addition, Korean Air uses an AWS-based big data analytics platform to forecast the demand for lounge usage by collecting and analyzing various variables that impact lounge use. Forecasting the demand helps enhance customer convenience as we prevent the lounge from becoming overly crowded and offer services that reflect customer preferences.
Service Excellence System. 
By implementing the “Service Excellence” system, Korean Air rewards employees who contribute to customer satisfaction with their excellent service skills, thereby encouraging employees to provide customers with superior services. Over 450 employees have received prize money and a gold badge as a reward since the system was first introduced in 2005. The rewards are intended for employees to take pride in their contributions to enhancing the service level of Korean Air and to share award-winning cases to set an example for the other employees.
New Opportunities to Use Miles. 
Korean Air is offering passengers more opportunities to use miles easily. Besides the typical ways of using miles, which is to purchase award tickets and upgrade seats, passengers are now able to use their miles for a variety of services and products, including to book a hotel and purchase a restaurant voucher, logo-inspired product, or an admission ticket. Cash and Miles, a combined payment system that was introduced in January 2021 allows customers to use 500 miles at a minimum when they purchase flight tickets, and thus is garnering much interest from passengers who want to use small value miles. Through the partnership formed with Naver in July 2021, customers can use their miles for Naver Plus membership and enjoy a number of shopping advantages and digital content. Customers can also use their miles to receive a discount on the items they want to purchase at E-mart through the partnership between the two companies introduced in January 2022.

NPS Customer Survey. 
Korean Air became the first airline in Korea to introduce the Net Promoter Score (NPS) customer survey in January 2021. Underscoring the importance of customercentered management, Korean Air has created a team dedicated to survey management, which was once operated by a Task Force team, to better collect feedback and listen to the voice of customers. The survey asks questions such as, “Would you recommend Korean Air to others?”─ and Korean Air uses the feedback collected to come up with solutions to improve services by creating a database for feedback received and sharing it through the in-house NPS dashboard. In preparation for the post-COVID-19 era, Korean Air will continue to strengthen communication with customers through NPS to improve services.
Advanced Customer Services Enabled through Digital Innovation. 
Three years since Korean Air announced its plan for cloud migration in 2018, it successfully completed migrating all of its IT systems to the cloud for the first time among large conglomerates in Korea and large airlines around the world. As a result, Korean Air is now capable of using the cloud to enhance efficiency and drive service innovation faster than ever.
Data analytics and machine learning, both features provided by the cloud, will help Korean Air innovate its business processes, promote passenger services, enhance efficiency and convenience of the reservation and ticketing system, and improve punctuality by promoting the accuracy of weather forecasts. Customers are now able to use the mobile application introduced in early 2021 to purchase flight tickets more conveniently; and the customer data platform in the cloud environment is expected to be capable of offering customized customer information, by providing unique digital identification information according to customers' characteristics.
In addition, to ensure continuity of its global services despite disasters that could occur domestically, Korean Air has set up multiple data centers in Korea, and an overseas disaster recovery center. Starting with migration to the cloud, Korean Air has accelerated innovation in an era of digital innovation, and at the same time, is developing futuristic groundbreaking services that bring convenience and satisfaction to customers around the world.

Communication through Customer Marketing Activities. 
Korean Air transports masterpieces of Picasso to a special exhibition in Korea in celebration of the 140th anniversary of the artist’s birth. 
Korean Air promotes the brand value through a number of marketing activities. As part of its arts & culture sponsorship program, Korean Air has helped display Picasso’s artworks in the “Pablo Picasso Retrospective,” one of the major exhibitions of 2021. The special exhibition, which began at Seoul Arts Center in May 2021, ended in success four months later. Korean Air successfully completed its mission to transport to Korea 110 artworks of Picasso from the National Picasso Museum in Paris. Air transport of artwork has garnered much interest, and has become a brand marketing opportunity to promote Korean Air to exhibition visitors.
Enhancing global awareness through sports marketing activities. 
Korean Air makes every effort to use active sports marketing activities as a means to promote brand awareness among customers. Korean Air also has been operating the Excellence Program from 2006, through which it sponsors people who have raised Korea’s national status and awareness in culture and sports. The airline especially sponsors Park Sung-hyun, and Ko Jin-young, professional golf players playing on the LPGA circuit, thereby promoting the airline's brand name around the globe. In addition, we also sponsor Jack Aitken (Han Se-yong), who has attracted attention in Korea and abroad as the first British-Korean racing driver to compete in the F1 race as a member of the F1 Williams Racing Team.
Customer-engaging Travel Photo Contest. 
Korean Air held the 27th Annual Travel Photo contest in 2021. Photos that showcase memorable moments customers have experienced and cherished and make others want to travel should be submitted to the General section, and pictures of happy daily lives that have helped them get through COVID-19 and life without travel to the Special section. Korean Air continues to actively communicate with customers through photo exhibitions to share previous memories of traveling even in a situation where air travel is restricted due to COVID.
MOU Signed between Korean Air and the Korea Tourism Organization (KTO) to Strengthen the Tourism Industry. 
On December 17, 2021, Korean Air signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for cooperation on the development of the national tourism industry. The agreement signed will bring together the capabilities and resources of the two companies to attract foreign tourists. Korean Air’s global network and differentiated customer services will meet the KTO’s travel know-how and quality content to create synergy. The partnership between the two companies will bring more international tourists to Korea, and significantly revitalize the slumped domestic tourism industry, heavily hit by COVID-19. In accordance with the agreement, Korean Air plans to carry out various marketing activities that foreign customers find interesting, using data coming from KTO’s foreign language website. The airline will also encourage foreign travelers to visit Korea by displaying content on traveling in Korea and tourist attractions recommended by the KTO in the SKYPASS newsletter, the official social media channel, and Morning Calm, our in-flight magazine. Furthermore, “Feel the Rhythm of Korea,” a viral video developed by the Korea Tourism Organization to promote trips to Korea, was played as an in-flight AVOD by Korean Air. Korean Air and the KTO will work together to produce advertisements and content that promote Korea’s national brand, jointly participate in offline travel expos, and jointly develop new flight routes.

Sustainable supply chain management. 
As of 2021, Korean Air’s aerospace business division procures parts and materials required to manufacture aircraft from its global supply chain consisting of 442 partners from 19 countries around the world. We continue to seek shared growth with our suppliers by implementing various programs for mutual cooperation and growth, joint development projects, and helping them attract government projects to establish a sustainable supply chain and secure the business stability of suppliers.
Production system based on hybrid drones. 
Korean Air has shown tangible results by partnering with suppliers in the development and manufacturing of unmanned aircraft systems, a cutting-edge technology intensive area. The hybrid drones with a hybrid battery and combustion propulsion system developed exclusively by Korean Air are suitable for various public operations and works. By signing an agreement with suppliers to create a hybrid-drone-based production system, Korean Air was able to supply its aircraft to the Defense Acquisition Program Administration and Jeju Fire Safety Headquarters. As a leading UAV System Integration company in Korea, Korean Air will continue to maintain and cultivate healthy partnerships with partner companies to further strengthen the drone industry ecosystem.
Cooperation in cutting-edge aerospace technology. 
With technical skills accumulated from various development projects for satellites and Space Launch Vehicles, including satellites Mugunghwa and Arirang and the Naro space rocket, Korean Air formed a consortium with partners to participate in the Ministry of Science and ICT’s “Space Pioneer Project” and has started to jointly develop common bulkhead propellant tanks for small satellite launch vehicles. Common bulkhead propellant tanks developed using state-of-the-art welding and insulation technology simplify structures and lower the cost of production, and are expected to play a key role in promoting the competitiveness of domestic small launch vehicles.
Korean Air will spare no efforts to ensure that the development project ends in success based on strong communication and trust with partner companies.

Social Contribution. 
Korean Air promotes the value of sharing with local communities and the global village based on its responsibilities as a global airline. However, the restrictions imposed on face-to-face activities due to the spread of COVID-19 raised difficulties for the social contribution activities Korean Air has implemented so far. During 2021, we carried out our annual events, including employee fundraising and rice donation, and have resumed our travel photo contest and sisterhood activities in rural villages that were once stopped due to the pandemic.
When COVID-19 subsides, Korean Air will resume its social contribution activities and realize the value of sharing across the world with new active sharing programs that befit the post-COVID-19 era.

In the past, companies viewed employees as resources, meaning that employees following instructions from managers well were considered the best talents. However, companies have recently started to practice talent management, viewing employees as active players with a desire for growth and advancement and the growth engine of the company. There is a growing emphasis on the importance of promoting employees’ competitiveness and satisfaction level, including improving individual capabilities and expertise, appropriate compensation following fair evaluation, and a balance between work and life.
Business Environment. 
Korean Air was founded based on the management philosophy of “A company is the sum of its people.” As such, Korean Air views people as the driving force behind its growth. Based on this belief, we pursue HR policies that respect diversity and a variety of welfare programs that promote work and life balance. We also strive to build a flexible organizational culture by diversifying communication channels with employees and operate a systematic talent-development program to foster the capabilities of individuals.

Maternity Protection System. 
Korean Air has continued to elevate the status of women by steadily increasing the number of women hired and promoting maternity protection policies. According to our maternity protection system, female employees can take maternity leave before and after childbirth, take time off to take care of children or family, and use a reduced work-hour system, all in compliance with the legal standards. Our maternity protection system offers more than the legal standards, to include allowing all female employees to take infertility leave and maternity leave for female flight attendants from the day they become aware of their pregnancy.
Furthermore, Korean Air also offers long-term/short-term voluntary leave for selfdevelopment and family care to all employees; and employees who need to adjust their working hours due to reasons including childcare, etc. can use the flexible working system. Korean Air aims to enable work and life balance by introducing a remote working system and work-from-home measures, and promotes a flexible workplace environment.

Fair Evaluation・Compensation System. 
Multi-faceted evaluation system. 
All employees are evaluated based on fair standards for their contribution to the organization and their competency. Korean Air consists of employees of various occupations, and accordingly operates a multi-faceted evaluation system. Standardized work performance reports are used for field departments performing standardized tasks, whereas flight crews are evaluated based on the nature of their work, including flight operation skills for a certain aircraft or region and ability to perform emergency procedures in urgent situations. The evaluation results are incorporated into the salaries and decisions for promotion for each job-type and position.
Fair Compensation System. 
Korean Air’s HR management system, which is non-discriminatory and transparent, is based on a fair evaluation system that evaluates employees for their performance and competence. The airline provides equal treatment for both full-time and temporary employees, including basic salary, performance-based incentives, and safety subsidies. Other benefits provided regardless of employment type include discount flight tickets, which is a representative welfare benefit package, congratulations and condolences allowance, medical support, and condominium use.
Welfare System. 
Korean Air offers the highest level of salary and welfare among companies in the airline industry to improve employees’ quality of life.

Under the education policy of “fostering global talents based on expertise,” Korean Air operates a training system that provides systematic training by job position/ job type based on two competency models: management competency; and job competency. The human resources management headquarters is responsible for efficient operation of training, by establishing and executing education policies and a company-wide common training course.

Flexible online/offline education in response to external factors. 
The prolongation of the pandemic has imposed restrictions on carrying out planned training throughout 2021. However, Korean Air utilized IT systems including Google Meet to provide new hire orientation sessions, training for overseas manager candidates, and other statutory training courses online. We will flexibly respond to external factors in 2022, including COVID-19 and the government’s quarantine guidelines, and carry out both online and offline training activities. However, in the event that the pandemic subsides in 2022 due to increased vaccination rates and treatment development, the airline is expected to expand planned training courses including sessions for team/group leaders.
Training overseas local hires. 
We have developed and are operating an overseas local employee training system in order to cultivate global talents who can contribute to establishing the foundation for overseas localization. Representative courses include our “Excellence Employee Program,” which is designed to enhance understanding of our business and Korean culture, “Company Orientation” for new foreign flight attendants and cabin crew, and the “English Instructor Training Course” to nurture local instructors. In addition, under instruction of the branch manager, new hires of the European/Southeast Asia regions are required to take the New Employee Orientation course either online or offline. The course helps prepare the new hires as new members of Korean Air.
We have added real-time remote classes by business area/region to meet the growing demand for training regarding passenger/cargo basic/maintenance following COVID-19- induced changes in the number of employees working at overseas business sites. Through close interaction and communication between the Service Academy of the headquarters’ Human Resources Development Center and overseas branches, Korean Air provides timely services to promote the quality of local employees’ services. We are expanding our real-time remote training courses for overseas employees to overcome the restrictions in training and education caused by COVID-19. We are also providing more service education opportunities by regularly producing and distributing self-learning content and online training courses to enable repetitive learning and easier access to education for employees abroad.
Lifelong learning and retiree assistance program. 
Korean Air operates Jungseok College, Korea’s first in-house tech school, and supports lifelong learning of employees by providing full scholarships to all students. Jungseok College was founded in 2000 to nurture talents who will play a pivotal role in the aviation and logistics industries based on the combination of rich hands-on experience and academic theories. Since the school opened in 2000, a total of 1,479 degrees have been awarded a total of 21 times, including 1,038 bachelor’s degrees and 441 associate degrees. Jungseok College is becoming a platform for nurturing future-oriented intellectuals by providing employees opportunities to be creative and pursue self-development, and allowing employees to engage in lifelong learning.
Furthermore, Korean Air provides scholarships to employees continuing studies in the Graduate School of Aviation and Management of Korea Aerospace University and the MBA program for logistics at Inha University. We provide 10% of the tuition fee as scholarship to encourage employees’ continuous self-development and to nurture talents in the aviation and logistics field. Through these efforts, we promote employees’ motivation to learn and desire for lifelong learning. Korean Air is currently operating a post-retirement program to support employees reaching retirement age. The program includes courses on post-retirement time management, life/career design, individual financial situation, and asset management.

Organizational Culture Based on Trust and Communication. 
Operation of a proposal board. 
In January 2021, Korean Air introduced “Idea#,” an in-house online bulletin board, where employees can freely share their ideas and create a productive work environment. Idea# is a company-wide platform that consolidates all of the suggestion systems that were implemented separately for the headquarters and each business division. Employees are able to share opinions without limitation on topics, regardless of their team and organization, and all employees are free to give constructive feedback and share their own thoughts. Relevant teams would thoroughly review the opinions posted, and any opinions that are selected receive awards. Every day, 510 employees visit the bulletin board on average and share their opinions on their colleagues’ ideas. In-house contests are held for certain themes and topics that require collective intelligence.
A large number of employees have already shown their enthusiasm for themes including ESG and CCM by taking part in in-house idea contests, and we have also developed features to increase participation in surveys and polls. Idea# is quickly becoming a representative channel for in-house communication and contributing to improved productivity by encouraging employee participation.
Stronger Together campaign. 
Korean Air is conducting a company-wide innovation campaign first launched in 2020, titled “Stronger Together,” to build a dynamic and forward-looking organizational culture. The objective of the campaign is to prepare for the postCOVID-19 era and strengthen the competitiveness of the airline, by improving the organizational structure and ways of doing business and communication. The organizational structure was partially reformed to enhance manpower efficiency and eliminate inefficiencies that hinder fast decisions. We also redefined the roles and responsibilities of each team to eliminate gray areas.
By sharing department and team objectives, Korean Air set a clear direction for each department, improved employees’ understanding of other teams, and built the basis for cooperation between teams. Furthermore, Korean Air launched an awareness improvement campaign, under which employees can lead changes in the way work is done. We post 10 critical themes, including meetings, reporting, and communication on the company-wide news bulletin board and in-house display to encourage employees’ voluntary efforts to make changes. In addition, we have replaced complicated documentation requirements with emails to eliminate unnecessary procedures and inefficiencies, and simplified processes across the company. We have also established a standard terminology system to systematically manage expert knowledge in aviation. Using the system and standardization of work, we further strengthen communication among employees and expertise in the aviation field.
Based on respect for diversity and a transparent culture of communication, Korean Air will continue to implement the Stronger Together campaign to create a flexible organizational culture capable of responding to the fast-changing environment.
Communication plaza. 
Korean Air operates the “communication plaza” bulletin board on the airline’s website for employees to improve organizational culture based on flexible communication and mutual trust. The communication plaza is an online bulletin board that employees use as a constructive platform for communication to anonymously submit questions, and send complimentary and encouraging messages to each other. By strictly protecting anonymity, employees are free to share ideas without limitation to topics. Departments in charge swiftly respond to inquiries and requests submitted by employees and take relevant measures, which leads to vitalization of in-house communication and substantial improvement of the organizational culture.
Korean Air launches “Daehan TV,” an in-house broadcasting YouTube channel. 
In June 2021, Korean Air launched Daehan TV, its in-house YouTube channel.

Sound Governance. 
Board of Directors. 
Korean Air’s Board of Directors consists of three executive directors with rich industry experience and nine independent directors with diverse backgrounds in finance/economics, law, governance, and ESG. Independent director candidates are nominated by the Independent Director Recommendation Committee and are appointed by a resolution of the general shareholders’ meeting. In this procedure, shareholders with certain qualifications can nominate independent director candidates in accordance with prescribed procedures. Profiles of independent directors and candidates are disclosed on the DART website prior to the general meeting of shareholders.
Independence of the BOD. 
In March 2020, Korean Air made amendments to its Articles of Association to appoint different persons as the CEO and the chairman of the BOD; and appointed Jeong Kap-Young as the new chairman, thereby strengthening the independence of the Board of Directors. A total of three independent directors were appointed at the 2021 general shareholders’ meeting considering the independence and objectivity of the BOD. The directors appointed include Kim Se-Jin, an expert on corporate management and economy; Jang Yong-Sung, a finance specialist; and Lee JaeMin, a legal expert. The percentage of independent directors increased from 67% to 75%, which reinforced the independence and management transparency of the BOD. Furthermore, four committees (Independent Director Recommendation Committee, Audit Committee, ESG Committee, and the Compensation Committee) except for the Safety Committee that requires in-house safety specialists, all consist of independent directors, which promote the independence and objectivity of the Board of Directors.
BOD’s expertise and diversity. 
Korean Air focuses on expertise and diversity in the Board of Directors to drive balanced decisions based on a broader perspective. The Independent Director Recommendation Committee, which is made up of independent directors, nominates candidates with expertise and a high social reputation that can contribute to achieving the company’s overall direction and objective. The independent directors are appointed by a resolution of the general meeting of shareholders. The airline’s Board of Directors is currently composed of highly professional and prestigious professionals from various fields, including management, finance, corporate governance, and law.
BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT. 
In accordance with recognition of the growing importance of establishing sound governance structures for global investment - and more demand for an advanced governance system from home and abroad - establishment of a sound governance structure has become the backbone of a company’s sustainable growth. Recently, the importance of the roles and responsibilities of the Board of Directors on not only financial performance, but also non-financial factors, including ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) has grown. More emphasis is being put on the independence, expertise, and diversity of the directors.

In order to fulfill corporate social responsibilities to stakeholders, Korean Air has set “establishment of a sustainable governance structure” as its main mission, and is striving to internalize ESG management and introduce an advanced Board of Directors-centered governance structure. In 2021, Korean Air established the ESG Committee under the Board of Directors to lead ESG activities and introduced a systematic ESG management system. In addition, we have incorporated our respect for diversity by making revisions and changes to the Corporate Governance Charter, which serves as the backbone for corporate governance structure. Understanding that a sound corporate governance structure contributes to customers, employees, various stakeholders, and even the society, Korean Air will continue to make efforts to achieve sustainability management centered on the Board of Directors.

In addition, the BOD achieved gender diversity by appointing the first female independent director in 2020, and has reflected various values in the Corporate Governance Structure Charter in 2021 to ensure that directors are not discriminated against due to factors such as gender, age, region, ethnicity, religion, and disability. Korean Air will continue to reinforce the expertise and diversity within the Board of Directors to accomplish advanced management led by the BOD.
BOD Achievements. 
Throughout the year 2021, Korean Air held a total of nine board meetings, including seven regular meetings and two extraordinary meetings, to vote on a total of 49 agenda items.

Through a range of channels, including business reports, semi-annual and quarterly reports, Corporate Governance Report, IR information on the website, general shareholders’ meetings, IR sessions, and the DART system, Korean Air shares and communicates on major business issues with stakeholders and shareholders swiftly and receives their feedback. The ESG report, which serves as the main channel of communication with stakeholders, is published with the approval of the heads of each division, the vice president, and the president.
Value of Diversity in the Corporate Governance Charter. 
Korean Air reflected its respect for diversity into the Corporate Governance Charter, the backbone of its corporate governance structure, by making partial revisions and amendments to it in December 2021. The Charter stipulates matters pertaining to shareholders’ rights, the roles and responsibilities of the BOD, operations of auditing bodies, and protection of stakeholders’ rights. Korean Air has strived to further improve the governance structure after first enacting the Corporate Governance Charter in November 2019.
To follow the global trend of governance structure and pursue diversity, Korean Air appointed a female independent director in March 2020, and announced in June that the company would take part in IATA 25 by 2025*, an IATA-led campaign, to promote diversity and inclusiveness in the aviation industry. In addition, the airline has stipulated respect for diversity at the board-level in Article 5(④) of Chapter 2 of the Corporate Governance Charter in December.

Compliance Activities. 
Compliance management. 
Korean Air appointed "compliance management specialists" in over 20 different areas at home and abroad, and published the Legal Risk Management Guidebook that prescribes the respective governing laws and matters to be attended to. Employees from each division are required to complete the company’s training course to prevent potential legal risks that may arise related to work.
Compliance Officer’s compliance review report. 
For compliance management, Korean Air monitors transactions with subsidiaries pursuant to Fair Trade Act, and performs legal reviews on transactions exceeding KRW 1 billion on a quarterly basis, before preparing a compliance review report signed by the Compliance Officer.
Compliance response. 
Upon enforcement of a new decree, Korean Air not only shares with all employees and notifies them of the legal issues relevant to the company, but also establishes a new system or improves existing work processes, and performs self-inspection to review whether the new system is functioning as intended. The company has created a manual to follow in case a security accident or issue that is in violation of the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) of the EU arises, and has conducted a drill to prepare for website-related personal information leakage. We also perform reviews on compliance standards and the adequacy of compliance levels, including confirmation of a checklist related to the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015, and statement disclosure, maintenance of systems related to the Serious Accidents Punishment Act (SAPA), and preparation for the China Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL), on a regular basis.
Strengthening Ethical and Compliance Management Training. 
Through a variety of systematic ethical management/compliance training programs, Korean Air helps employees acquire, practice, and comply with principles and codes related to ethical management and compliance.
Every other year, employees at home and abroad are required to complete the “Our Ethical Management“ course, an online training course provided for each business area, which is about the importance of ethical management activities and corporate philosophy. The employees are required to pledge their compliance with the responsibilities and obligations stated in the company’s ethical management guidelines.
Korean Air strives to promote employees’ compliance awareness by conducting training on the Improper Solicitation and Graft Act and Fair Trade Act for new hires and employees hired overseas. The airline also requires employees to complete courses on Compliance with Antitrust Laws, Understanding the Improper Solicitation and Graft Act, and Understanding of the Abuse of Market Dominance and Unfair Trading Practices. Furthermore, Korean Air also strengthens employees’ compliance management responsibilities by publishing the Compliance Newsletter every quarter.
Ethical and compliance management training for employees 1) Conducted every other year for all employees, when training new hires, and as an open course 2) Conducted every year for domestic and overseas sales personnel (Decrease in the number of employees due to the COVID-19 closure) 3) Scheduled to be implemented in 2022 as a biennial course, but postponed to 2021 due to the closure caused by COVID-19.

Risk Management. 
Non-Financial Risks. 
Strategic and operational risks. 
A high-level consultative body composed of heads of business divisions is convened to review and discuss economic, environmental, and social trends from a company-wide perspective, as a means to maximize corporate value. In addition, internal audits are conducted to evaluate the risk-level of each business division and review the efficient use of resources.
Regulatory risks. 
Korean Air established a monitoring system to ensure compliance with relevant laws and regulations, and actively responds to regulatory risks by using various resources including the legal department and legal advisors. Moreover, the Compliance Program is implemented to prevent the possibility of unfair transactions.
Accident-related risks. 
The Corporate Aviation Safety & Security Department was established to oversee all matters related to safety and security, including preventing aircraft accidents and hijacking, and minimizing losses. Regulations, manuals, and guidelines on emergency and accident responses are published and the emergency-response system is inspected, while company-wide drills and training are conducted at least once per year to enhance the airline’s ability to respond to unexpected aircraft accidents.
Environmental risks. 
The company makes a lot of efforts to minimize environmental risks, including a company-wide initiative to prevent environmental risks, establishment of rules on environmental accident/crisis responses, and drills on potential oil and chemical leakages caused as a result of emergency response drills. To hedge against ground pollution emergencies, Korean Air conducts emergency response drills for each department as a means to prevent risks associated with environmental accidents. Furthermore, the adoption of high-efficiency aircraft and the development of short-cut routes are some of the actions taken by Korean Air to minimize the negative impacts of climate change on the environment.
Financial Risks. 
Korean Air established and operates a separate team to manage financial risks under the Finance Planning Team of the Corporate Finance Division. The team performs systematic risk management activities including monitoring risk factors in the market to minimize financial risks.
Exchange rate fluctuation risks. 
Korean Air is exposed to risks associated with exchange rate volatility because it deals with transactions in foreign currencies. The high percentage of foreign currency loans makes Korean Air’s profit/loss and cash flow vulnerable to fluctuations in the exchange rate. As a result, the airline aims to reduce the share of its dollar loans by diversifying the portfolio of borrowing currencies and expanding the borrowing of KRW based on a fixed rate as much as possible. Korean Air especially focuses on continuing to manage the exchange rate fluctuation risk through currency derivatives contracts. In addition, the airline’s Cash Management System helps monitor income and expenditures on a regular basis and maintain an adequate level of balance by currency, which minimizes negative impacts associated with exchange rate volatility.
Interest rate fluctuation risks. 
Korean Air’s borrowings are based on both fixed and variable interest rates, and floating rate loans affect the profit/ loss and cash flow of the company in accordance with fluctuations in the exchange rate. By closely monitoring current market interest rate levels and the monetary policies of major countries, Korean Air works to effectively manage risks related to interest rate fluctuations, through increasing the amount of fixed rate loans in surplus currencies with low interest rates (Yen, Euro, etc.) and interest rate swap agreements.
Oil price risks. 
The air transport industry is an industry in which oil prices account for a high percentage of the overall operating costs. Therefore, fluctuations in oil prices affect the profit/loss and cash flow of the company. Various factors, including crude oil production volume, demand forecasts, crude oil inventories, and speculative demand in the commodity market play a huge role in the fluctuation of market prices for petroleum products, such as jet fuel. The average amount of jet fuel consumption of Korean Air for the past five years was approximately 28 million barrels, so the airline is managing oil price risks through introduction of new fuel-efficient aircraft and materials and oil derivatives.
Tax risks. 
In all its business operations, Korean Air’s priority is to comply with tax laws and regulations and to faithfully report and pay taxes. To that end, Korean Air collaborates with the internal tax organization and experts from inside and outside the company to conduct preliminary assessment of and follow up on tax risks that may occur in the process of major goods/services transactions, contract modifications, and initiation of new business projects. In addition, the airline contributed to the creation of tax revenue by paying various direct and indirect taxes through sales activities, investment, and employment.

Stakeholder Interviews. 
Korean Air conducted interviews with one person each from different stakeholder groups, including customers, employees, suppliers, and shareholders/investors, and listened to their opinions on major sustainability management issues. Matters discussed in the interviews include Korean Air’s strengths and weaknesses compared to domestic and international companies in similar industries; the latest sustainability management trends in terms of ESG; ways to promote Korean Air’s long-term corporate value; and strengthening sustainability management. Discussions with major stakeholders were incorporated into the Issue Pool, which is the foundation of the company’s materiality assessment.
Customers expect Korean Air to focus on fulfilling its social and environmental responsibilities as much as it works to introduce quality services. 
A company that engages in fair competition based on excellent management capabilities and quality service. 
Expecting Korean Air to overtime the COVID-19 crisis in a smart manner and to solidify its position as a leading ESG company. 
Look forward to seeing Korean Air achieve sustainable management by securing a strategic financial structure to respond to changes in external factors. 
As a person studying in France, I have flown Korean. 
Air’s international flights at least once per year since 2014. One of the reasons for flying Korean Air is because its services, including user-friendliness, air cabin cleanliness, and in-flight meals, are superior to that of other airlines. I was particularly impressed by how. 
Korean Air did its best for the safety and convenience of passengers amidst the pandemic during my flight to. 
Korea recently. Korean Air provides detailed easy-to- follow guidelines for customers on COVID-19 response channels and updated instructions on the overall course of departure and entry. As a person working in the fashion industry in France, I know for a fact that the latest trend in fashion is diversity (including in ethnicity and body shape). Korean Air needs to make efforts to pursue diversity accordingly. For example, intellectuals from various backgrounds with diverse experience should be recruited as flight attendants, promoting the company’s diversity. In addition, the disposable products frequently used on the plane should be replaced with eco-friendly items for environmental protection. Instead of stopping at mere attempts, Korean Air should strive to have its business operations and processes reflect sustainability and eco-friendliness.
The COVID-19 pandemic has posed an unprecedented crisis for the aviation industry. As increasing volatility in external factors is compounding the problem, establishment of a foundation for sustainable growth is becoming a major task. There are increasing calls for strategies for shared growth and coexistence with our suppliers as the small-and-medium sized companies partnering with the company have also faced extreme difficulties due to the market situation. Korean Air is carrying out a variety of activities for sustainable management despite the COVID-19 crisis. A systematic quarantine program is operated to prioritize safety and to offer services that keep customers safe from the coronavirus. We have recently improved our prevention and management system even further in order to strengthen our level of management over occupational health and safety. The company has also participated in efforts to respond to climate change and reduce carbon emissions, by continuing to adopt high-efficiency aircraft and materials and laying the foundation for introducing bio-jet fuel in Korea. I look forward to seeing Korean Air solidify its standing as an ESG leader, based on its continuous efforts to strengthen financial performance as well as create non-financial values.
Korea Airports Corporation provides services, including aircraft ground handling, unloading/loading of baggage, air cargo handling, and aircraft maintenance and repair for domestic airports including Incheon Airport, and is closely related to air transportation.
Korea Airports Corporation was able to show strong financial performance when a large number of airlines were financially struggling with travel restrictions imposed due to the pandemic. Despite this great news, the company still needs to drive innovation to develop new businesses, considering that the passenger transport business, a major business area, is still facing difficulties. In addition, the company should pay special attention to issues related to monopoly and oligopoly and pursue fair competition, taking into account that its size will grow even further with the acquisition of Asiana Airlines. With employees working in various job categories and occupations, human rights management has become especially important. It is said that the corporate culture of Korean Air improved significantly due to the company’s efforts to promote human rights management. I expect to see Korean. 
Air work to reduce its use of disposables by using eco-friendly items and materials in the cabin and facilities to fulfill its environmental responsibilities. Lastly, it is my sincere hope that Korean Air establishes itself as a company that leads sustainability management in the aviation industry based on these business and promotion activities.
I’ve been researching Korean Air for the last seven years since 2015 as an analyst in the air transport industry. Advantages of Korean Air include quality services provided to customers and the variety of its international flights. Through the launch of a new joint venture partnership with Delta Air. 
Lines, Korean Air fulfills its social responsibilities and is contributing to the establishment of Incheon. 
Airport and creation of jobs. In order to achieve successful sustainability management, the company would have to focus on minimizing financial risks associated with fluctuations in oil prices, interest rate, and exchange rate, all factors that commonly impact the aviation industry. Furthermore, Korean. 
Air needs to create sustainable growth to prepare for changes in consumers’ consumption patterns in the post-pandemic era. It is extremely important for the company to evenly distribute economic values created as a result of its business activities to relevant stakeholders, including employees, customers, and shareholders. Companies that have gained trust from stakeholders can further develop and advance sustainable management activities. Large airlines in the United States and. 
Lion Air were able to successfully achieve sustainability management and create a virtuous circle by securing stable growth and profit in the merger and acquisition processes and by prioritizing dividend payment to shareholders. As a company with great potential, I look forward to seeing. 
Korean Air achieve and demonstrate sustainability management. Kang Eun-Kyung (Customer) __ CEO of Exercise0.

Opinions and Recommendations [Performance /Issues] We present the following recommendations to help Korean Air establish a company-wide sustainability management strategy, and respond to continuous issues of sustainability:
Economy. 
Despite a significant decrease in global travel due to the impact of COVID-19, Korean Air achieved a record-high operating profit in 2021 by undertaking efforts to maximize profitability in the cargo transportation business and reducing company- wide expenses. Korean Air’s excellent performance is being recognized by high-profile ESG (Environmental, Social, and. 
Governance) assessors at home and abroad. In July 2021, Korean Air issued bonds for the first time as a domestic airline, which reflects the company's continuous efforts to implement ESG management. To be able to lead the global aviation market and preemptively respond to the anticipated expansion of passenger demand in the post-COVID-19 era, we recommend that. 
Korean Air continues to improve its overall responsiveness to changes in the global business environment.
Environment. 
Korean Air has not stopped publishing ESG reports during the COVID-19 pandemic, and has continued environmental management, including climate response. The continued publication of the report and efforts to respond to the climate crisis are noteworthy achievements in terms of corporate sustainability. In particular, continuous waste-reduction efforts and introduction of new high-efficiency aircraft set a good example in the environmental field. As we enter a new era after the pandemic, air travel is expected to pick up again, which in turn will inevitably increase greenhouse gas emissions. With the growing awareness of the climate crisis, it is recommended that Korean Air sets measurable targets for climate response and establishes implementation strategies to be able to generate organizational performance on key issues.
Society. 
Korean Air reflects upon the legislative purposes of the Serious Accidents Punishment Act (SAPA) that came into effect in. 
January 2022, and endeavors to protect the safety of employees, as well as business partners, customers, and citizens, by expanding the scope of application of the occupational safety and health management system for risk management. Risks are managed in three categories: aviation security; industrial safety; and aviation safety. Every month, employees (including contractors) who are in key positions at Korean Air participate in risk assessment to identify and mitigate/remediate risks. For the past two years, Korean Air has engaged in various initiatives such as separation of the CEO and BOD chairman positions, appointment of female directors, and establishment of the ESG subcommittee, to improve its governance. In 2021, Korea. 
Air amended the corporate governance charter to emphasize the value of diversity and launched the ESG secretariat under the BOD to strengthen sustainability management. We hope that the ESG secretariat facilitates implementation of the ESG agenda discussed at the BOD and creates ESG values in cooperation with related departments.
The Korean Standards Association (KSA), established as a special corporation in accordance with the Law for Industrial Standardization in 1962, serves as a knowledge service provider that distributes and disseminates such services as industrial standardization, quality management, sustainability management, KS certification and ISO certification. The KSA is committed to the sustainable development of Korean society as an ISO 26000 national secretary, certified GRI training partner, AA1000 assurance provider, KSI (Korea Sustainability Index) operator, and UN CDM DOE (development operational entity), and as an assurance provider of the Korean government’s greenhouse gas energy target management system.
