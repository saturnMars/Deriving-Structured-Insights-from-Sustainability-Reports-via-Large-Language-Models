ABOUT THIS REPORT. 
This 2022 Environmental Social Governance Report (“Report”) is the fourth Environmental Social Governance (ESG) report issued by The Kraft Heinz Company (“Kraft Heinz” or “the Company”). This Report reflects our commitment to transparency and provides details for our stakeholders on progress to date against our ESG goals and objectives, which are based on our most significant ESG issues. These issues were reviewed and updated based on our ESG Materiality assessment.
This Report does not include details on our financial performance. Details on our financial performance can be found in our public filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and on our investor relations website. Materiality as used in this report, sometimes referenced as “ESG materiality,” and our ESG materiality review process, are intended to reflect priority ESG issues and do not have the same meaning as materiality under U.S. securities laws, in our filings with the SEC, or under similar laws in other jurisdictions. Issues deemed material for purposes of this Report and for purposes of determining our ESG strategies may not be considered material for other purposes, including our SEC or other reporting.
Unless otherwise noted, this Report covers initiatives and performance metrics associated with our global operations from January 1 through December 31, 2021. Kraft Heinz anticipates issuing an ESG Report annually.
We have utilized the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as a guiding framework in the development of our ESG initiatives. This Report also serves as our Communication on Progress as a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact and CEO Water Mandate.
Kraft Heinz supports the SDGs, which represent a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure prosperity for all. As such, we considered the SDGs when developing Kraft Heinz’s global ESG strategy and goals. The global ESG strategy of Kraft Heinz supports all 17 SDGs in varying degrees. We have identified the main places in this Report to demonstrate the key ways our initiatives work towards the targets aligned with the SDGs. This is represented by the appropriate icons preceding those correlating sections throughout the report.
This Report was prepared utilizing the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Sustainability Standard. We have also aligned this Report to the general principles of the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) for food and beverage companies, as well as the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD). Separate downloads of our ‘GRI’, ‘SASB’, and ‘TCFD’ disclosures are available on our website.
Kraft Heinz engaged with Bureau Veritas and SGS United Kingdom Ltd. to provide limited assurance in relation to specific 2021 environmental data. Details on our assurance activities are available in the appendix of this Report and on our website.

A LETTER FROM THE CEO. 
Anyone who knows me well knows how passionate I am about good food and cooking. For me, both are all about relationships. Preparing a meal and creating special moments with those I cook for are among my favorite things.
That’s why, as the CEO and Board Chair for a global food company with a delicious heritage, the work I do is so personal. I’m incredibly proud that our employees work each day to bring special moments to life for people across the globe. We at Kraft Heinz help feed the world through products that line store shelves and make their way to countless kitchens and restaurants. It all comes Together at the Table.
One of our Company Values is We do the right thing, and everything we do grows from there. But we can only drive progress and achieve our Environmental Social Governance goals by collaborating across our Company and with external stakeholders.
In fact, our 2022 ESG Report is a testament to the power of partnerships.
There is a saying that I love: “If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.” The concept of partnership and teamwork is essential – especially when it comes to our ESG efforts.
Within this Report, we’re proud to share the progress we are making when it comes to achieving our strategic ESG priorities – thanks in large measure to the alliances we’ve built. It’s all about bringing these internal and external groups together at the Kraft Heinz table. That means our customers and suppliers, nonprofit partners, and importantly, our dedicated employees across the globe.
That is what Together at the Table is all about.
At Kraft Heinz, we take a cross-functional approach to ESG, integrating socially responsible and sustainable practices throughout our business and value chain as we work to deliver on our goals by the year 2025. For us, ESG is not a nice-to-do; it is important to how we operate as a company and to the success of our long-term business strategy. Our ESG goals and priorities fall under three broad Pillars: Healthy Living & Community Support, Environmental Stewardship, and Responsible Sourcing. We believe in focusing on high-priority issues in areas that matter most – and where we as a company can make the greatest impact.
When it comes to ESG, we are on a long journey. While we celebrate the progress we are making toward our goals and Aspirations, we humbly acknowledge we have much work still to do. But despite these challenges, our teams have remained agile. They are working together to make real progress across our key metrics. And they are doing it all while prioritizing a more diverse and inclusive workplace.
This annual Report serves as our Communication on Progress as part of our commitments to the United Nations Global Compact and CEO Water Mandate. I encourage you to visit our ESG website, where you’ll find more about our ESG progress and highlights of our achievements, goals, and Aspirations.
I invite ALL of you to join us –to come Together at the Table – as we continue this journey of transforming our world for the better. There is room for all of us!

ESG Materiality* and Stakeholder Engagement. 
To inform and continuously improve upon our ESG strategy, we engage a wide variety of stakeholders for input. Participating in an ongoing, two-way dialogue with our stakeholders strengthens our understanding of important environmental, social and governance issues, which helps us set associated priorities to make respective impacts.
Our global stakeholder network includes both the internal and external people and parties whose support is important to the long-term success of our business, or who are materially impacted by our business operations. The table below lists these groups and summarizes our engagement activities with them.

APPENDIX ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP RESPONSIBLE SOURCING HEALTHY LIVING & COMMUNITY SUPPORT APPENDIX INTRODUCTION


ESG Materiality Assessment. 
To inform our ESG strategy and goal-setting, Kraft Heinz conducts a comprehensive ESG materiality assessment every three to five years, with respective smaller interim updates as appropriate. This assessment allows us to identify and prioritize the environmental, social and governance issues that are of greatest concern to our stakeholders and relevant to the success of our business. We reevaluate these results on an ongoing basis to reflect any substantial changes in standing on these priority issues and allow for the inclusion of new or emerging issues. We treat our ESG materiality matrix as a living assessment based on participant input. We continue to evaluate material ESG issues to our key stakeholders and the respective impact on our business operations across dynamic global markets. Material issues are monitored regularly by a variety of internal stakeholders including Kraft Heinz leadership, ESG and the Corporate and Government Affairs ESG Subcommittee.
In 2022, we updated our ESG materiality assessment using Datamaran’s cloud-based AI software platform. Datamaran’s patented technology provides our ESG Steering Committee with real-time data analysis to identify and monitor new or emerging issues that may impact Kraft Heinz, including regular insight into our Company’s unique strategic, regulatory, and reputational risks and opportunities. The assessment includes signals from across a variety of different sources, including corporate annual filings, mandatory regulations, voluntary policy initiatives, online news and media, as well as a cross-functional employee survey. Through this tech-enabled, dynamic and data-driven approach, we have strengthened our strategy and governance process to meet the rise of stakeholder demands at Kraft Heinz.
Enterprise Risk Management. 
Kraft Heinz has an established, comprehensive approach to Enterprise Risk Management (ERM). Annually, senior management evaluates changes and required updates to the top enterprise risks. The ERM process covers a broad spectrum of risks across several dimensions: ESG, strategic, financial, operational, legal and regulatory, human capital, and hazard/catastrophic. Senior management prioritizes the risks and develops the Kraft Heinz risk profile, which is shared with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors annually. Each risk owner provides regular updates to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.

In support of our Vision To sustainably grow by delighting more consumers globally, we are committed to responsible, sustainable practices extending to each facet of our business. The Kraft Heinz ESG strategy prioritizes the issues that matter most to the Company business and stakeholders, focusing on areas that have the greatest impact. It includes three key pillars: Healthy Living & Community Support, Environmental Stewardship and Responsible Sourcing.
Our goal is to build value among our Company’s broad set of stakeholders by incorporating socially responsible business practices within our own operations and across every stage of our supply chain. We’re setting ambitious environmental goals, sourcing sustainably, improving the products we sell and making impactful advancements in communities – all with a commitment to transparency and two-way dialogue. This continues to be our way forward.
ESG Strategy. 
Environmental Stewardship. 
Environmental stewardship begins with our operational footprint, where we actively strive to conserve water and energy, reduce emissions, minimize waste and make our packaging sustainable.
Our manufacturing sites can consume substantial amounts of resources, and are controlled by us, so we focus significant efforts around environmental stewardship inside of our walls.
Healthy Living & Community Support. 
A key part of our corporate strategy is a commitment to people, to nutrition and health, and to making life delicious all at once. Some of the actions we are taking to support this commitment include ongoing improvements to the nutrition of our product portfolio, transparent and responsible marketing and communications, and alignment with credible science and public health goals.
Through these actions, we aim to contribute to the key priorities and target achievements outlined by the World Health Organization’s. 
Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Noncommunicable Diseases, and the United. 
Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals.
Responsible. 
Sourcing. 
At Kraft Heinz, we not only believe in striving to be better every day within our own operations, but we aspire to work with our entire value chain to continually improve on social and environmental factors.
We are dedicated to responsible sourcing and related impacts in critical areas to Kraft Heinz and our stakeholders. These include areas of focus such as human rights, deforestation, animal welfare and sustainable agriculture. We are also committed to strengthening our due diligence and management programs, while keeping the needs of our suppliers and our customers a top priority.

Kraft Heinz has a diverse portfolio of products to suit a vast array of eating occasions and lifestyle choices. A key part of our corporate strategy is naturally a commitment to people, to nutrition and health, and to live our purpose ‘Let’s Make Life Delicious.’ Some of the actions we are taking to support this commitment include ongoing improvements to the nutrition of our product portfolio, transparent and responsible marketing and communications, and alignment with credible science and public health goals. Through these actions, we aim to contribute to the key priorities and target achievements outlined by the World Health Organization’s Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Noncommunicable Diseases, as well as several of the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We aim to promote responsible production and consumption as well as overall health and well-being. We are specifically targeting achievement of the SDG Zero Hunger through our partnership with organizations such as Rise Against Hunger, Heifer International and Feeding America, and through our operational food donation programs. Our communities are the foundation of our society, and reflect what’s best in us as we lean in and support their everyday needs. Moreover, during challenging times, whether from impacts from catastrophic weather events, social inequity unrest, or a devastating pandemic, Kraft Heinz strives to rise to the occasion and provide relief wherever we can.

Diversity, Inclusion, & Belonging. 
Corporate Highlights. 
At Kraft Heinz we choose to welcome everyone at our table. We choose to be inclusive because diverse backgrounds and perspectives make us stronger, more thoughtful, and more innovative. We believe that our Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging (DI&B) work helps us to walk in our Company Purpose: Let’s Make Life Delicious, and this will make a lasting impact for our employees and the marketplace for generations to come. That is why We demand diversity and commit to not only listening but to truly working to hear different points of view.
We aggregate these different points of view along with various data points in this space. Hence, data-driven plans continue to be established for our leaders to drive diversity, inclusion, and belonging in their teams. We have established strategies to ensure diverse hiring, retention, development, and advancement. We will continue to build upon our foundation of awareness by delivering programming that advances communication skills and inclusive daily habits.
We provide learning and training opportunities to increase understanding and dialogue, including the module in our global program: The Heart of Kraft Heinz, focused on our We demand diversity value. We’ve provided training for managers on interrupting bias in our Organizational People Review (OPR) process and specific learning experiences for hiring managers. We’ve continued inclusive leadership sessions for our leadership teams globally.
Since 2015, we have established a solid foundation of awareness across the organization and celebrated numerous impactful achievements in the diversity, inclusion, and belonging space. We have been steadfast in educating and training our leaders to be inclusive, creating a nurturing community. We’ve spotlighted exemplary leaders from all backgrounds and expanded a team of practitioners across our global footprint. We have made significant progress, and we are energized for the long journey ahead of us.
Leading the way is our Global Inclusion Council, chaired by our CEO, Miguel Patricio. The Council comprises executive leadership from across the Company and members of our Board of Directors. The Council creates strategic accountability for results, and provides governance, oversight, and reporting on diversity efforts and initiatives. The Council is also a critical driver in fostering real organizational change, establishing priorities, managing integrated and cross-functional initiatives, and thoughtfully considering how to fully live our Company Values.
We strengthened our commitment to a diverse workforce by targeting employee representation that reflects the diversity of the communities in which we operate.
Together at the Table: Kraft Heinz 2022 ESG Report 50% of our global management positions will be filled by women by 2025.

Diversity, Inclusion, & Belonging (cont.)
In 2021, the work continued. As we continued efforts to collect data to fuel the creation of global aspirations, we also created governance to ensure data privacy. It is important to us that our employees know that we are using data solely to support the creation of a diverse and inclusive workplace. The Global Inclusion Council heard directly from Business Resource Group (BRG) leaders. We joined the Human Rights Campaign - Business Coalition for the Equality Act, and the Civil Alliance, both in the US, and the MOVER Movement in Brazil. We signed the Workplace Pride Declaration of Amsterdam in the Netherlands and spoke out against Anti-Asian violence. We also participated in the Women in the Workplace Study sponsored by McKinsey and LeanIn.Org and the global Bloomberg Gender Equality Index.
Our engagement survey results related to diversity, inclusion, and belonging will be in the top quartile. 
We are on our way to our goal of placing in the top quartile as compared to our peers. In 2021, employee scores improved by 1 point compared to 2020 for ‘feeling a sense of belonging’ and 2 points for ‘feeling like their opinions count’. Scores remained flat for ‘leaders valuing different perspectives’.
50% 30% of our global management positions will be filled by women of our salaried U.S. employee population will identify as people of color. 
Achieved 39% at the end of 2021 (+2 percentage points compared to 2020)

National average of population who identify as ethnic minorities is 14% across the U.K. and 40% within London. The aspiration is based on a weighted average of the split between our populations in our London office and our U.K factories.) 40% of our salaried Brazil employee population will identify as Pretos e Pardos 30% at the end of 2021 (This is on our journey towards our ultimate aspiration of 56%, which is the national average. Pretos e Pardos translates to Black & two or more races respectively.)
We know a truly inclusive culture allows our people to contribute their unique perspectives and ideas, execute with excellence, and grow great careers. We continue to work toward our stated aspirations, as we know that they are critical to our diversity, inclusion, and belonging journey while increasing accountability.
By year end we had achieved our 2021 objectives, increasing by two percentage points respectively for both our Global Women in Management Aspiration and our US Race/Ethnicity Aspiration. We improved our global engagement score for the “Opinions Count” driver and the “Belonging” driver, moving us closer to our 2025 goal of placing in the top quartile as compared to our peers.
In 2021, we added additional demographic aspirations in the UK and Brazil, a result of collecting self-disclosed data across our global footprint. We will continue to develop more aspirations for countries in which we operate after similar data collection efforts.
Regarding our inclusion aspiration, we will seek to qualify these values and metrics with internal confirmation through our regular engagement surveys, and also through supplemental external recognition.

Diversity, Inclusion, & Belonging (cont.)
Creating and Executing a Global Strategy. 
Following a year of transformational growth in 2020, aligned with our value, We demand diversity, in 2021 we created our multi-year DI&B strategy which identified four key areas: Representation, Communication & Learning, Culture, and Communities.
Annual Day of Service. 
June 18, 2021, marked our second annual Kraft Heinz Day of Service – now a part of our annual calendar. The Day of Service commemorated and honored the importance of the Juneteenth holiday, providing opportunities for employees to participate in virtual and in-person service and educational events. In Canada, we hosted an Indigenous Day of Learning to honor the first National Day for Truth and Reconciliation. Our International Zone hosted multiple Days of Service to contribute locally across our global reach.
Employee Development. 
To continue to support the development of our Black employees in the United States, the Black BRG Mentoring Program continued in 2021. We also continued our WeLead Accelerator Program. WeLead was designed to drive accelerated career growth for our employees of color and those who identify as two or more races at the individual contributor level. During this five-month immersive program, 34 participants in the second cohort learned critical business and communication skills, built connections, and activated our Values through our leadership principles.
Launched in 2020, The WE Network, a global leadership accelerator for women at the Associate Director level, graduated it’s second cohort of 31 participants in October 2021.
Additionally, 50 globally nominated women participated in Linkage’s Women in Leadership Conference. This four-day conference equipped leaders with strategies to overcome the hurdles women often face in the workplace. During this immersive leadership development experience, participants learned from expert facilitators, engaged in skilled building sessions and workshops, and completed an assessment to identify their areas of opportunity. These insights provided participants with actions they can immediately apply to accelerate their careers at Kraft Heinz.
Community Support. 
In our EAST Region (Poland, Russia, the Middle East, and our Distributors and Exporters across Eastern Europe), employees participated in a Step Challenge raising $100,000 for the protection, gender, and inclusion initiatives of The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.
In partnership with transgender author Nick North Canada’s Kraft Peanut Butter released a limited-edition children’s book on pronoun use for Transgender Awareness Week. Along with the book, Kraft Peanut Butter made a $15,000 donation to Rainbow Railroad, a charity that helps persecuted LGBTQ+ people get to safety.

Diversity, Inclusion, & Belonging: Creating and Executing a Global Strategy (cont.)
In the US, our Business Resource Groups (BRGs) partnered with some of our biggest brands, Kraft Mac & Cheese, Heinz, and Oscar Mayer, raising over $100,000 to donate to the community organization of their choice. Specifically, we celebrated Pride by raising $34,000 for the Brave Space Alliance, a Black- and Trans-led non-profit on the south side of Chicago dedicated to helping and serving the LGBTQ+ community. The Sabor BRG supported Delimex in raising $8,000 on a fundraising campaign to benefit Heifer International, which allows women and youth farmers in Mexico to have access to education focused on entrepreneurial skills related to selling cage-free eggs, coffee, and honey. In addition, the Black BRG ran a United Negro College Fund (UNCF) campaign raising over $58,000.
Recruiting. 
We remain committed to strengthening our partnerships with organizations that support diversity recruitment. The Kraft Heinz Talent Attraction Team reviewed its partnerships in 2021 to ensure that each alliance was focused to support our goal of hiring talent from diverse backgrounds. Some examples include:
Lime Connect: The largest network of high-potential university students and professionals – including veterans – who have disabilities in the world. Lime Connect also provided Kraft Heinz people managers with training about creating inclusive team environments for employees with disabilities.
National Urban League: An organization committed to finding meaningful employment for underserved Americans.
Lutheran Social Services: Supporting refugee resettlement by connecting newcomers to employment opportunities at Kraft Heinz plants close to refugee centers.
Wounded Warriors Project: Hosted a hiring event for veterans at our Jacksonville plant.
Finger Lakes Youth Apprenticeship Program: Through a partnership with our Avon plant, Kraft Heinz is now an employer of choice for this apprenticeship supporting youth in skilled trades.
Fairshake National Partnership: Demonstrating our commitment to consumer rights, Kraft Heinz is a sponsor and advertises in Fairshake publications nationwide.
WISE (Women in Sales Everywhere): We are the first CPG company to become a networking partner with this organization, developing the next generation of female sales leaders. Our partnership was established in late 2021.
Fostering Inclusion. 
We celebrated cultural diversity through educational opportunities. Various events were held throughout the year, including global celebrations for International Women’s Day and Global Pride. For the first time, we observed International Day for Persons with Disabilities, championing our support for the disabled community. Annually, our BRGs engage in a range of events honoring key dates, including Black History Month, Asian Heritage Month, Latin American/Hispanic Heritage Month, and more.
In Europe, we recommitted to the LEAD Network by signing the CEO pledge for another three years. This renewed commitment works toward attracting, retaining, and advancing women in the consumer goods industry. Since first signing the pledge in 2019, we have made positive progress and increased women in leadership positions in Europe by 10 percentage points. Additionally, we became members of Workplace Pride, a not-for-profit foundation dedicated to improving the lives of LGBTQ+ people in workplaces worldwide.
Business Resource Groups (BRGs)
Our BRGs are a cornerstone of our Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging efforts. Entirely employee driven, these groups provide invaluable education, insight, and community at Kraft Heinz. As a highlight this year, our International Zone piloted a new BRG Leadership journey, where we aim to further support our employee networks with personal and professional development opportunities. The pilot cohort consisted of leaders from our UK and Netherlands BRGs.
Our BRGs in the US Zone include: • Asian Pacific American (APA) BRG • Black BRG • Pride BRG • Sabor BRG (for Latino/a/x & Hispanic employees) • Veterans BRG • Women’s BRG. 
Our BRGs in the Canada Zone include: • The DI&B Committee, which has four sub-committees supporting Gender Diversity, Race/Ethnicity, Pride, and Inclusion. 
Our BRGs in the International Zone include: • Gender Equality Network (GEN) • The 57 (general cultural awareness and employee connection) • Proudz (supporting LGBTQ+ employees) • Reconciliation Reconciliation Working Group - an Australian BRG dedicated to building and delivering a RAP (Reconciliation Action Plan), with the aim to strengthen relationships between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders and non-Indigenous Australians.
Our Value, We demand diversity, continues to guide our efforts across our global footprint and our employees are excited for the opportunity to bring this value to life in new ways. The increase in BRG participation is one of many powerful indicators that our employees are engaged in our diversity, inclusion, and belonging efforts. As a global organization, we are looking forward to continuing to create a diverse environment where all employees feel included, recognized, and supported, with a sense of belonging at Kraft Heinz.
Learning. 
Our Ownerversity learning experiences include opportunities for employees to learn more about diversity, inclusion and belonging. We also deliver several offerings designed to empower employees, develop inclusive leaders, interrupt bias, and foster inclusion and belonging. We offer unique programs, such as The WE Network, a leadership accelerator for women at the associate director level, to ensure we are developing a diverse leadership pipeline. We also collaborate with our Business Resource Groups across the globe to deliver compelling programming that connects employees, increases allyship, and elevates diversity, inclusion, and belonging across Kraft Heinz.

Brand Spotlights. 
Reinvigorating Oscar Mayer. 
Oscar Mayer was founded more than 100 years ago on the principle that all people should have access to quality meat – signified by the yellow ribbon on every product as a band of quality. With this focus on inclusivity rooted in our DNA, we kicked off 2021 by delving into consumer insights and re-evaluating our creative work, and determined that the brand’s marketing and advertising needed to better reflect our increasingly diverse consumers.
With that, we started on a journey to increase representation and transform Oscar Mayer into a more contemporary brand. We launched a new brand platform and mantra, “Keep It Oscar,” rooted in our legacy of sparking unexpected smiles and bringing levity and fun to everyday experiences.
The first year of “Keep It Oscar” focused on our approach to creative work. We shifted our advertisements to a Pop Art style – one that is inherently accessible and rooted in the principle that art can be drawn from any source. In tandem, we made sure the brand’s marketing and advertising represented the diversity of our consumers – both in front of and behind the camera.
This included working with filmmaker Calmatic to direct our “Yum Choir” TV spot that featured a diverse cast, partnering with animation producer Tracey LaGuerre for our “Sandwich Ghost” TV spot, engaging with photographer Justin Bridges to shoot our new line of Street Meat apparel with a diverse group of models, and working with artist Jiaqi Wang to design a custom billboard for our Los Angeles-based fans.
While our journey’s just begun, we’re proud of the representation in our creative work over the past year and how it signals how we will continue to grow as a brand. And we’re just getting started!
Heinz partners with The Lee Initiative to Help Preserve Black-Owned Restaurants’ Cultural Legacy. 
In 2021, Heinz partnered with The LEE Initiative and Southern Restaurants for Racial Justice (SRRJ) in a collective effort to preserve the legacy of Black-owned restaurants through a grant program and other resources to help sustain long-term business health and success. The grants offered through this program are part of a purposeful, multiyear partnership that will grow and evolve over time.
Oscar Mayer worked with popular filmmaker Calmatic to direct its “Yum Choir” TV spot, sparking smiles with its upbeat musical tune.
Animation producer Tracey LaGuerre invoked fun and levity into an Oscar Mayer Cold Cuts TV spot with her “Sandwich Ghost” creation.
Oscar Mayer brought a contemporary look to its Hotdogger apparel, debuting its “Street Meat” collection featuring a diverse group of models shot by famed photographer Justin Bridges.
Artist Jiaqi Wang brought a taste of #KeepItOscar pop art to Los Angeles with a custom mural billboard.

Employee Health & Wellness 24. 
Since 2018, Kraft Heinz has expanded its LiveWell health and wellness platform across the global business units. Our mission is to support and inspire a well-being lifestyle for our employees, so that they can make healthy life choices within and outside of the workplace. Today, LiveWell at Kraft Heinz continues to amplify our commitment to help employees achieve optimal wellbeing physically, emotionally, socially, and financially. Throughout the year, we raise awareness on health and wellbeing. We focus on key topics through speaker series, global and local events, and targeted initiatives on physical fitness, mental health, family and community, and financial education. Our global LiveWell hub provides employees easy access to relevant external resources and internal programs available in their local countries. We continue to champion the LiveWell program’s holistic approach to wellbeing in response to COVID-19 with enhanced programs, including healthcare benefits, disability and employee assistance initiatives. With lifted COVID-19 mandates and varying stages of our return to office, LiveWell has provided additional resources on navigating change for re-entry and safety protocols that are top of mind for employees.
At Kraft Heinz, we have worked to address the stigma attached to discussing and supporting mental health and well-being in the workplace. In 2021, we expanded our Mental Health First Aiders program in the International Zone and Canada with over 120 trained colleagues. We will launch a similar effort in the U.S. in 2022. We also enhanced our Employee Assistance Plans, with programs now available in 31 countries. Late 2021, we initiated the LiveWell Ambassadors program represented by a group of cross-geography and cross-functional employees to collaborate and champion our local and global LiveWell efforts.

The movement is truly global as anyone can learn anywhere and at any time.
Employees not only #MakeTimeForLearning, they also share what they learn with other employees through a Kraft Heinz internal communications platform called KetchApp. Employee participation in the #LearnLikeAnOwner Challenge continued to grow in 2021, with over 1,300 employees making a commitment and logging approximately 36,000 hours of learning.
Since Ownerversity’s inception in 2016, the global and zone learning teams have expanded the Kraft Heinz library to include custom Kraft Heinz learning experiences and curated playlists to help employees find training more easily.

These numbers increased further in 2021, with 537,938 registrations accounting for a total of 14.4 average learning hours per employee. The most attended programs across all Kraft Heinz were our #LearnLikeAnOwner Speaker Series followed by Ownerversity Day, our 24-hour event designed to bring the entire Kraft Heinz family together around learning.
Google Analytics has shown the Ownerversity platform draws a sizable number of visitors year over year, with totals from 2019 and 2020 being fairly consistent (45,151 and 43,494 visitors respectively), and 2021 showing a significant increase (57,781 visitors). In addition to adoption and increased visitors to the platform, for all content overall in Ownerversity for 2021, the results by key measures were very favorable with increases ranging from 1 - 2 percent in effectiveness and value.

The Kraft Heinz Company Foundation (Kraft Heinz Foundation) pursues its mission through strategic partnerships with organizations that have programs aligned with hunger relief, nutrition support and self-sustaining food sources.
Kraft Heinz employees from all corners of the world have passionately joined the Foundation through volunteer efforts towards our goals, highlighting the critical nature and immediacy of our work in helping to alleviate world hunger. We are proud that we achieved our original goal to provide 1 billion nutritious meals to those in need by 2021. At the end of 2021, through a combination of financial support and product donations, we have provided nearly 1.2 billion meals to those in need since 2016. In 2021 alone, we provided approximately 440 million meals to people in need – From 2019 through 2021, we’re now more than halfway to our 2025 goal of providing 1.5 billion meals to those in need.
Working to Alleviate Global Hunger. 
We have aligned our current key partners towards this goal:
The Kraft Heinz Micronutrient Campaign. 
The Kraft Heinz Micronutrient Campaign, established by the H. J. Heinz Company in 2001, aims to use the skills and compassion of our employees to provide a nutritional supplement to promote healthy growth and development of those in hunger in developing regions around the world.
Understanding that nutrition and food are pivotal in the growth and success of a child, and especially significant for malnourished children across the globe, Kraft Heinz developed this micronutrient sachet with essential vitamins and minerals, to be mixed in with more readily available food without all these benefits.
Provide 1.5 billion meals to people in need by 2025 against our 2019 baseline.
PROGRESS ON TRACK: 52%

Rise Against Hunger. 
The Kraft Heinz Foundation (and prior to that, the H.J. Heinz Holding Corporation) have been a partner of Rise Against Hunger since 2013. Originating from the desire to provide nutritious and efficient meals to those facing hunger across the world, our partnership with Rise Against Hunger now impacts a wide variety of issues ranging from addressing global hunger through localized, urgent needs, to wider systemic, long-term projects. Today, we are Rise Against Hunger’s largest partner.
28. 
In July 2021, the Kraft Heinz Foundation committed to a $12 million donation, dispersed over the following three years, to support Rise Against Hunger’s global efforts to end world hunger. This commitment will support Rise Against Hunger’s sustainable agriculture projects, local procurement efforts and the packaging and distribution of Rise Against Hunger meals, including the supplying of Kraft Heinz micronutrient sachets. These sachets, added to Rise Against Hunger’s meal bags, include 18 essential vitamins and minerals. Kraft Heinz’s micronutrient sachets have fortified over 400 million Rise Against Hunger meals to date.
During the first year of this commitment, Rise Against Hunger was able to reach over 2.7 million people, and, through food distribution, local procurement and sustainable agriculture projects, supply them with the equivalent of approximately 253 million meals.
Key Highlights from 2021:
Sustainable Agriculture. 
Participants in Rise Against Hunger’s sustainable agriculture projects, supported by Kraft Heinz, in Malawi, Mali, South Sudan, Senegal and Zimbabwe produced 14,340 metric tons of food. This was equivalent to more than 214,067,750 meals. These projects, which Rise Against Hunger implements with local partners, support long-term food security through a variety of initiatives, including sustainable agricultural training, microenterprise loan programs to support small business, installations of water wells and solar pumps, and more.
Nourishing Lives Through Meals. 
Rise Against Hunger also works to strengthen food and nutrition security through safety-net food assistance programs in chronically food insecure regions, such as Nicaragua, Tanzania, Timor-Leste Indonesia and India. Many of these meals and locally procured food are distributed in educational settings to also support children’s education.

LAUNCH Project. 
Implemented by Rise Against Hunger and its in-country partner Development in Gardening, the Leveraging Agriculture to Unite Communities and Hospitals (LAUNCH) project has been working to improve food security for at-risk populations in southern Senegal. The sustainable agriculture project establishes community gardens and supports participants as they set up home gardens. In 2021, approximately 2,394 pounds of crops were harvested by LAUNCH participants in community gardens, homes and demonstration gardens. To date, 20 community gardens and 16 facility gardens have been established, each averaging 30 varieties of produce, in Ziguinchor, and 948 people have been trained on sustainable agriculture practices.
Fatou, a farmer from Casamance, Senegal, is one of the LAUNCH project participants. Before joining the project, Fatou used traditional techniques on her farm. Due to the dry climate and lack of water for irrigation, this limited her to a small selection of crops she could plant. Through the project, Fatou learned new gardening techniques and water conservation practices, like gardening in tires as well as diversifying her garden to increase her vegetable production. She has now been able to increase her farming yields by almost 40 percent, allowing to her to meet her family’s financial and household needs.

Project Spotlights. 
Pandemic Relief in Indonesia. 
During Indonesia’s COVID-19 lockdowns in 2021, many Indonesian families struggled to get the food and nutrition that they needed. Rise Against Hunger’s Malaysia office, along with partner HOPE Worldwide Indonesia, designed and distributed shelf-stable food boxes that included rice, mung beans, oil, flour and sugar to ensure that families continued to receive adequate sustenance during this time. The initiative reached seven major cities across Java, Indonesia’s most populous island, benefitting over 16,700 individuals.

Feeding America. 
Feeding America® is a nationwide network of 200 foodbanks and 60,000 food pantries with meal programs that serve every county in America. In Feeding America’s words, “to end hunger, we have to make hunger unacceptable,” and that is why the organization encourages everyone to take action in the fight to end hunger – an issue that impacts one in nine of our neighbors.
Our relationship with Feeding America dates back to Kraft Foods Group. Inc., as one of the original groups to provide the organization with financial support in the 1980s.
Today, Kraft Heinz helps Feeding America achieve its mission in a three-pronged approach. First, we help member food banks meet immediate hunger needs through food donations from our corporate operations. In 2021, we donated just under 15 million pounds of food to the Feeding America network through 33 local member food banks aligned with our U.S. manufacturing sites, bringing our total since 2016 to more than 117 million pounds of food donated. Second, through The Kraft Heinz Foundation’s philanthropic giving we are able to significantly amplify food donations to families in need on a planned basis. Third, we further partner with Feeding America through cause marketing and volunteerism, all aimed at our shared mission to end hunger.
“Hunger is an issue that impacts every community in our country, and at Feeding America, we work hard every day to help people who may not know where they will find their next meal. We are incredibly grateful for our longstanding partnership with Kraft Heinz and for its generous support of our network. Through monetary and food donations, along with volunteer engagement, Kraft Heinz has helped us provide more meals to our neighbors when they need it most.” – Casey Marsh, Chief Development Officer, Feeding America. 
Share our Strength: No Kid Hungry Campaign. 
No child should go hungry in America but in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, 1 in 6 kids could face hunger. In 2021, the Kraft Heinz Foundation made another significant investment in No Kid Hungry’s efforts to end childhood hunger and bringing No Kid Hungry one step closer to their goal to make sure that every child gets three meals a day. The Foundation’s grants support No Kid Hungry’s efforts to launch and improve critical programs that help ensure kids have consistent access to food. These grants can help provide up to 2.5 million meals to kids across the U.S.* “Kraft Heinz Foundation’s continued partnership with No Kid Hungry is a strong indication of their deep understanding of the issues that contribute to childhood hunger in the US. And as we continue to navigate the impact of the pandemic on families and the schools and community organizations that were their lifeline for consistent access to food, partners like Kraft Heinz Foundation ensure we are able to help programs reach as many kids as possible. We are so grateful for this partnership.” – Jill Davis, Chief Revenue Officer, No Kid Hungry * Meal equivalency varies during COVID-19 relief.
Red Cross. 
Vision Statement: The American Red Cross, through its strong network of volunteers, donors and partners, is always there in times of need.
Through a network of about 250 chapters in the U.S., the American Red Cross provides relief to victims of disaster and helps people prevent, prepare for and respond to emergencies. As a member of the organization’s Disaster Responder Program, The Kraft Heinz Foundation is part of a select group of forward-thinking organizations that provide the highest level of year-round support to Red Cross disaster relief and preparedness efforts. The advance commitment – before disaster strikes – empowers the Red Cross to be ready to help disaster survivors at a moment’s notice, while also preparing people and communities for crises yet to come.
“The American Red Cross is part of nearly every community in the U.S., which means our work before, during and after disasters is never finished. We are extremely thankful to The Kraft Heinz Company Foundation for their year-round support as a Disaster Responder Program member. This forward-thinking commitment enables us to prepare communities for the unexpected and rush immediate relief to people affected by disasters whenever and wherever they strike.” – Jennifer Pipa, Vice President, Disaster Programs, American Red Cross.

Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank “Across southwestern Pennsylvania one in seven people don’t have enough to eat. With the tremendous partnership of the Kraft Heinz Foundation through our Grow, Share, Thrive campaign, we will be able to ensure our neighbors have access to the food they need today, tomorrow and for a lifetime. Thank you!” – Lisa Scales, President and CEO, Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank. 
Greater Chicago Food Depository “The Kraft Heinz Company, co-headquartered here in Chicago, remains a leading supporter of the Greater Chicago Food Depository and our more than 700 community partners across Cook County. Since 2016, Kraft Heinz has donated the equivalent of nearly 5 million meals to its neighbors facing food insecurity – 750,000 meals in the last year alone. We are so grateful for this relationship, especially as we continue to respond to an elevated need for food assistance. Companies like Kraft Heinz help us create a truly Greater Chicago.” – Kate Maehr, Executive Director and CEO, Greater Chicago Food Depository. 
Grow Pittsburgh “Our partnership with Kraft Heinz has helped people throughout the Pittsburgh region grow thriving gardens and share meals with their families and neighbors. Thank you for bolstering food security and food sovereignty in our community.” – Denele Hughson, Executive Director, Grow Pittsburgh. 
The Lunchbox Fund “Our partnership with Kraft Heinz has been transformative to so many children’s lives. As a result of the company’s support, we’re now able to provide over 1,500 extra daily breakfast meals in-school to children from very poor families who typically do not have access to food before school. This essential first meal of the day supports the children’s ability to learn, leading to better educational performance. These nutrition-rich meals also act as a critical incentive to encourage students to be punctual and stay in school, broadening their educational opportunities and increasing their lifetime income potential. These breakfasts are, quite literally, life-changing.” – Topaz Page-Green, Founder, Lunchbox Fund. 
Pantry Day and Food Banks Canada. 
In conjunction with World Food Day, Kraft Heinz Canada held its second annual Kraft Heinz Pantry Day. Canadians joined the fight against food insecurity by purchasing a participating Kraft Heinz product in-store or online, which was then matched with a donation to Food Banks Canada. Participating products included any variety of Kraft Peanut Butter, Philadelphia Cream Cheese, Kraft Salad Dressing, Kraft Dinner, Classico Pasta Sauce, Heinz by Nature, Maxwell House Coffee or Heinz Ketchup.
The initiative, which is part of a larger 5-year, $20-million product donation to Food Banks Canada is helping connect the 4.4 million Canadians affected by food insecurity across the country with the meals they need. Since 2020, the company has contributed 3,281,900 pounds in high-quality food donations to food banks across the country in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Child Aid “In 2021, the Kraft Heinz Foundation continued its important support of Guatemalan children and their families as part of Child Aid’s White Flag Hunger Relief Campaign by awarding a second $75,000 grant (approximately 579,600 meals) for emergency food relief. Since the onset of the global pandemic, the foundation has provided more than one million meals to starving families in the northern highlands of Guatemala. The continued spread of COVID-19 continues to challenge families in a nation already crippled by poverty, inflation and climate change. Through Child Aid and the Kraft Heinz Foundation, hungry families received boxes of emergency supplies meant to keep hunger at bay for approximately three weeks. Each emergency box contains one pound of beans, one pound of rice, one liter of oil, one pound of noodles, powdered milk, salt, sugar, hand sanitizer and children’s vitamins.” – Nancy Press, Chief Executive Officer, Child Aid.

Magic Breakfast 2021 marked the third year of our partnership with Magic Breakfast, a charity that provides healthy school breakfasts to hungry and malnourished children in disadvantaged areas of the U.K. We increased the number of schools we supported with our No Added Sugar Heinz Beanz from 150 to 300 and pledged over 16 million meals for children at risk of hunger in the U.K. 2021 also saw the continuation of Kraft Heinz employees mentoring the Magic Breakfast team, including the pilot of a new work experience programme at Leeds City Academy, and virtual mentoring programmes with school children. In February 2021, Magic Breakfast, Kraft Heinz, and think tank Pro Bono Economics collaborated to release new research illustrating the cost effectiveness of a government funded school breakfast provision in the U.K., where every £1 invested by the government would generate £50 for the local economy across a child’s lifetime. Building on this profile-raising work, Magic Breakfast and Kraft Heinz later collaborated to release a limited-edition Heinz Beanz can in Tesco to highlight the importance of Magic Breakfast’s great work in ensuring no child is too hungry to learn.

Global Nutrition Guidelines The Kraft Heinz Global Nutrition Guidelines identify nutrient targets for our products, with a focus on limiting sugar, sodium, saturated fat and calories. In addition, we continue to be committed to increase positive nutrients, offering delicious products with improved nutrition profiles.
As part of this process, the Kraft Heinz Global Nutrition Group identified upper limits for calories, sodium, sugar and saturated fat across 50 categories that represent our total global portfolio. Products that meet these nutrition guidelines align with globally recognized dietary recommendations from the World Health Organization, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, and the European Food Safety Authority.
Progress on Healthy Living Goals. 
Compliance* with Kraft Heinz’s Global Nutrition Targets (GNTs) fell from 74.7 percent in 2020 to 67.7 percent in 2021. This decrease resulted from two main contributory factors: • Inclusion of expanded regional data • Updated nutritional information. 
In 2021, efforts focused on improving the quality of data and transparency within regions that had not previously been measured. Expanded assessed regions included China, Indonesia, Brazil, and the Middle East, which increased global data volume assessed by 15 percent. We continue to improve data quality and nutrition profiles in regions which are early in their nutrition target compliance journey.
Product Health. 
The fall in GNTs compliance was also impacted by updated sodium nutritional information for Heinz tomato ketchup in North America; this was not the consequence of changes to the formulation. In addition, Kraft Heinz normalized serving sizes to 100 grams for all category targets globally to help ensure a consistent and common baseline.
Further to our GNTs, we successfully reduced just under 10 million pounds of total sugar across our portfolio in 2021, 16 percent towards our goal of reducing 60 million pounds of total sugar across our global portfolio by 2025. This reduction was primarily driven by our ABC brand in Indonesia in combination with multiple initiatives across Asia, Australia, and Europe. We are confident that we will reach our goal and have an ambitious roadmap, including significant sugar reductions in our beverages as well as other global initiatives. In 2021, there was no progress on our North America sodium reduction goal but we are implementing plans to help ensure achievement by 2025.
* Inclusive of all countries with measurable data where Kraft Heinz operates, which was expanded to include volumes from China, Indonesia, Brazil, and the Middle East in 2021. Kraft Heinz Foodservice, Kraft Heinz Ingredients and infant/toddler categories are not included in the overall metric. Kraft Heinz Foodservice and Kraft Heinz Ingredients items do not have specific nutrition targets and infant/toddler product targets are based on local guidelines.
We recognize the magnitude of effort required and remain committed to achieving 85 percent compliance with our GNTs by 2025.
Improve product health & nutrition by achieving 85% compliance with Kraft Heinz Global Nutrition Targets by 2025.
Reduce total sugar in our products by more than 60 million pounds across our global portfolio by 2025.
Reduce sodium by an additional 5% in our BBQ Sauce and Kraft Salad Dressings in North America by 2025.
Improve use and transparency of simpler ingredients by 2025.

PROGRESS ON TRACK. 
Innovation Partnerships. 
At Kraft Heinz, we see challenges as opportunities for innovation and a way to provide better products for consumers. We aim to create innovations that satisfy consumer demand for new and health-conscious brands that they can feel good about. We do that by constantly researching, developing and launching products that reflect modern tastes, leading trends, and consumer preferences. Our focus is on incremental volumes and mix improvement coming from new products.
Plant-based. 
The Heinz brand has been making high quality, plant-based products for over 150 years. Below are some examples of our plant-based launches in 2021.
In conjunction with Veganuary, Heinz launched vegan versions of several of its well-loved products. The brand also launched three varieties of ‘Beanz Burgers’, each containing 10 grams of protein and packed full of beans. These tiny parcels of superpower make a great range of nutritionally rich meat-free products packed with all of the goodness of beans & veggies.
In select regions, Heinz launched a fully vegan mayo range, including flavors such as original, smoky chili and garlic aioli.
In addition, the brand also introduced a vegan alternative to its fan favorite Heinz Salad Cream. This vegan alternative has the same deliciously zingy taste of Heinz Salad Cream we all know and love, but is suitable for vegans while also being gluten free and containing no artificial colors, flavors or preservatives.
Organic. 
To offer consumers choices that help them meet their lifestyle and wellness goals, we have brands with organic offerings that we are constantly looking to expand.
United States: In the United States, our certified organic products adhere to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Organic Program standards and regulations. Our organic certified products include certain Capri-Sun juices, Heinz tomato ketchup products and Classico sauces. Our organic labelled products are designed to ensure that all agricultural products contained within them meet organic criteria and less than 5 percent of the total product contains allowable non-organic ingredients.
Canada: In Canada, our organic products comply with the Canadian Organic Standards as required by the Canadian Organic Regime (COR). Examples include our Kraft Dinner organic Original Macaroni & Cheese, Heinz organic tomato ketchup, Classico organic pasta sauces, and Heinz organic baby foods and cereals.
Europe: In Europe, we offer Heinz tomato ketchup with 100 percent organic tomatoes to meet the needs of consumers. In the U.K., we also offer our delicious Heinz baked beans and cream of tomato soup with organically grown beans and tomatoes.

APC Microbiome Ireland has been a strong partner of Kraft Heinz since 2020. Throughout 2021, we continued our partnership aimed at discovering new, natural cultures for fermented foods that could unlock the ultimate natural and clean label opportunities for product development. While the health benefits of fermented natural cultures (such as probiotics) are important to Kraft Heinz, our collaboration with APC Microbiome Ireland largely focuses on the discovery of novel bioactive and functional compounds derived from traditional food cultures. The technologies that we will develop as a result of this strategic partnership will align with the growing demand for cleaner, consumer-friendly ingredients and products.

Master Low Salt Weijixian Soy Sauce. 
In 2021, Our Master brand launched Master Low Salt Weijixian Soy Sauce. The product was developed to stand out by not only reducing salt by 28 percent, but by adding high quality dried scallops to elevate taste, creating a heathier and superior umami taste. This product is of one of the many examples of our brands stepping up to create healthy and delicious products for consumers in China.
Sugar Reductions in Central and South America. 
Across various regions, we have strived to reduce sugar content across our baby food line. In Venezuela and Mexico, we implemented a 10 percent sugar reduction across our Heinz and Polly brands wet baby foods. While in Costa Rica we implemented a 1 percent sugar reduction across the same product range. We aim to continue to prioritize reductions across more categories in the coming years.
Philadelphia Lactose Free Brick Cream Cheese. 
Philadelphia Original Brick Cream Cheese blends the creamy goodness of Philly with real milk and cream, now available in Lactose Free! It’s a great addition to any meal, from appetizers to desserts.

Plasmon has always been attentive to the needs of children. In 2021, we developed a version of our well-loved children’s biscotto in Italy with 30 percent less sugar (compared to the classic Plasmon biscuit) still, with that unmistakable Plasmon taste. The biscuit also contains calcium, selected B vitamins and iron which contributes to normal cognitive development and the immune system.
Heinz Veg Hoops. 
This everyday favorite gives you the same great taste of the original Heinz Spaghetti Hoops that families have been enjoying for years but with 30 percent EXTRA veg. This tasty new plant powered recipe launched in the UK, uses pasta hoops made from carrot and cauliflower, served in a smooth and delicious tomato and sweet potato sauce. What’s more, they’re 100 percent plant-based, meaning they’re suitable for vegans, vegetarians, and anyone looking to enjoy more plant-based everyday meals.
Heinz Beanz Protein Pot. 
Heinz in the U.K. launched a microwavable breakfast pot that contains its signature beans but also sausage, spinach and scrambled egg. The Beans Protein Pots – which come in at 235 calories each – are also a great source of protein with 14.6g per serving, and are high in fiber and low in sugar.

Food Safety & Quality. 
Kraft Heinz is a globally trusted producer of delicious foods. We take our responsibility with respect to food safety and quality very seriously, and we will not compromise on it. We all want to have confidence in the food on our plates.
We implement a consistent, comprehensive food safety and product quality management process across our global supply chain. Through this, Kraft Heinz is committed to meeting regulatory compliance with industry standards. Our food safety and product quality management process has been designed by us for us. We utilize leading methodologies to ensure food is manufactured safely, complies with local regulations and meets or exceeds the quality standards we’ve set for our products.
Compliance with our own internal food safety and product quality management system helps ensure our owned factories are also compliant with Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI) recognized certification (e.g. FSSC 22000). Many of our factories undergo third party audits and achieve third party certification to demonstrate this. Kraft Heinz also serves on the GFSI Steering Committee (alongside major producers and retailers), working through challenges to enable the GFSI objectives, including governance & technical working groups.
In addition to complying with our internal food safety and product quality management system, we also monitor other external metrics including product recall, serious incidents and factory related consumer complaints.

Transparency & Labeling. 
We have a responsibility to communicate information about our products to ensure that consumers can feel good about what they are feeding their families. At Kraft Heinz, we’re committed to being transparent and helping consumers make informed food and beverage choices, whether at home or at the grocery store.
Front of Pack Nutrition Labeling. 
Consumers consistently say they want more information on how their food is made and what it contains. To address this need, we are voluntarily making our nutrition information easier for consumers to find by providing nutrition information on the front of our product packaging in certain markets.
Facts Up Front: U.S.
We have widely implemented the Facts Up Front program for key Kraft Heinz products to help consumers plan nutritious meals for their family. This voluntary program was developed in the U.S. in 2011 to increase nutrition transparency and access by displaying calories, saturated fat, sugar and sodium on the front of each package. The visual informs consumers about the nutrients in each product and how they fit into a balanced and healthy diet as part of the federal daily dietary advice.
Health Star Rating: Australia & New Zealand. 
Kraft Heinz supports the voluntary Health Star Rating front-of-pack labelling system in Australia and New Zealand. The Health Star Rating system rates the overall nutritional profile of packaged foods using a strict calculation and assigns a rating from ½ a star to 5 stars. The heath star rating is an easy way to help consumers compare the nutrition of similar packaged foods and make healthier food choices. The independent Health Star Rating system was developed in 2014 by governments in collaboration with public health experts, the food industry and consumer groups. Kraft Heinz continues to support and implement Health Star Ratings on a number of our packaged food products in Australia and New Zealand.
SmartLabel®
In the U.S. and Canada, we provide product information through the SmartLabel website. Responding to the information needs of today’s consumer, the SmartLabel™ initiative enables Kraft Heinz to provide consumers with the detailed information they seek about our products. More than 2,700 Kraft Heinz products have been listed on smartlabel.org, including Boca, Capri Sun, Classico, Gevalia, Mio, Jell-O, and many others, with plans to add more for both the U.S. and Canada. See http://www.smartlabel.org/products to find Kraft Heinz products.
Traffic Light: United Kingdom. 
Our journey toward more transparency involves listening to our stakeholders. By participating in the Traffic Light program in the U.K., we hope to provide consistency in labeling to U.K. consumers. Under the traffic-light system, food and drink labels show whether levels of sugar, salt and fat are high, medium or low using red, amber and green traffic light colors – and is based on the amount per 100g.

Kraft Heinz is committed to reducing its operational environmental footprint. We have prioritized projects across our global manufacturing network in the areas of water conservation, energy use and greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs), waste reduction and packaging.
In 2021, we made positive progress towards all of these goals compared to our 2019 baseline.
Sustainability Goals in Manufacturing. 
Kraft Heinz Management System. 
The Kraft Heinz Management System (KHMS) standard practices are organized into eight pillars, each with its specific function but simultaneously interconnected to drive sustainable efficiency improvements. Since adopting this framework, we have completed many innovative and impactful projects across the world, making significant positive progress toward our ESG goals. The following pages describe our progress and examples of successful projects across each of our environmental goals.
In 2021, we made positive progress towards all of these goals compared to our 2019 baseline. We reduced water use intensity by 4.4 percent for all sites, and by 12.2 percent in high-risk watershed areas. We also reduced the intensity of energy use by 5.1 percent, and waste by 14.7 percent. We are confident we have set up the proper management systems (read more about our Kraft Heinz Management system to the right) and governance structure, while leveraging appropriate resources to keep us on course toward full achievement of our manufacturing goals by 2025.
We continue to recognize the significant environmental impacts an ever-growing world can have, and we remain steadfast to balance production processes that can meet global food demand with efficient operation. Through thorough assessment and strong management processes and routines, we see opportunities for improvement at various stages of our operations, and we will learn from external perspectives, as well as ourselves by continuously fostering efficiency improvements in an environment of collaboration, ownership, and innovation. The Kraft Heinz Management System (KHMS) is a set of standard practices and routines, tailored to advance our operational excellence journey. KHMS is one of the key drivers of our sustainable manufacturing strategy as it guides the implementation of practices to reduce water use, energy use, GHG emissions and waste output. These practices help guide our manufacturing teams to continuously challenge themselves toward our strategic goals and learn better ways of working to improve and sustain their results.

Water Use & Conservation. 
Water is fundamental to all life and business either directly or indirectly. Making high-quality products requires that we begin with high-quality ingredients of which fresh quality water is a key input. Kraft Heinz is committed to water stewardship in each aspect of our business, from our quality controls to the relationships we have with our growers and suppliers. As a food and beverage company, having access to sufficient amounts of quality fresh water, both now and in the future, is critical to our business. Water is used in many areas of our value chain. It is a vital input for growing various agricultural ingredients we use in our products. We also use water as a direct ingredient in many of our products and as a key utility in our manufacturing, cleaning and sanitation processes. Access to high quality water is pivotal for us to achieve our high standards of food safety and quality. High-quality water will continue to be a vital component throughout our value chain.
We aim to decrease water use intensity by 20 percent by 2025 at our water stressed sites. In 2021, we reduced water use intensity by 12.2 percent as compared to our 2019 baseline.
We aim to decrease water use intensity by 15 percent in all manufacturing facilities by 2025. In 2021, we reduced overall water use intensity by 4.4 percent as compared to our 2019 baseline.

Conserving Water Through Innovation. 
Our Christchurch, New Zealand facility is a key manufacturer of our Wattie’s brand that offers a wide variety of frozen and packaged fruit, vegetables, and other customer favorites. In 2021, the facility successfully reduced water use intensity by 21 percent. The facility achieved this through a series of efficiency improvements, including water recycling systems and increased water usage visibility through better sensor technology, and the use of portable flow meters throughout the facility.
Our Christchurch facility created an innovation to address the large volume of water used to de-ice its blast freezer tunnels and bulk freezer stores. The new process feeds water through its de-superheater system. This heated water makes the de-icing process more efficient as compared to using room temperature water. The upgraded system also ensures that the water is collected, filtered, and used in a secondary process.

Partnership with Ecolab. 
Over the past few years, Kraft Heinz and Ecolab have partnered closely to help achieve our environmental goals. Together, we have adopted a comprehensive approach to sustainability that includes hundreds of operational efficiency projects at manufacturing sites across North America. – These projects target reduction of the company’s water and emissions footprints while ensuring product quality and compliance. Through water reuse, cleaning efficiency and optimization projects, we have conserved millions of gallons of water. These efforts have helped ensure that Kraft Heinz has sufficient water for its operations, while reducing its intake of local freshwater.
Nalco Water is an Ecolab company that has created a unique 3D TRASAR™ Technology. This technology has played a major role in boosting water and energy efficiency in critical utility systems, while our Clean in Place (CIP) programs have helped optimize cleaning efficiency to improve cleaning turn-around time, reduce water and energy use and increase production. In addition, Ecolab and Kraft Heinz are working closely to conduct Total Plant Assessment (TPA) audits. These TPA audits provide a holistic, end-to-end review of a Kraft Heinz facility’s water and energy use, followed by recommendations for mitigation. This enables Ecolab and Kraft Heinz to continuously identify and drive operational and environmental improvement projects. Four TPAs were conducted in 2021 at Kraft Heinz manufacturing sites. As a result of these projects Kraft Heinz was able to save 193 thousand cubic meters of water, 410 megawatts of electricity and 170 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent.
Partnership with Suez Water Technologies & Solutions. 
We have been working with Suez Water Technologies & Solutions (Suez WTS) over the years to decrease water and energy use across multiple sites.
Starting with a thorough water and energy assessment, we identified areas with leakages, excess water use, energy inefficiencies and opportunities for water reuse.
In 2021, we prioritized the following: • Water mapping for cooling systems in Northgate, Australia:
Improved system knowledge and control, reducing water losses of approximately 4 million gallons of water annually (the equivalent to approximately six Olympic swimming pools or the annual water consumption of more than 2,000 households in Northgate).
• Optimization of boiler units across multiple facilities: Instituted better control on water quality and asset management of boilers to enhance efficiency, resulting in a direct reduction of CO2 emissions to the atmosphere.
• Digitalization initiatives in Christchurch, New Zealand: Invested in better control and automation of our utilities. For example, we increased the performance of our cooling systems to save approximately 3.5 million gallons of water annually.
Water Use & Conservation (cont.)
We recognize the significant role we can play as a global food manufacturer in our own operations and through our supply chain in being good water stewards. Kraft Heinz is a proud signatory to the CEO Water Mandate. As we continue to assess and improve in this critical area to our business, and in collaboration with various stakeholders throughout our value chain, we look forward to continue to report out on our water stewardship initiatives and benchmarks now and in the future.

Water Risk Assessment. 
In early 2018, we completed a water risk assessment of our global manufacturing operations. This work was completed by Antea Group, a leading global sustainability consulting firm and provider of water resource expertise to the food and beverage sector who is also certified by CDP. The assessment leveraged both WRI’s (World Resources Institute) Aqueduct data and methodology along with the subject matter expertise of our consulting partner. We then evaluated our watershed conditions from a business perspective in order to validate economic scarcity factors not fully addressed by the database indicators. The completed assessment resulted in identification of physical, reputational/ social and quality water risks, as well as composite scores for each area associated in our direct manufacturing operations. In 2020, we updated our water risk assessment . Of the total 81 sites that we operated in, we completed a watershed risk assessment of 79 sites. Water use from these 79 sites derived from 66 percent municipal, 25 percent bore and nine percent surface.
After an internal expert committee evaluation, it was determined that 19 of the 79 sites evaluated had some degree of elevated water stress. In addition to our water reduction targets, we have also developed a plan that focuses on these high-risk water areas to drive improvements and mitigate risks, and to provide updates into our risk evaluation on an ongoing basis. Moreover, we will evaluate any interim mitigation strategies as needed.

Restoring Local Wetlands. 
Our Alfaro, Spain site, while not a water stressed site, is surrounded by a unique wetland nature reserve, ‘Carrizal de Cofin’. The reserve is home to a variety of important native bird species. Without responsible water stewardship, these wetlands run the risk of drying out and putting the local ecosystem at risk. The local government of La Rioja region saw an opportunity for restoration and enlisted the help of our Alfaro facility to help irrigate the reserve using treated wastewater from our site. Our facility produces approximately 200,000 cubic meters of wastewater per year (equivalent to 80 Olympic-sized swimming pools). We treat this wastewater to the highest of standards and return it to the environment.. This initiative transformed approximately 142 hectares of the nature reserve from dry land into a lush, green functioning resource for the local ecosystem.

Energy Use & Conservation. 
Manufacturing our products to finished packaged goods and maintaining our highest standards around safety, quality, and sanitation, all while providing a comfortable and secure environment for our employees to work, can consume significant amounts of energy. In this type of interdependent environment, we know many opportunities exist to reduce energy consumption through operational optimization. We are on a journey of continuous improvement to identify our opportunities in this area and capitalize on them.
Our Kraft Heinz manufacturing facilities across the globe have been undergoing a significant digital transformation to improve the tracking and efficiency of our energy and other utility usage onsite. For example, in 2021 our Kirksville facility in the U.S. conducted a steam trap digital monitoring pilot to improve energy efficiency by better detecting any steam track failures, which are commonplace at the site. The new digital, infra-red system solution helped technicians spot steam failures early and better utilize their time on other critical plant needs instead of manually troubleshooting any failures. The pilot successfully improved energy efficacy and the Company is looking to expand this pilot to other high-use steam facilities.

Another key example of our energy saving initiatives is at our Cairo facility. Approximately 24 percent of the facility’s electricity consumption comes from its compressed air usage. Teams on the ground worked to implement an air compressor scorecard to monitor energy consumption and also built better monitoring devices. Over the course of 2021, the facility was able to save approximately 15 percent of overall electricity consumption.
As a leading global food and beverage company, our scale provides a unique ability to test concepts at various sites, learn from ourselves, prove outcomes, and then implement successful energy savings initiatives across our business.
We aim to decrease energy use intensity by 15 percent by 2025. In 2021, we reduced energy use intensity by 5.1 percent as compared to our 2019 baseline.

Renewable Energy. 
Kraft Heinz is committed to operating responsibly and doing its part in the critical global efforts to reduce the harmful impacts of climate change. A big component of that commitment is both reducing how much energy we consume, and thereby reducing the associated emissions where applicable, as well as rethinking our energy sources.
Decarbonizing our Operations at Kitt Green U.K.
In 2021, we signed a Memorandum of Understanding with HyNet, a leading decarbonization project in the U.K., that will supply low carbon hydrogen to fuel our Kitt Green facility. Kitt Green is one of Europe’s largest food processing facilities, producing more than 1 billion cans of food per year.
Switching to low carbon hydrogen is a critical piece of the Net Zero puzzle and will enable a switch away from fossil fuels starting in 2025. From 2025, HyNet and North Wales will produce, store and distribute low carbon hydrogen, as well as capture and safely store carbon dioxide (CO2).

Net Zero and Science Based Targets. 
In 2021 we announced our pledge to achieve net zero greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions across our operational footprint (Scope 1 and Scope 2) and entire global value chain (Scope 3) by 2050, establishing our major commitment to contribute to global efforts to reduce the ongoing threat of climate change. As a milestone on our path to achieve net zero emissions, we will target a near-term emissions reduction of 50 percent by 2030 across all three scopes. We anticipate submitting and receiving approval of our quantitative goals from the Science Based Targets Initiative over the next year.
Key focus areas of our net zero program include: • Promoting regenerative and sustainable practices across the. 
Company’s agricultural supply chain through its Sustainable Agricultural Practices Manual, which guides efforts to source 100 percent of Heinz ketchup tomatoes sustainably by 2025.
• Transitioning to more circular and recyclable consumer packaging.
• Procuring a majority of the Company’s electricity from renewable sources by 2025, and continuing to transition key on-site manufacturing facilities to renewable energy sources.
A considerable portion of our total carbon footprint is produced from our Scope 3 emissions, and more specifically originate in our supply chain (see graphs to the right for emissions breakdown). Agriculture related emissions are particularly significant and provide the greatest opportunity for reduction through increased collaboration.
Overall, our highest impact Scope 3 categories in order of magnitude, are: • Ingredients • Packaging • Upstream and downstream transportation • Use of sold products • End-of-life. 
We will remain focused on optimizing our immediate operational footprint to lessen our impact on the climate, while we increasingly investigate joint initiatives with our suppliers to help ensure the highest quality products are produced. We expect to share more details on our Scope 3 reduction strategy in future reports.

Waste Reduction. 
At Kraft Heinz, we think about waste holistically. To source, produce and package food and beverage products requires several inputs and outputs related to ingredients and byproducts, material flows and end-of-life packaging considerations. When we think about materials and food-related flows, detailed waste evaluations help us identify where we can ‘prevent, reduce, repurpose and recycle.’ In fact, our global owned manufacturing sites divert more than 90 percent of our solid waste to recycling or byproducts usage.
In 2021, five new Kraft Heinz manufacturing facilities achieved zero waste-to-landfill status, bringing our total to 16 facilities across the world. These new sites include Shanghai (China), Kaiping (China), Pudliszki (Poland), Yangjiang (China), Pasuruan (Indonesia) and Wagga Wagga (Australia). Diverting Waste at Guadalajara. 
Our facility in Guadalajara, Mexico embarked on a series of projects to divert waste from being sent to the landfill. The site primarily achieved this by sending any leftover packaging to undergo pyrolysis. This process allows for any unsaleable product to be treated and turned into fuel, increasing the circularity of our waste. The site also began a program to divert sludge waste destined for the landfill to be utilized for composting. In total, the site was able to reduce its waste by approximately 900 tons in 2021.

Reducing Food Waste. 
According to the United Nations Environmental Program, it is estimated that approximately 931 million tons of food waste were generated in 2019, suggesting that 17 percent of global food production may be going to waste. Beyond this, food waste is detrimental to our environment, leading to wasted resources like energy, water and land. As our population grows, the pressure on our water, land and energy to feed all those people will only increase. It is also estimated that 8 – 10 percent of our greenhouse gases are associated with food that is not consumed1.
Therefore, when we think of food waste at Kraft Heinz, we think of it in terms of our highest priorities. We focus on the entire value chain in terms of where food waste can be reduced. This includes sourcing, production, transportation, shelf life, use and end-of- life. We analyze and test how processes, products and packaging can be optimized. We investigate where unneeded byproducts or unwanted finished products can find other uses versus going to landfill, such as beneficial land application and product donations to those in need.
For example, our Mount Royal facility in Canada has implemented new segregation of organic waste initiatives on the production line. We send organic waste to an anaerobic digester cell and, in 2021, have succeeded in diverting approximately 600 tons of organic waste.
Kraft Heinz has joined together with industry peers to eliminate food waste globally. Kraft Heinz Canada and Kraft Heinz United Kingdom both joined national commitments to reduce food waste.
U.K.: In the U.K., Kraft Heinz is a member of the Food Waste Reduction Roadmap (FWRR) initiative. Hundreds of food-related organizations have committed to supporting this initiative, which aims to reduce food waste in the U.K. by 50 percent by 2030. The initiative is run by IGD (a food research and training organization) and WRAP (a nonprofit focused on sustainability) to verify data and encourage best practices. Kraft Heinz committed to setting a target for food waste reduction across our own operations towards the broader goal, and to also work in partnership with suppliers and consumers to that end. WRAP committed to report results in 2019, 2022, 2026 and issue a final report in 2031 against the 50 percent reduction goal.
Canada: In Canada, Kraft Heinz has joined seven other companies in a pledge to reduce food waste in operations by 50 percent by 2025. In 2021, we reduced waste by 25 percent as compared to 2017. Kraft Heinz will use the globally recognized Food Loss and Waste Accounting and Reporting Standard to report our progress. Kraft Heinz Canada is also a member of Loblaw’s 10x20x30 Initiative, a key effort of the Consumer Goods Forum’s global Food Waste Coalition of Action.

In 2021, Kraft Mac & Cheese, a beloved American staple, began developing and testing the brand’s first-ever recyclable fiber-based microwavable cup. The intent of the design change from plastic to fiber is to reduce plastic use and to be both recyclable and compostable in industrial composting facilities. The innovative cup, slated for a pilot launch in 2022, will also eliminate the plastic label through new direct print technology. Kraft is working with outside partners to certify and incorporate the appropriate recycling labeling to help consumers know exactly what to do with the packaging after they have enjoyed their meal.
Once achieved, we anticipate our fiber-based Kraft Mac & Cheese cups will save 60 million KwH of energy per year, the equivalent amount of energy it would take to microwave nearly 1 billion Mac & Cheese meals, while saving the equivalent emissions of driving a typical passenger vehicle 120 times around the Earth. We anticipate the Kraft Mac & Cheese cups will also eliminate approximately 10 million pounds of plastic per year, or approximately a garbage truckload every day.

Designing for Recyclability. 
In Italy, our Plasmon brand launched a fully recyclable baby food pouch in partnership with Gualapack, a leading Italian company specialized in high-performance pouch packaging. The 100 percent fruit snack designed to be good for children, is now also good for the environment. The pouch is designed to be easily recycled in its respective recycling stream, certified by independent institutes HTP Cyclos and Interseroh Dienstleistungs GmbH. This means that after use, pouches can be collected and turned into new nonfood products within a Circular Economy framework. Through this initiative, Plasmon successfully reached 97 percent fully recyclable packaging for its Italian market. Annually, we estimate giving new life to over 270 tons of plastic, which will become new containers, caps, textile fibers, components for cars and household appliances, laboratory equipment and much more.
Kraft Heinz also became a member and supporting partner of the Composting Consortium. Managed by the Center for the Circular Economy at Closed Loop Partners, the Composting Consortium is a multi-year collaboration across the entire compostable packaging value chain to pilot industry-wide solutions and build a roadmap for investment in technologies and infrastructure that enable the recovery of compostable food packaging and food scraps. Launched in November 2021, the consortium brings together leading voices in the composting ecosystem in the United States to identify the best path forward to increase the recovery of compostable food packaging and drive toward circular outcomes.
In 2020, Kraft Heinz completed a pilot project to demonstrate the use of roof board made from recycled flexible film packaging, installing roofing at two Kraft Heinz manufacturing plants. The pilot was made possible through our collaboration with Materials Recovery For the Future (MRFF), a non-profit research collaborative that set out to determine the technical and economic feasibility to collect, sort, bale and recycle flexible plastic packaging. In 2021, we installed more roof board at our Granite City, Illinois facility, increasing the use of postconsumer recycled packaging by 15 times as compared to our 2020 pilot. We look forward to exploring additional ways at scaling innovative packaging solution initiatives like these. Moreover, at Kraft. 
Heinz we are committed to engaging in industry-wide efforts to promote packaging circularity, aiming to strengthen the demand for recycled plastics throughout the supply chain. As such, we are proud inaugural members of the Association of Plastic Recycler’s Residential Film Demand Champion Program.

A More Sustainable Cap. 
The Heinz brand released an innovative and more sustainable cap for its squeezy sauce bottles, made to be fully circular. The unique new cap – made of an innovative single type of material – was created after we invested significant research and development, involving more than 185,000 hours to find a suitable replacement cap for our convenient and extremely popular squeezy bottles, which sold one billion units globally in 2020.
We created 45 different designs in total on the mission to create the new cap, which were printed in-house using a state-of-the-art 3D printer. After creating the prototypes, we then followed a rigorous testing procedure to make sure the cap met the highest quality standards. To date, Heinz sauce bottles have used a flexible valve, which had been designed to deliver the ideal portion of sauce per squeeze but was typically challenging to recycle. The new innovative cap has been designed to provide the same perfect squeeze of your favorite Heinz Tomato Ketchup using a single, rigid and more recyclable material. This resulted in the cap - and the Heinz Tomato Ketchup bottle – being easily and conveniently recycled alongside other household curbside recycling. The first Heinz varieties to get the new cap will be the world’s most-loved ketchup, Heinz Tomato Ketchup, and the popular Heinz BBQ Sauce. The cap is expected to be rolled out globally from 2022, starting in Europe.

APPENDIX ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP RESPONSIBLE SOURCING HEALTHY LIVING & COMMUNITY SUPPORT APPENDIX INTRODUCTION


Supplier Guiding Principles. 
At Kraft Heinz, we recognize our suppliers as partners and want to bring them to the table to advance the sustainability agenda. Our Supplier Guiding Principles (SGPs), which we strengthened in August 2021, apply to our upstream supply chain and clearly define both our minimum requirements, as well as our aspirational destinations, for the conduct and sustainable operation of our supplier network.
Our SGPs are more robust than ever before. The Principles will help us to drive sustainable growth within the organization, mitigate risk and bring value to an array of important stakeholders, while we ensure that we are all doing our parts to create a better, more just world. These principles continue to be included in our standard contract language and are publicly available in 26 languages through our supplier hub.
Our SGPs were developed using industry best practices and internationally recognized standards, including the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the International Bill of Human Rights, and the principles set forth in the International Labor Organization’s (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. In 2021, Kraft Heinz also launched a supplier facing version of its Ownerversity e-learning platform which includes supplier-specific training on the new SGPs. This training is a foundational resource in developing existing suppliers and onboarding new suppliers into the Kraft Heinz ecosystem. The training is available in 6 languages.

Due Diligence Program. 
Our supply chain spans globally and touches the lives of communities around the world. It is our responsibility to make sure the impact of our operations remains a positive one. We take a risk-based approach to Due Diligence aligned with the UN Guiding Principles. This model complements our SGPs and defines how and when risk will be monitored, assessed, and managed. Compliance to our ESG due diligence program, including our right to audit, is a contractual obligation for Kraft Heinz suppliers globally.
We continue to assess risk levels for our key sourcing categories and will continue to increase our audit capabilities and scope over the next few years. Progress on this program will be covered in future reports.
In 2021, Kraft Heinz joined as a member of Sedex and EcoVadis in an effort to align its supplier ESG requirements with industry standards and recognize existing supplier efforts to manage ESG risks. We value impactdriven action and are actively developing our Responsible Sourcing program in a way that harmonizes supplier requirements and reduces administrative burdens on our suppliers – allowing our teams to focus resources on driving ESG improvements in areas that need it most.
61


Human Rights. 
In 2019, Kraft Heinz released a Global Human Rights Policy, which is guided by internationally recognized standards, including the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the International Bill of Human Rights and the principles set forth in the International Labor Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work.
As part of the Global Human Rights Policy, Kraft Heinz requires all employees and related entities, suppliers and business partners to strictly adhere to our human rights standards, which, in summary: • Prohibit child and underage employment • Prohibit trafficking, forced or involuntary prison labor • Prohibit all and any forms of abuse, bribery, harassment and discrimination • Recognize and respect the rights of freedom of association and collective bargaining • Recognize and respect fair, legal and equitable work timeframes, working conditions (including health and safety) and wages • Recognize land rights, natural resources and ensure all workers’ rights to clean water and adequate sanitation facilities • Require all labor recruitment and employment procedures to be carried out in a legal and ethical manner. 
Following the release of the Global Human Rights Policy, Kraft Heinz undertook a global human rights risk assessment with third party assistance. This exercise highlighted relative risk factors by commodity type overlaid with associated geographical risk. The evaluation also included economic and social criteria to determine points in our value chain where risk is highest, and where we could make the greatest impact. The scope of the assessment was all-encompassing – rather than only evaluating specific commodities, we assessed nearly all our ingredient food purchases. This assessment is influencing our plans to continuously develop and improve our due diligence and management programs. We began to develop plans to roll out our two prong approach, working collaboratively with our value chain toward proactive capacity building, identifying areas where we can collectively make improvements, as well as targeting specific elevated-risk procurement categories, with enforcement actions if necessary and segmentation based on: • Type of supplier (Strategic, Core or Transactional) • Risk categories and materiality • Geographic risk integrated with other risk categories. 
As a result of this assessment, we updated our Supplier Guiding Principles in 2021, strengthening the human rights sections, including new risk areas such as land rights, migrant workers, minimum age of employment, fair wages and ethical business practices. In addition to this, we established the ESG Due Diligence and Management Program. This program helps us monitor our supply chain for potential human rights risks and non-compliances with the help of Sedex (direct suppliers) and EcoVadis (indirect suppliers).
Kraft Heinz values all life. We have a zero-tolerance approach to human rights violations across our entire value chain.

Supplier Diversity Program. 
The Kraft Heinz Supplier Diversity program was launched in 2021 as an important step in embedding our company values into our supplier base to better reflect the communities that we serve. Starting with the U.S., the program is intended to play a critical role in addressing systemic barriers which may stand between under-represented groups and the opportunity to be a supplier to Kraft Heinz. Kraft Heinz is committed to the fair inclusion of diverse suppliers in procurement activities and will partner with diverse suppliers that are at least 51 percent owned, operated, and managed by women, people of color, LGBTQ+ people, persons with disabilities, veterans and other recognized minorities, with a goal of tripling spend with such companies by 2025. The company will continue to partner with small businesses and those suppliers certified by the U.S. Small Business Administration’s HUBZone program, which fuels small business growth in historically underutilized business zones.

Palm Oil. 
Kraft Heinz recognizes that unsustainable palm oil production is one of the largest drivers of deforestation globally. We have taken active steps to address these issues in our supply chain. We (including through legacy Heinz prior to 2015) have been a proud member of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) since 2007, a multi-stakeholder nonprofit aimed at uniting all aspects of the palm industry to minimize the negative impacts of palm oil cultivation.
The baseline risk assessment of our direct global palm oil supply chain conducted in 2017 allowed us to identify potential deforestation risks, as well as peatland/biodiversity hotspot encroachment concerns. Direct suppliers were additionally asked to provide information on the country of origin of their palm raw materials, as well as their sustainable/ responsible sourcing policies. Details on their sustainable palm oil objectives and progress were also shared. Suppliers were also asked to provide traceability data for all palm oil mills in their supply chain. The mills’ geographical location in conjunction with a global satellite mapping tool incorporated potential deforestation and other environmentally related risks in the mill sourcing regions. The information obtained from this exercise informed our Global Sustainable Palm Oil Policy, and allowed us to engage our suppliers to discuss any identified risks and develop action plans to manage them.
2007: H.J. Heinz Holding Corporation becomes a member of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil.
2014: Kraft Foods Group, Inc. becomes a member of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil.
2015: Kraft Heinz becomes a member of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil.
2017: Kraft Heinz became a founding member of The North American Sustainable Palm Oil Network.
2018: Kraft Heinz worked with The Rainforest Alliance to expand the scope of our deforestation risk assessment to include global external manufacturing partners.
2019: Kraft Heinz initiates corrective action phase, engaging direct suppliers to address identified risks in their supply chains.
In 2021, we continued to evaluate our supply chain to assess our direct suppliers and evaluate their sustainable palm oil policies, track their progress towards 100 percent traceability to the mill and make sure that they maintain RSPO certification for the products we purchase from them. Moving forward, Kraft Heinz will continue to engage with direct suppliers, external manufacturers, and indirect suppliers to advance our sustainable and traceable palm oil supply. In 2022, Kraft Heinz is committed to advancing our responsible sourcing program to include a no deforestation roadmap, underpinning our slated 2022 release of our Global No Deforestation Policy. We look forward to working with our stakeholders on our policy and expectations, maintaining accountability and increasing transparency.

Our Plasmon brand from Italy is a leader in baby food with a strong ESG mission. The 119-year-old brand sells a range of products, including homogenized baby food, pasta and fruit compote for babies. However, it is best known for its infant biscuits made with powdered milk, vitamins and minerals. Its manifesto, “We grow together, the future of Italy” has been a guiding force in its evolution.
Across its value chain, Plasmon has initiated several sustainability projects. Also of note, in 2019 the brand signed a programbased Memorandum of Understanding with the Italian Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Forestry to drive better traceability of its supply chain and food safety transparency. Included in the memorandum was a commitment to certify the Plasmon supply chain as 100 percent traceable and target 25,000 tons of product to be sourced from Italy by 2025. In 2021, Plasmon increased it supply of Italian raw materials to 20,100 tons. This represented approximately 84 percent of its goal, up from 16,000 tons in 2020, even as it dealt with business impacts of COVID-19. This success was made possible with the collaboration of suppliers and partners such as Inalca, Orogel, Milini Spigadoro, Mila and Coldiretti, who have worked in innovative ways to ensure a steady supply of ingredients for the brand.

Animal Welfare. 
Kraft Heinz believes that animals deserve a good quality of life and to be treated humanely. We have an unwavering commitment to the care of animals in our supply chain. Although we neither own nor manage farms, we align with our suppliers in requiring their animals be treated with care, understanding and respect.
Kraft Heinz believes that good animal welfare includes three elements which guide our animal welfare policies and initiatives: • Health and Productivity: healthy animals that are provided with quality shelter, feed, and water • Emotional Well-Being: negative experiences minimized and positive experiences enhanced • Naturalness: animals perform important species-specific behaviors. 
This concept of animal welfare builds upon the internationally recognized “Five Freedoms” of animal welfare which include the fundamental principles of 1) freedom from hunger and thirst, 2) freedom from physical and thermal discomfort, 3) freedom from pain, injury or disease, 4) freedom to express normal behaviors, and 5) freedom from fear and distress.
We support housing designs that allow animals to perform speciesspecific behaviors. Examples include, but are not limited to, cagefree housing with perches and nest boxes for laying hens and group housing for gestating sows. When painful procedures need to be performed, we encourage pain mitigation, such as the use of anesthetics or analgesics. Kraft Heinz expects its suppliers to implement practices and pursue continuous improvement consistent with the Five Freedoms and good animal welfare.

66. 
Public interest in farming and animal care is increasing and consumers desire farming practices that match their values and expectations. Good animal welfare, environmental sustainability, and healthy people form an interconnected system; and well managed farms reduce waste and provide a safe, nutritious food supply. Knowing this, we integrate science and societal ethics in our animal welfare decisions. In 2021, we released our updated Global Animal Welfare Policy and our inaugural Supplier Implementation Guide which are available on our Supplier Hub.
Animal Welfare Outreach and Education. 
In 2021, we worked with Dr. Kurt Vogel at the University of Wisconsin, River Falls to establish an undergraduate research internship program. The students in this program worked with academic and industry experts to develop supplier questionnaires on dairy calf management, broiler transport, and their swine welfare programs. Our animal welfare specialist partners with suppliers on animal welfare improvement projects, such as developing a customized turkey load-out and transport audit. They serve on the animal welfare committees of the North American Meat Institute and the National Turkey Federation. Within Kraft Heinz, our specialist provides training on farm animal production and welfare to cross-functional team members and leads our ESG Steering Group Subcommittee on Animal Welfare.
Our Supply Partners. 
Our suppliers are our partners in humane animal care and its continuous improvement. We expect suppliers to maintain strict standards of animal care and raise animals in accordance with the laws and ordinances in their locale. We require our suppliers to have a zero-tolerance policy for animal abuse and neglect, and to train all individuals working with or around live animals accordingly. In addition to the Global Animal Welfare Policy, animal welfare expectations are delineated in the Kraft Heinz Ingredient Supplier Quality Expectations Manual and product specifications. When evidence of non-compliance exists, Kraft Heinz may suspend the supplier until corrective actions have been implemented. Suppliers who do not align with the requirements or do not make continuous and positive improvements to meet them risk losing Kraft Heinz as a customer.

Animal Health & Management. 
Laying Hens. 
The ability to engage in normal behaviors such as walking, nesting, and dust-bathing is important to laying hen welfare. Therefore, by 2025 we are globally committed to purchasing only cage-free eggs or better. Kraft Heinz defines “cage-free or better” eggs as sourced from laying hens that come from cage-free, free-range, pasture-raised, or similar natural or open housing settings. Hens in both cage-free and free-range housing are provided with litter, perches and nest boxes. In 2021, 64 percent of the eggs and egg products* we purchased globally were cage-free or better. Whereas in previous years our reporting was limited to internal manufacturing only, for the first time for 2021, we are reporting on progress at both internal and external manufacturing plants that make egg-containing products for us. In Europe, we achieved our goal to exclusively purchase free-range eggs at internal plants by the end of 2020. In the U.S., 100 percent of our cage-free egg supply was certified by American Humane Certified or Certified Humane.
Pigs. 
In accordance with our three elements of animal welfare, we believe that pregnant sows should be safely housed in social groups with enough space to perform normal behaviors. The industry faces challenges to meet the demand, especially for pork that complies with strict regional legislation. Kraft Heinz is working with our pork suppliers to transition pregnant sows from gestation stall housing to group, pen housing. In 2021, 25 percent of our global and 98 percent of our European pork supply came from sows housed in pen gestation systems.
Broiler Chickens. 
We have committed to improving broiler welfare by 2024. We continue to incorporate leading science into our assessment of broiler welfare, while we engage with the industry at-large as it redefines its guidelines for enhanced broiler welfare. We will incorporate a combination of outcome-based and practice-based metrics that are shown to demonstrably increase animal welfare. Targets include stocking density, litter quality, enrichment provision, and controlled atmosphere stunning and will incorporate supplier verification, such as auditing. We continue to engage with our United States supply partners in meeting enhanced broiler chicken welfare standards.
European Chicken Commitment. 
In late 2019, Kraft Heinz expanded its animal welfare commitments to improving chicken welfare by 2026 as part of the European Chicken Commitment. Kraft Heinz continues to assess and work to transition its European supply chain accordingly. Though this commitment faces some challenges related to supply, we remain steadfast in our commitment to require 100 percent of the fresh, frozen and processed chicken in our European supply chain to meet this standard. We look forward to continued engagement with our suppliers toward this objective.
Dairy Cattle. 
We require our U.S. suppliers to follow the National Milk Producers Federation’s Farmers Assuring Responsible Management (FARM) Animal Care guidelines. This program establishes best on-farm animal management practices and includes second-party evaluations and third-party verification. 66 percent of our dairy supply comes from U.S. farms. Our Canadian suppliers follow the National Farm Animal Care Council’s Code of Practice for the Care and Handling of Dairy Cattle. Third-party audits are required to ensure that the U.S. and Canadian programs’ guidelines are followed.
Humane Endings. 
We believe animals should be provided a respectful and humane death. Compromised animals must be euthanized in a timely manner that aligns with the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) or World Organisation for Animal Health’s (WOAH) guidelines. Similarly, slaughter should also align with these guidelines. Efficient stunning prior to slaughter is important for animal welfare. 100 percent of our U.S. Oscar Mayer product suppliers report that they comply with our product specifications which require an annual third-party humane slaughter audit and regular internal animal welfare audits.
Antimicrobials. 
Disease prevention strategies such as husbandry, hygiene, and vaccinations must be the primary defenses against animal disease. However, even with excellent care, farm animals sometimes become ill. When this occurs, antimicrobial treatment (including antibiotics) can be an important component of humane animal care. Therapeutic 67 antimicrobials should only be used after careful review by a veterinarian and treatment limited to ill and at-risk animals, treating the fewest animals possible. Alongside good farm management, responsible antimicrobial use can help protect food quality and enhance safety.
In the United States, where the majority of Kraft Heinz meat ingredients are purchased, we require our suppliers to meet or exceed the AVMA or WOAH guidelines for the judicious use of antimicrobial agents. Our meat and dairy products meet or exceed government regulations related to the use and administration of antimicrobials, including compliance with bans on antibiotics for growth promotion.
Hormones. 
While studies conclude hormone supplements in cattle are safe for animals and for humans, we support ongoing research efforts to further demonstrate the safety and usefulness of supplemental hormones. For example, recombinant bovine somatotropin (rbST) is a hormone that can increase milk production in dairy cattle. Globally its usage varies widely in accordance with government regulations. In the United States, for example, hormones (including rbST) are not allowed to be used for growth promotion in pigs or poultry. In some countries, growth hormones are approved for use in beef and dairy cattle. We do not restrict their use in those instances. However, we support wider, industry initiatives to eliminate rbST from the supply.
Testing of Food Ingredients. 
Kraft Heinz does not support or condone the use of animals for research that is not essential to food safety, and we do not maintain any testing facilities. When required by governmental agencies, ingredient safety testing is completed by accredited third-party facilities following appropriate animal welfare guidelines. We do not support unnecessary testing and are advocates for replacing animal testing with other validated research methods.

Annually, all Kraft Heinz suppliers of animal and animal-derived products are requested to complete an animal welfare risk self-assessment. The assessment was developed by a cross-functional internal panel that included animal welfare, procurement and quality team members and was reviewed by an external team of animal welfare scientists. The assessments review suppliers’ strengths and weaknesses on animal welfare policies, personnel training, transportation, stunning methods and auditing. Kraft Heinz’s animal welfare team works with lower performing suppliers, which make up a small percentage of our total supply chain. Together, they create action plans to develop policies and procedures that improve animal welfare. Low performing suppliers unwilling or unable to improve animal welfare may jeopardize their status as Kraft Heinz suppliers.
Results of our 2021 assessment are listed below and more details can be found on page 76. In 2021, we also began to develop a robust farm-level animal welfare audit program across our key animal commodities in line with industry leading frameworks.

Sustainable Agriculture. 
As a food and beverage company, we recognize the importance of sustainable agriculture in all of our products. Through the work of our experienced agronomists and procurement teams, we are proud to work with our suppliers to advance sustainable agriculture practices, knowing that these commodities are integral to our business and to the well-being of our consumers and communities in which we operate.
At Kraft Heinz, we have a long history of working with growers to promote sustainable agricultural practices, such as implementing rotational crops to promote multigenerational fields, to increase yield at the field and in processing, adoption of next generation breeding through our seed business, and finding ways to help increase water efficiency.
Through thorough research in our laboratories and with experienced agronomist teams on the ground, we strive to stay at the forefront of sustainable agriculture, applying what we learn through trialing and demonstration to additional parts of our business. The Kraft Heinz Sustainable Agriculture Practices Manual forms the foundation of our engagement strategy with growers, as we work towards our 2025 goal to source 100 percent of tomatoes for Heinz Tomato Ketchup sustainably. We aim to dig deep in our roots to use 150 years of forward-looking, responsible agricultural and human rights practices to build on our agricultural legacy with our farmers. We are committed to further building on our strong sustainability heritage, as Henry J. Heinz (founder of the H.J. Heinz Company) famously noted, “Protect the consumer by owning the product all the way from the soil to the table.” 69.

Sustainable Agricultural Practices Manual. 
Sustainable farming practices do more than save important natural resources. They also have the potential to considerably increase crop yields and provide growers and their families with greater economic opportunity. Kraft Heinz has taken significant steps to strengthen our Sustainable Agriculture Practices Manual (SAP) and is working in partnership with growers to implement those practices.
In 2021, we launched our Sustainable Agricultural Practices Manual with suppliers and growers in both Spain and California, key growing regions for Heinz tomatoes. In the coming years, we plan to roll out audit programs to ensure supplier compliance with these standards and will be expanding the scope of our sustainable agricultural program to navy beans.
Building the Regenerative Capacity of Agriculture Through a Global, Farmer-Centered, Industry-led Initiative.
The long-term resilience of agriculture now depends on how quickly we can develop regenerative practices that benefit soil health, biodiversity, water supply, climate resilience and livelihoods.
In late 2021, Kraft Heinz, along with approximately 30 companies from across the agricultural value chain, became a founding member of SAI Platform’s new Regenerative Agriculture Programme. The purpose of the program is to build industry alignment, reduce duplication and amplify impact through the creation of a universal framework with locally implementable indicators, to ensure accessibility and applicability of regenerative agriculture principles, practices and outcomes on farm. The program will work to scientifically validate regenerative principles, engage with farmers and develop a mechanism for corporations to verify and communicate regenerative targets to external stakeholders.
“As we develop and define new regenerative agriculture approaches, it is the farmer’s inherent knowledge of the land, its constraints and opportunities, that is critical to ensuring successful social and environmental outcomes based on solid economic foundations.” – Martina Henry, Director, Agriculture Sustainability, Kraft Heinz and SAI Platform Regenerative Agriculture Programme Steering Committee Co-chair.

FSA 3.0 Benchmark Equivalence for Sustainable Agriculture Practices Manual. 
In 2021, our Sustainable Agricultural Practices Manual was benchmarked against SAI Platform’s Farm Sustainability Assessment (FSA) 3.0 and received ‘Silver Level equivalence’. This was the first sustainability program successfully benchmarked against the updated FSA 3.0 which was released in April 2021.
We believe this benchmark will help us and our suppliers in our journey towards purchasing 100 percent sustainably-sourced Heinz ketchup tomatoes by 2025. It provides a pathway for growers to demonstrate compliance with our requirements, while also offering a single, industryaligned tool that reduces duplication and audit-fatigue. This allows growers to focus on improving their operations and continuing to grow the quality, sustainable ingredients we rely on to produce our brands.
“FSA 3.0 marks a step-up in the benchmarking program’s integrity, yet it is even more straightforward and easier to get started. It is great to see The Kraft Heinz Company getting the most out of their membership with Sustainable Agriculture Initiative (SAI) Platform by using the FSA to refine, communicate and scale their program. We congratulate them on this achievement!” – Joe Rushton, FSA Director at SAI Platform 70

Sustainable Dairy Partnership. 
Kraft Heinz is a proud, engaged member of SAI Platform’s Sustainable Dairy Partnership (SDP). Developed through a multi-stakeholder process that included dairy processors, industry associations, and dairy buyers, SDP was created with the goal of driving continuous improvement in dairy sustainability. To achieve this goal, the SDP allows processors to leverage work already being done as part of industry sustainability initiatives, national programs, voluntary certifications and regulatory compliance. This drives greater efficiency and avoids duplication of effort. As a member of this organization, we are committed to engaging and learning more, in order to continue to drive sustainability within our dairy supply chain.
Celebrating the Tomato with the Community at our Pudliszki Facility. 
Our Pudliszki, Poland facility revived its annual Grower Open Day in 2021, having pivoted to an online format at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. This event brought together 500 growers and their families from across the region, along with other industry stakeholders. The event showcased the results of large-scale variety trials of both Heinz and non-Heinz seeds, to share industry best-practices through demonstrations and field trials. Grower Open Day also included a presentation of best-in-class agricultural practices through its celebration of the tomato, with community competitions for best tomato fruits and tomato-based meals, firmly placing Pudliszki at the center of the local community.
The Pudliszki facility was also separately recognised as the Best Processor in 2021 by BASF’s Nunhems® brand and the Polish Tomato Producer’s Association’s Agro Academy Awards. We received this award for our strong focus on innovation, large-scale tomato trials in Poland, close relationships with growers and for implementing better soil preparation practices to increase resilience during drought conditions. In addition, Elwira and Leszek Chudziak, tomato producers for our Pudliszki facility, won the award for most innovative grower based on their improvements to the nursery and farm operations. Elwira and Leszek’s farm was first started with the support of Kraft Heinz’s lead agronomist for Pudliszki, Slawomir Paszkier.

Supporting Farm Resilience in California. 
As part of our ongoing commitment to continuous improvement on farm, in 2021 we introduced a pilot cover crop program with our California tomato growers. The objective of the pilot is to incentivize the adoption of cover crops as a practice that can help promote soil health, enhance water-holding capacity, reduce reliance on chemical inputs, and support biodiversity while increasing yields. In 2021, 2,279 acres of cover crops were planted by our California growers and we have a target to grow this to more than 5,000 acres in 2022.

At Kraft Heinz, we recognize that we cannot succeed in our ESG journey alone. Therefore, we are committed to bringing bold, innovative, and like-minded partners ’Together at the Table’ to help lead the way.
Bowles Farming Company is a key global tomato supplier for many of our well-loved brands, including the iconic Heinz tomato ketchup. As a 160-year-old family-run farm, Bowles understands the importance of sustainable and regenerative agriculture. Their philosophy centers around stewardship and farming with the natural world in focus.
Bowles is adjacent to the second largest contiguous wetland in the U.S. To help preserve this area of great biodiversity value, they own and manage 650 acres of wetland within their boundary and work with a wide range of stakeholders to maintain these lands. These initiatives include native plant cultivation to help pollinators and beneficial insects thrive around the farm. Recognizing a shortage. 
SUPPLIER SPOTLIGHT Bowles Farming Company. 
Together at the Table: Kraft Heinz 2022 ESG Report of native materials in their community, Bowles also set up the Great Valley Seed company to ensure that local communities have access to these essential seeds. Today, they grow over 50 species that can be used in restoration and pollinator support programs. The farm also operates drip irrigation systems powered by their on-site solar farm and composting projects utilizing feedstock from their local communities to further increase farm resilience and circularity.
In addition to caring for the environment, farm leadership actively supports the safety, health and education of their employees and the surrounding community. Most notably, Bowles implemented the BF Scholars program in 2015 to support the educational journeys of their employees’ children.
As a proud customer, we applaud Bowles Farm’s leadership in advancing sustainable agriculture. We are excited to continue bringing them and other like-minded suppliers ‘Together at the Table’ to drive ESG progress.
“From our vantage point here on the farm, we see the word “sustainability” widely used but not often backed up with strong evidence. We value collaborative relationships with supply chain partners that want to provide consumers with true stories of sustainable production that consumers can trust and feel good about. Kraft Heinz is one of those key partners who take the time to visit the farm and partner in our journey to produce products in a way that authentically supports people and the planet. We value our relationship with Kraft Heinz and admire their leadership in true sustainability.” – Cannon Michael, President and CEO, Bowles Farming Company Bowles receives organic waste from their local communities that is then converted into certified organic compost. They use most of this compost on their farm, which improves soil quality and water retention, and reduces the amount of nitrogen fertilizer needed in its operations.
