A message from Rodney Sacks and Hilton Schlosberg. 
We are pleased to present Monster Beverage. 
Corporation’s (“Monster”) Sustainability Report for 2021.
It was an exciting year for us, thanks to the hard work of the Monster Family, and we’re proud of the progress of our sustainability program. Despite the challenges posed by the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, we have thrived over the past year.
In 2021, meaningful efforts were made to measure and report energy use and greenhouse gas emis- sions across our value chain. Building upon these efforts, we are committed to setting a target by the end of 2023 to reduce our environmental impacts.
In addition, planning began across our facilities to test and implement additional energy efficien- cy solutions. Plans for the new American Fruits & Flavors LLC (AFF) production facility include a combined heat and power system partially fueled by solar energy and biogas from an anaerobic digester, as well as ENERGY STAR® and LEED™
Certification. By 2023, solar panels will be installed on our Corona, CA, headquarters buildings and on our 1,000,000-square-foot Monster Energy ware- house in Rialto, CA. These projects demonstrate our commitment to a sustainable future.
Our commitment to a sustainable future is further demonstrated through our products you see in the marketplace. We have committed to supplying our vendors with ENERGY STAR certified refriger- ation equipment. In 2021, 97 percent of Monster products were packaged in 100 percent recyclable aluminum cans.
In 2021, we welcomed Tiffany M. Hall and Ana. 
Demel to our Board of Directors. Our Equality,
Diversity and Inclusion councils have raised aware- ness and reinforced our values throughout the organization. We supported our local communities through impactful organizations like the United. 
Service Organization (USO) and Thanks USA, through our amazing Monster athletes and their charities, and with the generosity of Monster team members volunteering their time around the world.
As we welcome CANarchy into the fold, we’re excited for the changes they’ll bring. We’re also continuing to work with our distributors, bottlers and co-packers to measure their sus- tainability performance through the use of Ec- oBeast™, our centralized environmental, social and governance (ESG) software platform. These programs are helping us set a solid foundation for transparency, accountability and goal-set- ting in the future.
Our commitment to building a more sustain- able future is a driving force at Monster. We’re grateful to everyone in the Monster family for continuing to inspire and lead us on this jour- ney. Thank you all for your dedication.
Sincerely,
Rodney Sacks and Hilton Schlosberg Co-Chief Executive Officers.

This report refers to certain requirements of the sustainability and reporting framework, the Sustain- ability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) for the. 
Non-Alcoholic Beverages Industry of the Food and. 
Beverage sector. Monster is committed to incor- porating the Task Force for Climate-related Finan- cial Disclosures (TCFD) framework in next year’s sustainability report.
Unless otherwise noted, any reported data and activities cover the 2021 calendar year relating to. 
Monster Beverage Corporation and its consolidat- ed subsidiaries (together referred to as Monster in this report).
In 2021, Monster did not manufacture any of its finished products. Instead, we outsourced pro- duction to third-party bottlers and co-packers. As in previous years, Monster engaged with select bottling and supply partners regarding a broad range of sustainability metrics, goals and perfor- mance related to their activities with Monster, in order to better understand ESG impacts beyond our own direct operations. Highlights are included throughout this report, and we look forward to communicating our progress on such engagements in future years.
In late 2021, Monster also conducted a review of commercially-available ESG software to enhance data collection and analysis. As a result, we en- gaged a leading ESG software developer who created a bespoke data collection tool for Mon- ster: EcoBeast™. EcoBeast™ will allow us to mea- sure and manage ESG data for our bottlers and co-packers, as well as our own operations. Monster is committed to obtaining supplier metrics through. 
EcoBeast™, starting in late 2022 and continuing in 2023.
On February 17, 2022, we completed the acqui- sition of CANarchy Craft Brewery Collective LLC (CANarchy), a craft beer and hard seltzer company.
CANarchy will function independently, retaining its own organizational structure. This report does not cover CANarchy’s ESG activities, as the acquisition closed in the 2022 calendar year. We recognize that our growth into alcoholic beverages brings new responsibilities, and we will address these issues in future reports.
The inclusion of information in this report should not be construed as a characterization regarding the materiality or financial impact of that informa- tion in accordance with the securities laws or any other laws of the United States or any other juris- diction. For additional information regarding Mon- ster Beverage Corporation, please see our filings (including our Form 10-K and Forms 10-Q) with the United States Securities and Exchange Com- mission (SEC).

Outsourced Manufacturing Operations. 
In 2021, as in previous years, we did not oper- ate our own manufacturing facilities for finished goods, but rather outsourced the manufacturing process for finished goods to third-party bottlers and contract packers throughout the U.S. and abroad, under separate arrangements with each party. Our products were generally manufactured regionally in domestic and international locations, in or near the markets where they are sold. This strategy reduces freight costs and transporta- tion-related product damages, as well as our carbon footprint.
While we aim to keep manufacturing and sales within the same regions, due to supply chain issues that occurred throughout 2021, some aluminum cans were imported to meet regional demand. In addition, in 2021, some manufacturing had to take place outside of certain sales regions to satisfy consumer demand, which led to less efficiency.
We own our primary flavor supplier, AFF, which manufactures flavors and concentrates for many of our beverages. We also procure flavors and other raw materials, such as concentrates, sweeteners, sugar, tea, cocoa, juices and other ingredients from third party suppliers. In addition, we obtain packaging materials such as aluminum cans, bot- tles, caps, labels, trays and boxes from third-par- ty suppliers, which are delivered to our various third-party bottlers and co-packers.
In some cases, certain common supplies may be purchased by third-party bottlers and co-packers.
Water and other ingredients may be added into our approved containers for the manufacture of the finished products in accordance with our rec- ipes and formulas. Depending on the beverage, carbonation may also be added.
We also have agreements with bottlers/distribu- tors to distribute our products. All distribution ter- ritories in the U.S. and the majority of distribution territories internationally have been transitioned to The Coca-Cola Company® system of bottlers/ distributors.
As a result, Monster relies in large part on The. 
Coca-Cola Company system of bottlers/distribu- tors and other third parties for certain information in this report. We also engage with these third parties in their sustainability efforts.

We are reporting environmental metrics and initia- tives from not only our own operations, but also our key bottling and supply partners as determined by our ongoing engagement with them.
As in previous years, we outsourced the manufac- turing process for finished goods to third-party bottlers and contract packers in 2021. This Environ- mental Section includes metrics and initiatives from our key bottling and supply partners as determined by our ongoing engagement with them. Many of our ingredient, commodity and packaging suppli- ers and bottling partners have robust sustainable agriculture policies and programs. As we enhance data collection in our supply chain through EcoBe- ast™, we aim to better understand these programs and the environmental impacts in our supply chain.
Increasing Sustainability Awareness from Within. 
ONE OF THE WAYS WE KEEP OURSELVES INFORMED ON SUSTAINABILITY IS THROUGH OUR INTERNAL GLOBAL WEEKLY NEWSLETTER, THE MONSTER ENERGY SUSTAINABILITY DIGEST. THE NEWSLETTER FEATURES TRENDS, NEWS AND INNOVATIONS IN SUSTAINABILITY ISSUES SUCH AS WATER, RECYCLING AND CLIMATE CHANGE.

OPERATIONS MANUFACTURING STRATEGY. 
Monster’s ingredients and products often travel long distances, as our freight partners transport them from procurement sites to separate manu- facturing, co-packing, bottling or distribution sites.
Longer miles spent on the road can equate to high- er costs and negative environmental impacts.
Our Solution. 
We’ve regionalized manufacturing operations to reduce costs and the number of miles traveled. This way, we improved service by providing products closer to our customers while offering the same high quality in a resource efficient manner.
While we aim to keep manufacturing and sales within the same regions, we do note that, due to supply chain issues and increasing consumer demand, we were not able to do so consistently in certain regions in 2021. We are working to become more efficient by engaging in the following proj- ects.
RECENT PROJECTS: › Q4 2020: We reallocated production for South- east Asia from EMEA and North America to. 
Malaysia.
› 2021: We transitioned to local production for products in South Africa, dramatically reducing shipping distances for finished products.
2022 PROJECTS: › In North America, we have ongoing water con- servation projects related to our operating and cleaning practices.
› Globally, we anticipate producing more than 75 percent of our products locally.
› Our can manufacturing network is transitioning to a regional operating model in North America (2022) and EMEA (2023).
› In addition, we are planning to test electric fleet vehicles as part of our efforts to improve efficien- cy, reduce air pollution and decrease our carbon footprint.
EVENTS:
Whenever possible, the team works with event partners and venues in EMEA to run Monster events as carbon neutral and may buy into venue or event series carbon offset programs when avail- able.

SUPPORTiNG “THE THREE R’S”
SPOTLiGHT ON OUR HEADQUARTERS. 
Committed to the principles of reduce, reuse and recycle, Monster encourages all team members to make resource-conscious decisions.
Reduce › U.S. — Our corporate headquarters has histor- ically partnered with Inland Empire (IE) Com- muter, a commute incentivization/carpooling program of the Riverside County Transportation. 
Commission and San Bernardino County Trans- portation Authority. Because of the ongoing. 
COVID-19 pandemic, the program was paused since many of our offices remained closed or had reduced occupancy during 2021. However, we continue to explore ways to reduce our carbon footprint associated with employee commuting.
› EMEA – The team is working to change all light- ing to light-emitting diode (LEDs) with timers and movement sensors which will help reduce unnecessary energy and electricity consumption.
This has already been completed in our Corona offices.

Reuse › U.S. — Our kitchens have switched from polysty- rene to recyclable containers, and almost all our single-use tableware is compostable. In 2021, we installed refillable water stations at our Coro- na offices so that team members can fill their reusable water bottles throughout the day. This project is estimated to eliminate over 750,000 plastic bottles annually and will help transition the elimination of single-use plastic water bottles on our corporate site. We plan to expand upon this in 2022 by providing all office-based team members in North America with refillable water containers.
› EMEA — Our U.K. team has developed several environmentally conscious initiatives that incor- porate sustainable sourcing and the principles of reuse, reduce and recycle. For example, the team salvages cardboard from inbound shipments or waste products (e.g., bean bags) to use for outbound shipments in instances where reused packaging is acceptable. The team also uses pressed wood pallets that are made from recycla- ble materials.

Recycle › U.S. – At our corporate headquarters, recycling bins are available throughout our offices to en- sure easy, proper disposal of recyclable materi- als. As part of our commitment to sustainability, we also started an electronic waste (e-waste) collection drive. In 2021, our corporate head- quarters recycled 9,365 lbs. of e-waste ranging from batteries to laptops and printers.
› We have recycled the following materials at our. 
Rialto warehouse in 2021: › Corrugated boxes: 250,257 lbs.
› Plastic pallet wrap: 22,570 lbs.
› Scrap metal: 7,960 lbs.
› Wood pallets: 2,352 lbs.
› EMEA — The team sources cardboard packag- ing that uses plain print, which increases ease of recycling, and newly sourced boxes are made from recycled material. Likewise, packaging pea- nuts used by the team are now biodegradable and made from recycled material.

The largest building at our corporate headquarters in Corona, California, is LEED and ENERGY STAR certified. The second largest building at our cor- porate headquarters is currently pursuing ENERGY. 
STAR certification. Our Southern California ware- house and distribution center in Rialto, California, is certified LEED Silver.
As part of our benchmarking efforts for ENERGY. 
STAR certification of our facilities, we have installed energy-efficient lighting and control systems, upgraded our heating, ventilation and air condi- tioning (HVAC) systems and installed commercial window film shades.
In line with our vision to minimize our environmen- tal impact, we have taken steps to incorporate the use of renewable energy. With the increase in use of electric vehicles, we operate electric vehicle charging stations at both our corporate head- quarters and our warehouse in Rialto, California; specifically, we currently have 7 charging stations at our Corona headquarters and are planning to have 22 more by 2023. We are also implementing a project to install solar panels and solar-powered electric vehicle chargers at our corporate head- quarters with the aim of installing solar panels for our Rialto, Corona and AFF sites by 2023.
All new U.S. Monster Energy beverage cooling equipment is HFC-free and ENERGY STAR rated; additionally, whenever equipment is retired, the metal is recycled and refrigerants are captured as mandated by regulatory guidelines.
Collaborating with equipment suppliers as well as researching and implementing innovative ways to reduce energy use is an essential part of our future sustainability efforts. We recognize that we still have a tremendous opportunity to further reduce the climate impact of our equipment and will continue to push our energy conservation efforts forward.

OUR SOLAR PROJECT. 
In 2021, Monster approved a project to install solar panels on the Corona headquarters build- ings, Rialto warehouse and new AFF San Fer- nando site. With an expected capacity of 3.46 megawatts, the system will save approximately 4,100 metric tons (MT) carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in annual GHG emissions. This projected reduction represents over 88 percent of total. 
Scope 2 emissions for all Monster direct opera- tions in 2021.
We also plan to install 22, Level 2 solar electric car charging stations at the Corona headquarters site.

ENERGY USE. 
We consume electricity in our buildings in many ways, including lighting, climate control and equip- ment use. Other direct and indirect energy sources, such as natural gas, diesel and propane, are used to heat our buildings, power equipment and run our vehicle fleet. When calculating our global en- ergy consumption from direct and indirect sources, we used utility invoices for electricity and natural gas consumption and transactional records for fuel consumption. For sites in which square footage data was unavailable, we have applied an average square footage by facility type to estimate the size of the facility before estimating the energy consumption.
We have estimated the direct and indirect en- ergy consumption for approximately half of our sites due to unavailability of data. We have also recalculated our energy consumption for 2020 to be consistent with our current calculation methodology. On this basis, direct and indirect energy consumption decreased. While office closures from the ongoing COVID-19 pandem- ic have contributed to a decrease in energy consumption at our office sites, our updated methodology has provided us with a more accurate estimation of year-over-year energy consumption changes.
The Importance of Data: Spotlight on EcoBeast™
FOR US, MEANINGFUL ACTION BEGINS WITH ESTABLISHING BASELINES. THAT IS WHY WE ARE WORKING TO ROLL OUT ECOBEAST™, OUR CENTRALIZED DATA COLLECTION SOFTWARE, ACROSS OUR DIRECT OPERATIONS AND SUPPLY CHAIN IN ORDER TO COLLECT ACCURATE, RELEVANT METRICS ON ESG TOPICS SUCH AS EMISSIONS, ENERGY AND WATER USAGE, HEALTH AND SAFETY, AND OTHER KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS.

WATER USAGE, MANAGEMENT AND STEWARDSHiP. 
Water is the number one ingredient in all Monster products. At Monster, water is more than just an invaluable natural resource; it is at the very core of our business.
As Monster continues to grow, we must ensure that all new facilities are designed with significant water efficiency features — as is the case with our new. 
AFF production facility in San Fernando — while we continue to minimize waste in our existing loca- tions.
Most of our bottling partners have leading edge programs to reduce the use of water in agriculture, packaging and finished product manufacturing; we continue to encourage this, and indeed learn from them.
We recognize that access to clean, safe drinking water is under growing threat from California’s on- going drought; therefore, we must aim to become better stewards of our water use across our busi- ness, in the supply chain and in our personal lives and encourage our key suppliers to do the same.
iN OUR OPERATiONS. 
We participate in various water conservation pro- grams sponsored by the city of Corona in order to expand water conservation efforts in a manner that positively affects our surrounding community.
These programs include initiatives such as installa- tion of low-flow toilets and minimizing the use of water for landscape irrigation. We are continually assessing the risks due to water scarcity in the state of California, and water optimization and conser- vation will continue to be a key component of our sustainability strategy and goals. Monster will work to include water risk information in our reporting in the future (SASB FB-NB-140a.2).
Since moving to our current corporate headquar- ters in 2013, we have improved our ability to monitor water consumption and have implement- ed technologies to reduce on-site water usage. In 2016, we installed water efficiency technologies.

Our buildings also use high-efficiency irrigation systems, xeriscaping principles, low-flow hand sinks and optimized restroom fixtures (SASB. 
FB-NB-140a.2).
At AFF, water use is tracked for total volume con- sumption and is broken down into three usages: (i) finished product usage, (ii) effluent water and (iii) process equipment water consumable for boilers, cooling towers and refrigeration condensers. Be- cause of the nature of AFF’s business, it does not use recycled water in its facilities and instead uses 100 percent source municipal water from the city of Los Angeles. Water quality is checked through both in-house testing and use of annual water quality reports for the Los Angeles County Water- works District. Effluent parameters, such as pH and total discharge, are also monitored.
AFF - A Cycle of Efficiency. 
AS PART OF THE RESOURCE-EFFICIENT DESIGN, OUR NEW AFF PRODUCTION FACILITY WILL INCLUDE AN ANAEROBIC FLUIDIZED BED DIGESTER SYSTEM. THIS INNOVATIVE SYSTEM IS EXPECTED TO REDUCE THE BIOLOGICAL OXYGEN DEMAND (BOD) LEVELS BY 80 PERCENT AND TOTAL SUSPENDED SOLIDS (TSS) BY AS MUCH AS 50 PERCENT FROM WASTEWATER. A COMBINED HEAT AND POWER SYSTEM PRODUCING ELECTRICITY AND STEAM FOR USE WITHIN THE AFF FACILITY WILL BE PARTIALLY FUELED FROM BIOGAS GENERATED BY THE ANAEROBIC FLUIDIZED BED DIGESTER SYSTEM AND WILL ULTIMATELY HELP REDUCE GHG EMISSIONS AS WELL, CREATING A CYCLE OF EFFICIENCY THROUGHOUT ITS OPERATIONS. THE WASTEWATER FROM THE FACILITY WILL BE PROCESSED BY AN ANAEROBIC DIGESTER BEFORE BEING DISCHARGED TO THE CITY WASTEWATER TREATMENT SYSTEM. IN THE FUTURE, ADDITIONAL FILTRATION PROCESSES MAY BE EVALUATED FOR POTENTIAL USE AS GRAY WATER FOR LANDSCAPE IRRIGATION AND OTHER EXTERNAL USES.

APPROACH TO OUR WATER ACCOUNTiNG. 
Monster completed its annual water inventory for direct operations for 2021. Some of our sites — mainly our AFF production facilities — have metered water withdrawal and discharge. For these facilities, usage is based on empirical data from utility bills. To estimate water withdrawal and discharge at our non-metered sites, we calculated the average intensity based on square footage and facility type (e.g., production fa- cility or office) using data from our metered sites. We were able to improve the quality of our data this year, and we aim to keep improving in future years.

WATER GOALS. 
We are committed to setting a water-related goal and policy by the end of 2023 with the aim to increase measurement of our water-related impacts by improving our water data, including reaching out to suppliers, co-packers and bottlers on their water use information.
Implementing EcoBeast™ will allow us to better understand the water usage, risk, and initiatives in. 
Monster’s value chain, and ultimately identify areas of best practice and opportunities for improve- ment.
WATER RiSK ASSESSMENT. 
Water is a key ingredient in our products, and we are taking measures to ensure its responsible stewardship. We are taking a variety of actions to understand the water-related risks within both our direct and indirect operations.
In Our Operations. 
To better understand our water impacts, we have conducted a water risk assessment covering our direct operations using credible, publicly available tools such as the WWF Water Risk Filter and the. 
World Resources Institute (WRI) Aqueduct tool.
These tools allow us to assess how water risk and water stress occurring at the baseline level may affect operations and evaluate risk over a variety of factors, including physical, regulatory and reputa- tional indicators. A total of 66 domestic and inter- national sites within our operational control were assessed using the geographic coordinates of each site as inputs. Excluding AFF, the sites considered were non-manufacturing and were limited only to sites that are considered employee workspaces (e.g., offices). The scope also did not include sites within our operational control that had a high likeli- hood of no water usage (e.g., storage containers).
Findings from the assessment showed that a few. 
AFF sites in Southern California and Monster sites and offices in India and Brazil operate in areas with high water stress. We have made investments in water-efficient equipment for AFF (SASB FB-NB- 140a.2), and we plan to improve upon our data col- lection efforts to further validate the results of our water risk assessment. This assessment will serve as an important step in identifying specific water risk sources within our operations so that Monster can better mitigate and manage our water footprint (SASB FB-NB-140a.2).
In Our Supply Chain. 
A substantial component of our water footprint comes from indirect water use consumed in the manufacture of our products. One of the ways we manage these risks is by requiring suppliers to adhere to the Supplier Code of Conduct (SASB. 
FB-NB-140a.2). In 2021, we began initial assess- ments of our water-related trends in our supply chain through publicly available reports, data and tools. We conducted a water risk assessment on our co-packer and bottler facilities located in the. 
EMEA using the WRI Aqueduct tool and the WWF. 
Water Risk Filter. Out of the 21 sites assessed, 8 sites were identified to be in high water risk areas.
To address water stewardship opportunities and water-related risks, our EMEA team has created a cross-functional water team, and we will continue to work closely with our bottling partners to drive increased water efficiency.
Monster is committed to expanding our water risk assessment to include CANarchy and all of our bottling and co-packer partners. Partner Insights:

The Coca-Cola Company. 
In 2021, The Coca-Cola Company adopted a comprehensive water security strategy to ensure the availability of a sufficient quantity and quality of water, access to safe water services and effective governance of shared water resources.
Other 2021 highlights include: › Coca-Cola Europacific Partners reduced their water use per liter of product produced in Europe by 13 percent compared to 2010 levels.
› All Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Partners facilities that produce for Monster were certified to the Alliance for Water Stewardship standard.
› Coca-Cola FEMSA replenished 109 percent of the water that they used to manufacture beverages back to nature.
› The Coca-Cola Company is participating in a unique private-public water conservation partnership as a member of the California Water Action Collaborative. A water leak-detection project, which is focused on a 183-unit low-income housing project for seniors in central Los Angeles, is expected to save millions of gallons of water annually.

Working Together on Water. 
Although many of our offices remained closed throughout 2021, that did not stop us from seek- ing everyday solutions on how we can positively contribute to solving water-related issues. In 2021, for the first time, Monster engaged with Living. 
Lands & Waters, a nonprofit that aids in the pro- tection, preservation and restoration of the natural environment of the nation’s major rivers and their watersheds. We donated to the organization with the support of our employee match program and allowed our employees to use their Volunteer Time. 
Off day to participate in river and shore clean-up activities. In addition, on Earth Day, Living Lands &
Waters Founder and President, Chad Pregracke, spoke to our company team members as part of our Monster speaker series.
Following the devastating Huntington Beach oil spill, we donated funds to the Wetlands and Wild- life Care Center to assist with the rehabilitation and release of injured and orphaned native wildlife.
For the 2021 World Oceans Day, EMEA teams worked with our bottling partner, Coca-Cola. 
European Partners, on their project Mares Circu- lares, or “Circular Seas.” A total of 97 employees across nine countries spent the day participating in marine clean-ups to help protect our oceans from plastic pollution. Over 300 kilograms of waste was collected in Spain alone as part of this initiative.
U.S. teams were also involved in World Oceans. 
Day clean-ups, with 25 team members working at the Chattahoochee River in Atlanta and five more at the Ohio River in Louisville. Additionally, we de- veloped a video with the theme, What Does Water. 
Mean to You? to encourage team members to think consciously about this resource, and shared water efficiency tips that could be easily implemented at home, including information on incentives offered by local government and utilities for water-efficient equipment purchases.

REPORTiNG AND DiSCLOSURE. 
CLiMATE CHANGE RiSK. 
Monster identifies, evaluates and manages fluctu- ating corporate-level risks through assessment and business continuity plans. Each business division assesses risk relative to its own range of business activities and has its own definition of what may be considered a substantive risk in their specific area.
Generally, climate-related risks are assessed in the same way that business-level risks are identified and managed.
As climate change continues to be a pressing issue for us and for many stakeholders and communities worldwide, Monster plans to conduct a climate-re- lated scenario analysis within the coming years to better gauge how climate change affects our direct and indirect operations. We plan to share more on this topic in future reports.
CDP DiSCLOSURE. 
CDP is one of the premier frameworks for com- panies to disclose information on climate change, water security and forest-related metrics, impacts, risks and opportunities.
In 2021, Monster completed its second CDP disclo- sures for both the Climate Change and Water Se- curity programs. Our scores of Awareness for both programs represent our knowledge of, and our impact on, climate change and water issues. We recognize these efforts as a significant step in our sustainability journey and have continued reporting to these programs in 2022.
Our bottling and distribution partners, such as. 
Asahi Group Holdings, The Coca-Cola Company,
Coca-Cola Amatil, Coca-Cola Europacific Partners,
Coca-Cola Hellenic, Coca-Cola FEMSA and Co- ca-Cola Içeck, are also CDP-participating compa- nies and disclosed their climate and water data in 2021. Many have achieved Leadership or Man- agement level scores for their performance and actions.

All full-time, part-time and temporary Monster team members are covered under occupational injury and illness programs or workers’ compensation insurance.
We aim to foster a workplace that is free from vi- olence, harassment, intimidation and other unsafe or disruptive conditions due to internal or exter- nal threats. We are committed to providing fair and equitable remediation should circumstances require.
Our subsidiary, AFF, coordinates with the Occu- pational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) on a regular basis to ensure a safe and healthful workplace. AFF also has several training programs in place that promote a safe environment, cover- ing topics such as hearing conservation, confined space entry and proper operation of heavy machin- ery.
COVID-19 Safety. 
From the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in. 
March 2020, our top priority has been the health, safety and well-being of our team members. In 2021, we continued to implement global trav- el restrictions and work-from-home policies for team members who were able to work remotely.
Where possible, team members were provided with equipment to facilitate home-based work. For team members who were unable to work remotely, we implemented safety precautions which were developed and adopted in line with guidance from public health authorities and professional consul- tants in the relevant countries. For example, where possible, we provided on-site COVID-19 testing for team members at select offices and facilities.
On June 1, 2021, we instituted a phased return to in-person work for office-based team members at our corporate headquarters. During the first phase, the following initiatives went into effect: › Team members who were fully vaccinated in the. 
U.S. and U.K. had the option to return to the office.
› Details of our COVID-19 safety protocols were provided to team members.

EMPLOYEE TRAiNiNG AND DEVELOPMENT. 
Monster empowers team members to perform at their highest potential. To foster this growth, we offer many opportunities for team members to take their skills and careers to the next level.
Mentorship. 
We offer mentorship programs which are de- signed to inspire, motivate and guide talent within our operations. From 2020 to 2021 alone,
Monster saw a 25 percent increase in the num- ber of program participants in the Americas,
APAC and LATAM regions. Approximately 600 team members participated in this program in 2021. During the fourth quarter of 2021, a global committee reviewed all steps in the annual mentor program with the aim to enhance the program.
In December 2021, the committee provided final recommendations for 2022, including the addition of EDI criteria in the application process and the inclusion of peer-to-peer mentoring for new hires to accelerate the onboarding process.
Monster Business Academy. 
The Monster Business Academy provides team members with access to numerous online, self- paced, on-demand courses and training programs, as well as leadership training sessions designed to build management and professional skills. In 2021, 22 team members participated in the program at. 
Vanderbilt or Cornell University with the aim to promote fresh perspectives for our organization’s future success. In a feedback survey sent out to participants after the program’s completion, 92 percent of respondents stated that they are likely to recommend the program to other members of the Monster Family.
Great job putting it all together and tailoring it to the Monster team. It is not easy to bring all the egos, palates, opinions, (and) experience levels together and adding in outside influences like professors and other companies. Overall, it was a fantastic experience and especially great for us all to be together in person.

Beast Mode. 
Monster also offers Beast Mode, a mid-level manager development program for high-potential individuals to learn leadership skills, network with peers and senior executives, and tackle criti- cal-change initiatives through task forces. In 2021, 44 team members participated in this full-year pro- gram. In the final program survey, 100 percent of respondents answered “YES!” when asked whether they feel that they are in a better position to be successful in their current (and potential future) roles based upon their time in the Beast Mode program.
The program is great and would do over again anytime. Would also recommend it to anyone who wants to learn to be a great leader.

Monster University. 
For online development opportunities, Monster provides team members with access to Mon- ster University, an e-learning platform that offers 72 courses focused on job and career training, business acumen, professional development and technical capabilities. The purpose of this platform is to equip users with the tools and knowledge to execute company priorities through engaging and effective learning opportunities.
Leadership and Team Development. 
Leadership development was a major company fo- cus in 2021 with the launch of four major programs: 1. Performance Coaching – Our new program,
Monster 5-Step Best Practice Coaching Pro- cess, integrated proactive coaching via regular one-on-one sessions. Additional topics covered under this program include building bench strength, improving onboarding and improving team member recognition.
2. Interview Dos & Don’ts – A new Monster-spe- cific, nine-step interview process was developed and taught to our hiring managers to ensure: › Greater consistency enterprise-wide in inter- viewing candidates; › that the right candidates are hired every time; and › all candidates have a positive interview experi- ence.
3. Talent Management Review – A new Monster proprietary, nine-box talent matrix and talent management review process was developed, implemented and embraced organizationally to improve the way we assess talent and approach succession planning. Learning plans are devel- oped for all team members, which also allows for identification of those in need of additional training.
4. Delegating & Empowering Your Team – A new program was developed to improve delegation and empowerment of our teams. The program included over 200 participants. “ ”

SUPPLiER CODE OF CONDUCT. 
Monster is committed to conducting business re- sponsibly and under the highest ethical standards.
We hold our directors, officers and team members to these standards, guided by our Code of Busi- ness Conduct and Ethics. This commitment also extends to all our suppliers. Our Supplier Code of. 
Conduct outlines our expectations for our suppli- ers’ operations and their employees and reflects our respect for international human rights. We en- courage our suppliers to work towards implement- ing best practices and to exceed the requirements of our Supplier Code of Conduct. Adherence to the Supplier Code of Conduct is a contractual re- quirement. Currently, approximately 57 percent of our existing supplier contracts include this require- ment, and we continue to incorporate this require- ment into new supplier contracts.
Monster works closely with our suppliers to assist them in implementing our Supplier Code of Con- duct into their strategy, policies and operations.
HUMAN RiGHTS POLiCY. 
Respect for human rights is one of our core values at Monster, and it is vital to conduct our business in a manner that respects and promotes human rights. Our Human Rights Policy is guided by the international human rights principles set forth by the United Nations in their Universal Declaration of. 
Human Rights, and the International Labor Organi- zation’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and. 
Rights at Work. Our Human Rights Policy applies company-wide, regardless of location. We also expect our suppliers and distribution partners to uphold these principles and adopt similar policies within their own businesses.
The policy addresses the following issues: › Diversity and Inclusion › Forced Labor and Human Trafficking › Child Labor › Workplace Health and Safety › Workplace Security › Work Hours, Wages and Benefits › Freedom of Association of Collective Bargaining › Employee Reporting.

Employee Reporting. 
We believe in fostering a workplace in which open and honest communication among our team is val- ued and respected, and we are always working to comply with applicable labor and employment laws wherever we operate. Should we identify adverse human rights issues resulting from or caused by our business activities, we will immediately work to remediate them.
We ask team members who believe there may be a conflict between Monster’s Human Rights Pol- icy and the laws, customs and practices of their location, or who have questions about this policy, or would like to confidentially report a violation or suspected violation of the Human Rights Policy, to raise these concerns without fear of retaliation or reprisal through one of the following channels: › Contacting their direct manager or next-level manager; › contacting their Human Resources business partner; or › writing to the head of our Human Resources or.

Slavery and Human Trafficking. 
We take slavery and human trafficking very seri- ously and are vehemently opposed to slavery and human trafficking in all its forms. We recognize that modern slavery is a critical global issue, and we continue to engage with our stakeholders and sup- pliers to provide support and maintain the safety and well-being of our team members and partners.
Our Board of Directors oversees our human rights initiatives and risks. The Nominating and Corporate. 
Governance Committee of our Board of Directors oversees the company’s policies related to human rights and annually reviews the company’s efforts on these issues. Managers from Quality Assurance,

For more information about our policy on Modern Slavery, please visit: https://www.monsterbevcorp.com/ sr-transparency.php.
THE MONSTER APPROACH. 
We take a multifaceted approach to address the risk of slavery and human trafficking in our business and in our supply chain. Our efforts include: › Fostering accountability through organizational policies and governance; › incorporating our Supplier Code of Conduct into supplier contracts; › conducting due diligence on our suppliers, in- cluding verification; › establishing mechanisms for individuals to raise concerns or identify potential violations of our policies; and › taking corrective action and working with our suppliers to improve their standards when neces- sary.
SUPPLY CHAIN RISK ASSESSMENTS. 
We also recognize that certain groups are at higher risk of forced labor than others. We seek to miti- gate this risk in our supply chain by making specific inquiry into suppliers’ practices for preventing discrimination (before hiring, on the job or upon leaving) based on race and/or color, sex, religion, political opinion, national extraction, age, HIV/AIDS status, disability, nationality, sexual orientation, workers with family responsibilities and trade union membership or activities.
In partnership with a leading supply chain risk man- agement services provider, we are working with our Monster and AFF suppliers using the Slavery and Trafficking Risk Template (STRT) to identify, as- sess and address the risk of modern slavery across. 
A MESSAGE COMPANY AT A GLANCE INTRODUCTION ENVIRONMENTAL SOCIAL PRODUCT RESPONSIBILITY GOVERNANCE CREDITS AND CONTACT < >


M O N S T E R B E V E R AG E C O R P O R AT I O N / 2 0 2 1 S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O RT 50 our supply chain. This STRT is provided in multi- ple languages, and suppliers must certify to the accuracy of their responses and provide supporting evidence. These verification and certification ef- forts are not limited to our direct (Tier 1) suppliers.
Where possible, we review the suppliers of our suppliers (Tier 2), going further down the supply chain. The STRT facilitates this sub-tier approach by requiring our direct suppliers to scrutinize their own suppliers for evidence supporting proper processes for managing human trafficking and slavery risks. Suppliers are asked to certify wheth- er they require their own suppliers to accept and comply with the direct suppliers’ policies regarding forced labor and human trafficking, and whether that downstream supplier conducts its own verifica- tion activities to identify, assess, and manage risks specific to slavery and human trafficking in its own operations and supply chain. The results from these risk assessments are used to identify suppliers re- quiring further due diligence (SASB FB-NB-430a.1).
Through this data-driven risk assessment process, certain suppliers were identified as being at a high- er risk for modern slavery and human trafficking, including the following in our supply chain: sugar, coffee and tea. We placed a particular emphasis on our suppliers in these industries. In 2021, around 55 percent of the suppliers that we contacted engaged in the risk assessment process. Our risk assessments showed certain gaps in certain suppli- ers’ policies, processes and practices for managing human trafficking and slavery. We engaged these suppliers in a corrective action process and over 60 percent of the affected suppliers have completed their corrective actions at the time of writing. We continue to engage with the outstanding suppliers to implement any specific corrective actions. We are also engaging with those suppliers who have yet to complete the initial assessment (SASB FB-
NB-430a.1).
Information gained from the corrective action pro- gram has been integrated into Monster’s due dil- igence process and will be used to try to improve our Anti-Slavery and Human Trafficking program.
TRAINING. 
Providing training enables us to educate key team members and our internal auditors to recognize and combat forced labor and human trafficking. We have implemented a multifaceted training program on slavery and human trafficking, designed by a specialized third-party provider, which includes: › Employee Training – Team members whose work relates to supply chain management (including those in Procurement and the Legal Department) must attend mandatory training on slavery and human trafficking risks and implementation of. 
Monster’s policies. The training helps to equip these team members with an understanding of slavery and human trafficking issues, how their position can relate to these issues and steps to take if they have any concerns.
› Internal Auditor Training – Auditors are also given specialized training designed to help them recognize the risks and signs of slavery and hu- man trafficking in their audits.

Monster is proud to support the communities in which we operate. Our philanthropic effort is managed by our Vice President (V.P.) of Philanthro- py through our Monster Energy Cares Foundation.
Our philanthropic platforms include social responsi- bility, as well as supporting active duty, injured and retired U.S. military personnel, Monster athletes and their charities, our local communities and first responders. In 2021, we continued to grow our social responsibility as a platform of Monster Ener- gy Cares by developing three social responsibility teams globally who help oversee our engagements with charities and communities in need. We look forward to continuing to grow our social respon- sibility program and reporting on our progress in future years.
Employee Charities. 
We encourage our team members to contribute to charities of their choice, and we match their donations to qualified charitable organizations.
In 2021, in the U.S. we matched donations to 63 different charities, including Doctors Without Bor- ders, American Cancer Society and the Society of. 
St. Vincent de Paul. The EMEA team also donated to 46 charities including the British Heart Founda- tion, Harrow Food Bank and World Wildlife Fund (WWF), with 54 team member donations matched.
We also encourage our team members to explore their philanthropic passions by providing each full- time member of the Monster Family with one paid volunteer day off per year to work with their cho- sen charities. We are proud of our team members who hold positions of leadership throughout the community and donate their time, expertise and fi- nancial resources to an array of initiatives. In 2021,
U.S. team members completed more than 1,300 hours of volunteer work. In EMEA, team members completed almost 350 hours.
EMEA CHARITY WALK. 
In December 2021, team members across EMEA came together — both figuratively and literally — to participate in a walk on the same day to raise money for charity. Team members could raise money collectively for their region’s chosen charity, or for another charity of their choice, and Monster matched all donations. We were proud of the great turnout despite the ongoing impacts of COVID-19 in 2021.

We have a deep appreciation for those who serve and have served in the military. In 2021, we worked to support them in various ways.
UNITED SERVICES ORGANIZATION (USO) PARTNERSHIP. 
For 14 years, Monster Energy Cares has proudly supported the USO, which provides programs, ser- vices and live entertainment to U.S. service mem- bers and their families. To date, our company has been represented in seven USO tours, accompa- nied by Monster athletes and celebrities in support of our troops. In previous years, we were awarded the “Legacy of Hope” award for recognition of our involvement with the nation’s largest USO chap- ter. We continued our support for USO in 2021 by providing products for their activities in the.

Atlantic Ocean; a global circumnavigation flight; as well as the Explorer’s Grand Slam: summiting the highest peak on each of the seven continents, and skiing to both the North and South Poles. After two years of exploration and adventure, the epic quest will conclude with a motorbike ride across the Mojave Desert with honored U.S. Veterans, celebrities and Dawson himself. One hundred percent of the net proceeds will benefit Hope For. 
The Warriors and the Gary Sinise Foundation. We encourage readers to follow Dawson as he pushes human boundaries in the world’s harshest environ- ments and inspires us to pursue lives motivated by greater purpose and altruism.
WALKING WITH THE WOUNDED. 
Walking With The Wounded (WWTW) is a lead- ing U.K. military charity which recognizes those who serve. Whether mentally, socially or physical- ly wounded, WWTW helps to reignite Veterans’ sense of purpose, allowing them to make a positive contribution again. In 2021, Monster financially supported WWTW, and our U.K. team joined them for part of their charity walk in October.
OPERATION FINALLY HOME. 
A new charity that we supported in 2021 was Oper- ation Finally Home, which builds hope within com- munities across the U.S. by providing or improving homes for Veterans, first responders and their fam- ilies. Monster provided funds to this worthy cause to help injured veterans feel more comfortable and supported in a new place to call home.

OTHER ENGAGEMENTS. 
Through Thanks USA, an organization providing need-based college, technical and vocational school scholarships, we provided seven scholar- ships to children of U.S. military personnel.
We continue to support Warrior Built, an organiza- tion in Lake Elsinore, California that helps combat. 
Veterans’ transitions back to civilian life through vocational training, recreational therapy and men- tal health services. For over seven years, we have directly funded a facility with a full-time instructor to offer Veterans training in general auto mechan- ics and welding. The facility also provides members a gym, music room and computer room. Warrior. 
Built members also race in the Baja SCORE Inter- national offroad races each year as part of their recreational therapy.
American Humane Society’s Pups4Patriots program rescues qualified shelter dogs and trains them to offer the best possible assistance to Veterans with. 
Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Trau- matic Brain Injury (TBI). This program was support- ed by Monster through our donation to the Ameri- can Humane Society in 2021.
We also donated toward a study of PTSD carried out by University of California, Irvine and the Long. 
Beach Veterans Association.
In December 2021, Monster also donated to Team. 
Rubicon, an organization uniting the skills of Vet- erans and first responders to rapidly deploy emer- gency response and medical care to communities in need.
Athlete Charities. 
Monster is proud to sponsor some of the most talented athletes on the planet. While these ath- letes have won numerous championships in their respective sports, we are equally impressed by their commitment to helping those in need. Paul Thacker is one such Monster athlete who was paralyzed in a snowmobile accident in 2010. After surviving this accident, he started the Paul Dean Thacker Spinal. 
Cord Recovery Foundation to help fund research focused on finding cures for spinal cord injuries.
Thacker also runs a program that hosts Veterans at backcountry snowmobiling, utility task vehicle (UTV) and fly-fishing events to aid in their battlefield recovery. We donate to his foundation each year and are proud to work with someone as resilient as. 
Thacker.

In 2021, we also supported Gronk Nation Youth. 
Foundation, which is dedicated to inspiring youth to reach their maximum potential through sports, education, community and fitness. Similar support was provided to the 15 and the Mahomies Foun- dation, which is dedicated to improving the lives of children by providing resources focusing on health, wellness and youth education in communities in need.
First Responders. 
First responders are among the bravest people we know. They work around the clock to ensure our communities are safe and protected. We provide donations of our products to first responders, including police officers, firefighters, paramedics, hospital workers and SWAT team members. We also sponsor events commemorating the sacrifices first responders make on a daily basis.
In partnership with Mystery Ranch, Monster and. 
Monster Energy Cares sponsored the creation of a book about California firefighters — Moon Dust — in 2021. Moon Dust is a collection of imag- es shot over four years by photographer Rob- ert LeBlanc documenting hotshot firefighters in. 
Montana and California. One hundred percent of the proceeds from the book sales will be donated to help the Eric Marsh Foundation, the U.S. Hot- shot Association and the Mystery Ranch Backbone.

Monster’s portfolio provides a variety of options that allow our consumers to choose the best energy drink suited to their lifestyle (SASB FB-NB- 260a.2). Many of our energy drinks are offered in zero or low-calorie options, and we continue to expand our reduced calorie portfolio of products.
The following are examples of some of the prod- ucts added in 2021 to our ever-growing portfolio.
Monster Energy Ultra®: Monster Energy® Ultra. 
Gold® was added to this line of zero sugar energy drinks.
Reign Total Body Fuel® High Performance. 
Energy Drinks: We introduced two new products to this line of high-performance energy drinks with. 
BCAA’s, B-vitamins, electrolytes and CoQ10 with zero sugar (SASB FB-NB-260a.1).
In addition, we launched several of our popular products in smaller 12-ounce cans. We continue to evaluate and introduce additional products to complement our existing product lines.
New Product Highlight: True North® Pure Energy Seltzer. 
In 2021, we built upon our wide-ranging existing portfolio of alternative beverages and launched a new line of plant-based energy drinks with an immunity boost. Our True North products contain zero sugar, zero calories and zero sweetener and provide consumers an energy blend derived solely from plants, such as guayusa, ginseng, guarana, and green tea. With no genetically modified organ- isms (GMOs), artificial flavors or colors, True North is currently offered in six refreshing flavors.
True North has also partnered with One Tree Plant- ed, the world's leading reforestation charity with the aim of planting 100,000 trees across the U.S.
New Product Highlight: Monster® (stylized) Reserve. 
In 2021 we introduced new innovation to the. 
Monster Energy portfolio, derived from the original. 
Monster Energy, but with fewer calories. This new full-flavored line was designed to give you that same energy punch as the original in new fruity flavors. Monster Reserve was launched with two flavors, Watermelon and White Pineapple.
New Product Highlight: Nalu® – Tea Energizers. 
Our Nalu products are known for their fruit flavors, low calories, caffeine and added vitamins B3, E and B12. In 2021, we built upon our very successful. 
Nalu line by adding a brand-new product platform to our portfolio called Tea Energizers.
New Product Highlight: Play® Zero Sugar. 
In 2021, Play launched a new zero sugar product — Raspberry — to complement the original zero sugar variant, offering consumers the option for energy without the calories in great tasting flavors.

Uncompromising On Quality. 
Our team readily adapted to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.
In 2021, we performed supplier quality audits using mixed reality technology. We conducted 37 audits across North America, EMEA, APAC and LATAM, most of which were done virtually through Microsoft HoloLens®, a mixed reality smart glasses device.
Our pursuit toward quality remains unabated. We aim to follow the standards on drinking water set by the World Health Organization and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The vast majority of our beverages use water that has been treated with a reverse osmosis system. Additionally, contract manufacturers undergo a thorough validation process to ensure adherence with our strict quality guidelines, and we sample products throughout the manufacturing process.
96 percent of our co-packers are certified to the standards set forth by the Global Food Safety Initiative (GSFI) and our subsidiary company AFF holds numerous certifications to ensure we are meeting or exceeding industry-specific standards. AFF sites operate under the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HAACP) system, through which we evaluate and improve our food safety practices. As of 2021, AFF is certified to the following standards and accreditation programs: › Department of Halal Certification Europe › HAACP Food Safety Certified Staff › Islamic Food and Nutrition Council of America (IFANCA) › OU Kosher › Quality Assurance International (QAI) Certified Organic › Safe Quality Food (SQF) Certified › Star K Kosher Certification.

RESPONSiBLE MARKETiNG AND LABELiNG. 
As a member of the American Beverage Associ- ation, we follow its guidance for the responsible labeling and marketing of energy drinks. We do not specifically market products to children under 12 years of age, as established by the International. 
Council of Beverages Associations’ Global Policy on Marketing to Children. We also provide the caf- feine content of our products on both the product label and on our website (SASB FB-NB-270a.1).
PACKAGiNG AND RECYCLABiLiTY. 
Innovative, eye-catching and sustainable packaging is a key component of the Monster Energy bever- age consumer experience. In nearly every market, 100 percent of the primary and secondary packag- ing used to deliver our products to customers and consumers is readily recyclable.
At Monster, our products are available in a vari- ety of package types and sizes, including, but not limited to, aluminum cans, aluminum cap cans, sleek aluminum cans, aluminum cans with re-seal- able ends and, to a lesser extent, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic bottles. Our packaging choices reflect our commitment to minimizing our environmental impact. Our preferred packaging is aluminum, which can be repeatedly recycled (SASB. 
FB-NB-410a.2).

PACKAGiNG HiGHLiGHTS › In 2021, over 97 percent of Monster products were packaged in 100 percent recyclable alumi- num cans.
› In 2021, the packaging for Monster Hydro® products in the U.S. was lightweighted, which has enabled reductions in PET material by ap- proximately 3.2 grams per bottle.
› While the durability of packaging that uses recycled cardboard content is still an ongoing challenge for our industry, our multipack board packaging, which is used across a variety of products, utilizes between 7-20 percent recycled cardboard content.
› In 2021, over 80 percent of containers in our bev- erage portfolio displayed the recycle symbol.
In EMEA, we continue to investigate ways to in- crease our use of Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certified paperboard, and certain markets and part- ners utilize FSC grade paperboard exclusively. We are also evaluating our stretch wrap and shrink film to increase their levels of recycled content.
Our key packaging suppliers are leaders in the use of recycled content materials and in the promotion of recycling. In 2021, we collaborated with several supply partners to expand lightweighting efforts and significantly reduced the amount of material required to deliver our products to consumers.
Using recycled aluminum to manufacture new cans requires 95 percent less electricity than virgin primary metal. Currently, recycled content levels in. 
Monster Energy cans range from 62-73 percent. We are striving to ensure that all of our packaging is recycled and have implemented extensive recycling efforts at most of our office locations to promote recycling internally as well.
Outside of our direct operations, we encourage recycling of our products and take part in recycling programs with consumers. As examples, we have partnered with Pocono Raceway and NASCAR. 
Green for several years for the “Monster Energy. 
NASCAR Free Friday” program. At this event, fans received free access to a day of on-track events by bringing an empty can of Monster Energy for recycling. We have also run similar promotions for many American Motorcyclist Association (AMA)
Supercross events. Because of COVID-19-related restrictions for large public gatherings, these pro- grams did not occur in 2021, but we continue to explore creative ways in which we can engage with our customers on environmental topics.
To encourage our consumers to participate in the circular economy, we continued with the inclu- sion of our Monster Energy recycling logo on cans. We are also supportive of the aluminum can industry’s long-term efforts to increase recycled content levels to 85 percent and recycling rates to 90 percent. Our primary distribution partners, members of The Coca-Cola System, have commit- ted to recycle 100 percent of the packaging they deliver to the market. Over the next few years, we will continue to seek additional opportunities to collaborate with suppliers and bottling partners and pursue innovations to enhance sustainability of all packaging put into the hands of our consumers (SASB FB-NB-410a.2).

Supporting Industry Efforts to Increase Circularity of Packaging. 
Monster encourages and supports industry efforts to enhance the circularity of packaging. Several of our suppliers, including Ball Corporation (Ball), are actively incorporating circularity into their manu- facturing processes.
In 2021, Monster Energy Sustainability Task Force members participated in seminars and meetings with Ball to discuss collaboration to expand light- weighting efforts, to increase the use of recycled cans in the can manufacturing process, and to improve levels of recycling of aluminum cans. We are committed to looking for further opportunities to expand lightweighting efforts to reduce the amount of material required to deliver our prod- ucts to consumers.
In addition, Ball’s comparative life cycle assessment challenges the traditional ways sustainability has been measured in the beverage packaging indus- try. The methodology compares real recycling data for four of the most popular beverage packaging materials – aluminum, PET, glass and cartons – across three key geographies: the U.S., Europe and. 
Brazil.
We are excited to have Ball as a supplier with their robust sustainability goals and strategies, including a focus on improving product stewardship, support of targets approved by the Science-Based Target. 
Initiative, and development of a net-zero emission roadmap.

EXECUTiVE COMPENSATiON. 
Our executive compensation program is designed to reinforce ownership and overall entrepreneurial- ism, and to link rewards to measurable corporate and qualitative individual performance. The pro- gram’s primary objectives are to: › Motivate and retain executive talent; › Reward executives fairly over time for perfor- mance relative to business plan goals; and › Create sustainable stockholder value through continued profitable growth.
The executive compensation program is overseen by the Board of Directors’ Compensation Commit- tee, which is comprised entirely of independent directors.
In 2021, we continued the implementation of our revamped executive compensation program, which is more objective than our historical approach to the program. Each of our named executive officers (NEO) once again had a pre-established target bonus opportunity as part of our annual incen- tive award (AIA) program for short-term annual incentive compensation. In addition to the AIAs, the Compensation Committee approved long- term annual incentive compensation, specifically grants of performance share units (PSUs), which are the Company’s first grants of PSUs eligible to be earned based on the Company’s three-year cumu- lative adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS) from 2021 through 2023, together with time-vest- ed stock options and time-vested restricted stock units to all of our NEOs.
