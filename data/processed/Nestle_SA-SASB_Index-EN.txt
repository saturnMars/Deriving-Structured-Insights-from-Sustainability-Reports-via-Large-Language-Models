This content index accompanies Nestlé’s Creating Shared Value and Sustainability Report 2021, which has been prepared in accordance with Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards (Core) and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) Standard for the Processed Foods sector. It is designed to help stakeholders locate the relevant disclosures against each reporting standard.
In addition to these reporting standards, our disclosures reflect the results of a comprehensive materiality assessment undertaken by an independent third party. We include all material disclosures in our index, not just those required to report in accordance with the GRI Standards: Core option. To be concise, our index excludes GRI disclosures that we did not report for 2021.
For a detailed explanation of the indicators included in this index, visit the GRI website or the SASB website.
The data in this report relate to the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021, unless otherwise stated.
