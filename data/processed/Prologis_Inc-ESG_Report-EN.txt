Introduction. 
BREEAM-certified Prologis Park Venlo, Venlo, the Netherlands.


2021-22 ESG Report 4. 
Our ESG report also details progress we’ve made on inclusion & diversity. Fully 50% of our workforce is women, and people of color account for 32% of our U.S. workforce, both of which exceed industry benchmarks. To help further our progress, last year we launched a new Prologis Diverse Leaders program.
Our talented and engaged workforce make these accomplishments possible. In fact, in our most recent employee engagement survey, 94% of our employees said they are proud to work at Prologis.
I hope you take the time to read this report to learn the many ways we are helping build a cleaner and more efficient supply chain. On behalf of the Prologis team, thank you for your support and confidence. We welcome your input, ideas and questions as we continue to stay ahead of what’s next.
Sincerely,
Hamid R. Moghadam Co-Founder, CEO and Chairman 2021-22 ESG Report 4. 
Every day, our teams work to make the global supply chain more efficient and resilient.
Our 2021-22 ESG report describes the progress we’ve made on building greener, more efficient warehouses; expanding our solar program; standing up our energy and electric vehicle (EV) business; and training new skilled workers through our innovative community-based approach. We recently completed construction on our first LEED Platinum building in Brazil. We also have a cutting-edge distribution center project in the Netherlands, which was built using 30% circular or bio-based materials.
Dear Stakeholders,
Prologis is known for aiming high in all that we do. Our ambition around reducing our carbon impact is no different. That’s why we’re proud to announce the following aggressive net zero goals: • Net zero emissions by 2040 across our value chain • Net zero emissions from our operations (scopes 1 and 2) by 2030 • Enabling our customers’ decarbonization goals by deploying 1 GW of solar, supported by energy storage, by 2025. 
Every day, our teams work tirelessly to make the global supply chain more efficient and resilient. We partner with our customers and other stakeholders to develop properties and services that deliver business value and positive impact. We’re also partnering with academic and industry leaders to find new ways to innovate on sustainable warehouse building and operations.

What makes us different? 1. As of December 31, 2021.
Prologis has a significant presence in the world’s most vibrant centers of commerce. We provide comprehensive real estate services including leasing; property and asset management; development; acquisitions; dispositions; and a suite of services through our Essentials platform. Driven by the strength of our portfolio and business model, 2021 was the strongest year in our company’s history with record revenue of $4.76 billion.
As we look to the future, we expect to see continuing growth in consumption. This means our customers will continue to prioritize speed to market, inventory and flexibility. These factors create increasing demand for warehouse space and logistics services—and position us for sustained long-term success.
Real Estate Operations includes our rental and development operations. Through this business, we build to our customers’ requirements and deepen our market presence. In 2021, we achieved a record $3.6 billion of global development starts and are guiding to a record $5 billion to $5.5 billion of global development starts in 2022.
Prologis is the only public logistics REIT with a significant strategic capital business. This business generates revenues through asset management and property management services from our unconsolidated co-investment ventures. It enables many of the world’s largest institutional investors to invest with us. In 2022, we anticipate revenue from Strategic Capital will top more than $1 billion, driven, in part, by management and incentive fees.
We create value beyond our real estate. In 2021, we continued to scale our Prologis Essentials platform, which offers services and solutions that span five core categories designed to meet the needs of today’s logistics customer: operations, energy, workforce, transportation and digital. This platform has a strong sustainability component to its suite of services, which supports our customers’ progress toward their sustainability goals. Additional business functions include Prologis Ventures and Prologis Labs, each of which is described later in this report.

Mission and values Each day, we work to make the global supply chain more resilient through excellence in logistics. This gives meaning and purpose to what we do.
Our mission is to be the leading logistics real estate company as measured by customer service, employee engagement, financial performance and balance sheet strength. Our core values guide how we work with our colleagues, customers and communities:
I M P A C T. 
Integrity Mentorship Passion Accountability Courage Teamwork. 
Customer Centricity. 
Change through Innovation and Operational Excellence. 
Culture and Talent. 
Inclusion & diversity (I&D) are vital aspects of how we work. We describe our approach in the Inspired People section of this report.
Throughout our history, we have maintained a mindset of continuous change. This is embodied in our “3Cs” approach:
In his welcome video to new employees, our Co-Founder, CEO and Chairman Hamid R. Moghadam notes: “Unlike other real estate companies that talk about transactions and the next opportunity, we talk about our customers and how we can best serve them.” He encourages employees to “simplify and sprint” and “fail fast.” “Be curious and intellectually rigorous in your work. We want people to make independent judgements and be resourceful.”
Breaking new ground with inaugural thought leadership event. 
In October 2021, approximately 4,000 people participated in Prologis’ inaugural Groundbreakers thought leadership event. The series is intended to serve as a forum for discussion of key issues facing the industry.
The keynote featured Prologis Co-Founder, CEO and Chairman Hamid R. Moghadam, UPS CEO Carol Tomé and Fortune magazine senior special correspondent Susie Gharib discussing rapid innovation and investment during a time of significant change. Additional sessions covered smart transportation; the future of energy; and workforce challenges and solutions. The event concluded with a talk from bestselling author Michael Lewis and the introduction of GROUNDBREAKERS, Prologis’ biannual e-magazine.
Additional information, including recordings of key sessions, can be found online at groundbreakers.prologis.com. A second event is scheduled for October 2022.

2021-22 ESG Report 14. 
Creating value through ESG Whether they are multinational corporations or small businesses, our customers are interested in driving value through ESG performance. When we minimize the impact of construction, maximize building operating efficiency and provide value-added services such as electric vehicle (EV) charging and workforce development, we can boost our customers’ bottom lines and help them achieve their ESG goals. When we engage proactively with the communities we serve, incorporate their ideas and minimize their concerns, we build trust and create the conditions where both the business and community can flourish.
Our global ESG team drives strategic alignment of ESG-related activities across the business. Senior leaders are responsible for integrating key ESG principles into the work of their teams. And ESG performance impacts annual bonuses (Please see page 43 of our latest Proxy Statement for more). In the last year, Prologis has invested in the ESG talent and tools needed to advance ESG. These include a new chief energy and sustainability officer, VP of global ESG, and regional and functional leaders focused on such aspects as ESG data/information technology management, EV charging, and Inclusion & Diversity.
Prologis Alcala Distribution Center, Madrid, Spain.
Innovation in sustainable financing. 
To help fund projects that enhance sustainability and drive overall environmental benefit at our facilities, Prologis and our co-investment ventures in Europe, Japan, Mexico and the U.S. have issued 16 green bonds and three green private placements of debt over the past four years. These bonds and private placements leverage the strength of our sustainable building program to provide ESG financing products that attract environmentally conscious investors from around the world. The Prologis Green Bond Framework guides how we evaluate and select projects and how we use and manage green bond proceeds.
Our sustainable financing efforts also include several revolving lines of credit across our owned and manage portfolio. These include our global line of credit (GLOC) and additional sustainability linked lines of credit that support the operations of the FIBRA, PELF and USLF. Our GLOC is based on the growth in the percentage of our owned and managed portfolio that is sustainability certified. We expect that this growth will be primarily derived from our development pipeline. In 2021, the baseline year, 19.36% of our portfolio was sustainably certified.

Innovation at Inagawa In Hyogo, Japan, our Inagawa 2 facility recently adopted the Hacobu MOVO Berth truck reception system to boost the efficiency of customer operations.
The tablet-based system allows our customers to easily manage truck entry and exit from a single driver reception area. This includes identifying the appropriate dock as well as coordinating warehousing and delivery work. The system displays arrivals, work status, berth operation status and other details on screen in real time.
The system also collects and displays data on vehicle numbers, wait times and work hours, allowing our customers to make additional operational improvements. The shorter wait times also mean satisfied drivers, less vehicle idling and reduced emissions.
Smart Berth software, Prologis Inagawa, Hyogo, Japan.
Employee innovation in action The Prologis team in Japan identified a very specific problem: steel guards intended to protect logistics facility assets were difficult to install, often dented, and expensive to repair and maintain. In partnership with Fukuvi Chemical Industry Co., Ltd., the team developed a new polyvinyl chloride (PVC) forklift guard. Lighter, easier to handle and 40% less expensive than typical steel guards, the PVC guards can be installed easily and are designed to absorb impacts and save maintenance costs. They can last for decades and be recycled into pallets at the end of their usable life.
The new guards have already been installed in Prologis Park Chiba 2 and Prologis Urban Tokyo Adachi 1 and will be available to customers through Prologis Essentials at all new developments going forward. Prologis has applied for a Japanese patent and will receive licensing fees with each sale.

With e-commerce setting records during the 2020 holiday season and package deliveries forecast to grow by 80%1 over the next decade, a new study by the MIT Real Estate Innovation Lab reveals the tangible environmental benefits of online shopping.
Driven by the stay-at-home economy, online retailing surged and remained at peak levels throughout 2020. Early estimates suggest U.S. online sales grew by upwards of 50%2 (y/y) in 2020’s expanded holiday shopping season, with similar trajectories in other major e-commerce markets including China, Europe, Japan and elsewhere. Using average emissions results from the MIT study, the share shift to e-commerce resulted in approximately 2.4% fewer emissions per package.

The Broad View 1. Customer activity is setting records, with Prologis’ IBI™ activity index rising from 59 in Q1 to 71 in Q2. These results indicate sustained robust activity as supply chains race to restock amid rapid consumer purchasing, in turn creating strong future demand. Logistics demand reached a record quarterly high of 110 million square feet (MSF) in the second quarter, bringing absorption for the first half of the year to an unprecedented 194 MSF, more than double from the same period last year.1 Demand was broad-based across a range of customers, with urgency to secure space a major factor.
2. Space utilization, which remained in the 84-85% range in the second quarter, reveals the challenges supply chains face keeping items in stock during a period of record retail sales growth.
3. Record-level rent growth is also underway, as surging demand runs up against high barriers to new supply. Vacancies fell to 4.1% in the second quarter and rents rose by 4%, each a record.
4. Prologis Research has revised our 2021 forecast upward for both demand and supply, to 360 MSF and 325 MSF respectively. Supply continues to rise but cannot keep pace with demand. Robust demand, increasing replacement costs and limited availabilities should push rent growth above 10% in 2021.

Key messages 1. Higher inventory-to-sales ratios are key to the future supply chain. Disruptions in the flow of goods will persist beyond the pandemic, driven by structural forces in climate, geopolitics and labor.
2. Higher inventories will require 800 million square feet (MSF) of logistics real estate or more to fix the shortage and build in resilience. Logistics real estate leasing is not yet reflecting resilience-driven demand because companies need to first focus on immediate inventory challenges.
3. Gateway locations are poised to benefit as the first step on the consumption end of supply chains. Because these locations generally have high barriers to new logistics development, demand is expected to outstrip supply.
Inventory patterns need to change. Even though the justin-time model allowed for a structural decline in inventory-tosales ratios, it also relied on the smooth flow of goods [exhibit 1]. The decline steadied in the 2010s as e-commerce grew as a share of the retail business; online channels that offer more product variety by default require more inventory.
Disruptions are interrupting this flow, as the interconnected structural shifts that drive climate [exhibit 2], geopolitical [exhibit 3] and labor risks [exhibit 4] increase. Today’s disruptions offer a preview: the pandemic; weather (the impact of the deep freeze in Texas on chemical plants, for example); trade (Brexit uncertainties); and labor shortages (drayage constraints and. 
Supply chains will shift permanently toward resilience. This will create powerful demand tailwinds in logistics real estate and could prolong or worsen the shortage of space and labor. Tomorrow’s supply chain will be defined by those who act quickly and decisively.

How we work. 
Prologis’ culture, systems and processes promote integrity, accountability and sound decision-making across the company. We implement innovative ESG practices to elevate our leadership and create a more resilient company.
Board oversight The Prologis board of directors serves as a fiduciary for shareholders; sets company strategy; and provides independent and experienced oversight. The board has four standing committees: • Audit Committee • Board Governance and Nomination Committee • Talent and Compensation Committee • Executive Committee. 
As of December 31, 2021, 10 of the 11 members of our board (91%) qualified as independent, according to the principles and standards established by the New York Stock Exchange. We describe the rights and responsibilities of our independent lead director in our latest Proxy Statement.
By charter, the Board Governance and Nomination Committee oversees ESG performance and updates the full board on ESG matters. This includes performance against ESG goals and updates to our climate risk assessment processes.
The Prologis board believes that diversity promotes robust discussion and the consideration of a range of viewpoints. In 2021, the board updated its governance guidelines to state that:
In any formal search for new directors, the Board Governance and Nomination Committee will consider, and will instruct any third-party search firm to include, candidates from diverse backgrounds, including in its initial list both gender and racial/ ethnic diversity.
Our Talent and Compensation Committee receives updates on our human capital performance and approach, including Inclusion & Diversity performance. For more information on our governance practices, see our latest Proxy Statement.
BOARD DIVERSITY BOARD TENURE1 0-5 Years 6-11 Years 12+ Years. 
Five years of ESG-based compensation incentives. 
Prologis began linking a portion of executive and employee compensation to ESG performance in 2017 through the company’s annual bonus plan. In 2022, ESG metrics will be a stand-alone category and represent 10% of the bonus scorecard—a percentage similar to that of other core business functions. The category will include environmental metrics (such as megawatts of solar and LED lighting installed), social metrics (such as measurement of culture, talent, inclusion scores and the number of new participants in our Community Workforce Initiative) and governance metrics (such as thirdparty assessment of our corporate governance ratings performance). This is a change from prior years when ESG performance was not its own distinct category. Additional details on executive compensation may be found in our most recent Proxy Statement.
1. The entire board was rebuilt in 2011 at the time of the merger (the “Merger”) between AMB Property Corporation and ProLogis and the tenure of the rebuilt board started at that time. However, we include Mr. Moghadam, Ms. Kennard, Mr. Webb and Mr. Skelton in the 12+ year category as they were directors of the legal aquirer prior to the merger.

Risk management Effective risk management can help us achieve strong and predictable business outcomes to better serve our employees, customers, partners and shareholders.
We use a global risk management framework to manage risks facing our company and industry. Information on these risks can be found in the “Risk Factors” section of our 10-K. Risks are owned by the respective business teams, with engagement and oversight from our risk management, legal, compliance and internal audit teams.
A tool for evaluating climate risk. 
Prologis has developed a tool for evaluating risks and opportunities related to climate change and natural hazards.
The tool uses data from a leading global reinsurer, including a range of natural hazard factors and three GHG emissions trajectories. A proprietary dashboard, developed by our in-house geospatial analytics team, provides enhanced visual insights.
Although our portfolio has proven resilient thus far, the data and dashboard allow us to further assess the effect of more extreme temperatures and more frequent and intense natural disasters.
Through our use of this tool, we can be more strategic in terms of how we improve our assets to make them more resilient.
In the coming years, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may require material assessment of the positive and negative impacts of climate change and natural hazards. Our approach to climate risk has helped us prepare for this possibility.
More information on our approach to climate risk management can be found in our TCFD disclosure.
Our risk assessment processes include scenario testing, audit controls, probabilistic modeling and input from third-party experts. Risk assessment findings are regularly reported through quarterly updates to the executive committee, audit committee and board of directors.
Examples of our risk management framework in action include: • Investment Committee: All material capital deployment (development, acquisitions and dispositions) is subject to review by our Investment Committee (IC), which evaluates investment considerations as well as environmental matters (including whether a sustainable building certification is included); natural hazard exposures; and legal and regulatory considerations. Our CEO and chairman, COO, CFO, CIO, CCO and several other senior leaders serve on this committee.
• Cybersecurity: We use robust and constantly changing measures to defend against emerging cyber risk scenarios. This includes mandatory annual cybersecurity training for all employees. In 2021, we tested these measures in a cross-functional cyberattack scenario administered by a third-party expert.
PRIMARY RISK CATEGORIES.

No material information security or privacy incidents occurred in 2021.
• Climate Risk: Portfolio resilience is critical to our customers, investors and other stakeholders. Through a partnership with a global third-party reinsurer, we obtain asset-specific hazard information across 12 factors and three climate pathway scenarios. This data helps us better understand our exposure and enhance our risk-mitigation efforts. Additional detail on our approach to climate risk is in Sustainable Logistics and in our TCFD disclosure.
Supply chain responsibility As the provider of modern, efficient logistics facilities, we play a role in our customers’ supply chains and can help them achieve their own sustainability goals. Through our global procurement processes, we strive to deliver the overall best value to our customers by enabling our teams to deliver high-quality products and services while reducing total costs and risks. For example, purchasing concrete and steel (the two largest material components of facilities) from local suppliers allows us to invest in the communities where we operate; spur local employment; and reduce shipping and transportation costs and their associated environmental impacts.
Our Supplier Code of Conduct describes our expectations for business, employment, environmental, social and ethical practices, including the use and conduct of subcontractors. The code includes measures to: • Prohibit the use of involuntary and child labor in support of Prologis’ commitment to human rights • Provide a work environment free of discrimination and harassment based on gender, race, color, national origin, age, religion, marital status, disability, sexual orientation or veteran status • Promote a safe and healthy work environment in accordance with all applicable regulations • Promote environmental benefits through reduced energy and water consumption and implementation of waste-minimization programs. 
An independent third-party conducts prequalification supply chain risk management evaluations to ensure that potential suppliers meet our standards. In 2022, we will be completing a review of our supply chain responsibility and risk assessment to identify opportunities to engage with our suppliers and build capacity.
Human rights We are committed to operating our business in an ethical manner that protects human rights. Our Global Human Rights Policy outlines our commitment to: • Fair hiring, compensation and promotion. • Preventing the use of child and indentured or forced labor, including in our supply chain.
• Maintaining a safe and healthy work environment. • Following all applicable laws and regulations that govern working hours, guarantee fair and equal compensation, and protect the right to collective bargaining and freedom of association.
Our Ethics and Compliance and ESG departments are responsible for this policy and for tracking emerging issues and regulations. In 2021, no significant human rights controversies were identified by major third-party ESG raters: Dow Jones Sustainability Indices, MSCI and Sustainalytics.
Purchasing concrete and steel from local suppliers allows us to invest in the communities where we operate.

2021-22 ESG Report 24. 
The opportunity to decarbonize. 
Buildings and logistics each have a significant impact on global greenhouse gas emissions. According to the U.S. Energy Information Agency: 47% of annual global CO2 emissions come from building operations; building materials and construction; and other construction industry sources. 28% of annual global CO2 emissions come from the transportation sector.
By helping to reduce or eliminate these emissions, Prologis provides its customers with an important value-added service: We help them operate more efficiently, reduce their costs and achieve their own decarbonization and climate-related goals.
Climate change and energy. 
As the global leader in logistics real estate, we must act with urgency to help mitigate climate change.
In 2018, we became the first logistics REIT with an approved science based target. In 2022, we have increased our ambition and updated this target: Our new goal is to reach net zero emissions across our value chain by 2040.
Our approach is threefold: We measure our emissions; reduce emissions across our value chain; and invest in carbon-reduction technologies.
We have been carbon neutral for scope 1 (direct emissions) and scope 2 (emissions from purchased energy) since 2019. We accomplished this by improving energy efficiency and through our purchase of high-quality carbon offsets and renewable energy certificates (RECs). See Our approach to carbon offsets for more detail.
Scope 3 emissions (emissions not directly associated with our operations) represent 99.9% of our total emissions footprint—and our best opportunity to make an impact. We can reduce our scope impacts by reducing building and tenant energy consumption; expanding our generation and use of renewable energy —and providing this resource to our customers; making sustainable design choices for new building construction; and supporting the transition to low/nocarbon vehicles.
We anticipate that energy consumption across our industry will continue to rise in line with increased demand for building electrification, automation of warehouse operations and fleet decarbonization.
We can optimize energy use and minimize greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by:
Operating buildings more efficiently (electrification, LED lighting, cool roofs)
Generating and delivering renewable energy to our customers to support their operations, including their use of EVs. 
Pursuing sustainable building certifications for all new developments and redevelopments. This includes constructing more efficient buildings and using loweremissions materials and methods. 
Our new goal is to reach net zero emissions across our value chain (which includes scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions) by 2040.
As part of our increased focus on data, we are reviewing our GHG emissions methodology and data systems to create better visibility into reduction opportunities as our business both grows and decarbonizes. This will also help our customers understand the actions they can take to meet their climate goals.
Each of these activities reduces our impact as well as that of our customers.

In 2021, approximately 60 customers— including Home Depot, Daimler Trucks, Cummins, FLEX and The JM Smucker Company participated in this program. We also participate in community solar and utility programs to provide clean energy to the local community and utility grid. As we expand our generating capacity, we plan to provide battery storage and energy resilience as a service to onsite customers and utilities, which allows storage of excess daytime energy for use after the sun has set.
LED lighting LED lighting uses 60 to 80% less energy than standard warehouse lighting. Through our Prologis Essentials LED solution, customers can upgrade to LED lighting with no upfront capital costs. They pay just 1 cent per square foot per month, reduce their energy use and enjoy the benefits of LEDs, which include improved safety, productivity and employee satisfaction.
At year-end 2021, we had installed LED lighting across 57% of the warehouse and office space in our portfolio. By 2025, we intend to reach 100%.
Mobility and EV charging A growing number of Prologis customers are adopting EVs to reduce their emissions. When they charge their fleets at logistics facilities, they minimize deviations from routes and leverage dwell time. Our portfolio includes approximately 200 EV charging stations. In 2022, we plan to expand EV charging as a service to customers and expect to manage approximately 10 MWs of EV charging capacity.
Consistent with our net zero goal, we will continue to expand our portfolio of decarbonization solutions to help our customers achieve their targets in cost-effective ways.

Green building design and construction. 
To minimize our impact and meet customer and community needs, we include many sustainable elements in the construction of our buildings.
Building certifications Since 2008, Prologis has been building to LEED or equivalent sustainable building standards when feasible. Our portfolio includes more than 550 buildings with sustainable certifications from LEED, BREEAM, WELL, CASBEE, DGNB, HQE and other best-in-class certifiers. As of June 2021, every development and redevelopment project approved by our Investment Committee will achieve a sustainable certification.
In 2021, our LEED Volume Program was re-approved by the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) at the higher LEED v4 standard, a first for the U.S. logistics real estate sector. This program leverages our scale to procure certifications in a more cost- and time-efficient manner. It also guides our work to improve sustainable site development, water savings, energy efficiency, materials selection and indoor environmental quality. Since 2014, our participation in this program has saved us approximately $36 million.
Construction waste and circularity According to the International Energy Agency, the buildings and buildings construction sectors combined are responsible for almost 33% of total global final energy consumption and nearly 15% of direct CO2 emissions.
By 2025, Prologis aims to achieve carbon neutral construction in every building we build or redevelop. We plan to accomplish this by minimizing construction waste and using smart building design, new construction technologies and recycled materials. As an example, our 26,000 square meter Prologis Park Waalwijk DC3 distribution center in the Netherlands was built using approximately 30% overall circular, bio-based or cradleto-cradle (C2C) materials, with all materials catalogued in a digital materials passport to facilitate future reuse. For the emissions we cannot eliminate using these methods, we will purchase high-quality certified carbon offsets.
Construction represents our largest waste impact—and a significant opportunity to expand our use of circular design. Every Prologis construction project has a waste. 
CONSTRUCTION WASTE MANAGEMENT1 mt management plan. To help achieve a sustainability certification, Prologis construction projects incorporate the use of recycled material; source building materials locally; and collect and publish contractor-reported waste data where feasible.
As an additional pathway to reducing construction waste, Prologis has also begun incorporating circular design principles into our new construction. In the Netherlands, we have used a “circular toolbox,” including circular concepts, practices and methods to guide warehouse construction. We also use a digital material passport in some markets to catalog the materials and components used in a new building to make it easier to reuse them at the building’s end of life.
Across the business, we are working to improve our waste practices, including the quality of our waste data.

Cool roofs Where appropriate, depending on a building’s location, we install white or reflective surfaces on roofs to reduce a building’s energy consumption. Benefits include an upto-15% reduction in the amount of energy needed for air conditioning; reduced roof maintenance costs from ultraviolet and infra-red damage; and a reduction in the urban heat island effect. At year-end 2021, 47% of our rooftop space was covered with a cool or reflective coating.
Responsible water use Logistics facilities typically operate with a very low impact on water availability and quality. We design retention and detention systems to ensure a site’s water discharge rate does not exceed its pre-development rate. We install low-flow toilets and motion-activated faucets to reduce consumption. And we use native plants which require limited additional watering. To monitor a building’s water system remotely, Prologis Labs has developed smart pump kits that can collect and transmit data on water temperature, pump activity (vibration) and leaks.

Prologis’ Park Moissy II DC1 is a 1 million square foot logistics facility in Paris. Built with no gas connection, the building relies on design efficiencies, rooftop solar, purchased renewable energy and borehole geothermal energy storage for heating, cooling and power. It features electric and natural gas vehicle infrastructure, a rain catchment system for irrigation, 12 acres of PARKlifeTM space and placement of beehives on site. (The honey is shared with the tenant.) These innovations avoid 115,000 mtCO2e of greenhouse gas emission and reduce operating expenses by an estimated $215,000 each year, depending on energy prices.

Mineralizing CO2 for stronger concrete. 
When tornados ripped through Nashville, Tennessee, in 2020, three Prologis warehouses were damaged and needed to be replaced. In planning the new construction, Prologis turned to CarbonCure Technologies to lower the embodied carbon of concrete, a significant source of CO2 emissions.
CarbonCure works by injecting captured CO₂ into fresh concrete where it immediately mineralizes into calcium carbonate, strengthening the material while permanently locking away this CO₂. Even after the concrete is eventually broken up, the mineralized CO₂ will never leak or return to the atmosphere. The final product is the same high-quality concrete with a lower carbon footprint.
The use of CarbonCure in the three buildings’ floors, tilt walls and exterior paving saved almost 250 metric tons of CO2—roughly the amount absorbed by 300 acres of trees in one year. We are looking for opportunities to use this innovative material in other projects.
Biodiversity Prologis’ business strategy is to build, own and operate logistics facilities close to urban centers. As such, building construction and operation typically has a minimal impact on biodiversity. All our developments are subject to local environmental permitting processes, often including evaluation of sensitive habitats and protected species. Where feasible, we incorporate native. 
Our goal is to mitigate the embodied carbon of every project in Europe.
plants in landscaping to support native wildlife. Some developments promote environmental health and biodiversity by removing historic contaminants from the soil and water.
Through a partnership with Cool Earth, we protect rainforest in Papua New Guinea or Peru equal to 31 times the footprint of each European facility that we build. These *Does not include our development management activities in China.
rainforests are home to over 6 million species of animals and plants and serve as powerful carbon sinks. As an example, our Cologne Niehl DC2 building in Germany mitigated building land use impact by protecting 245 acres in Papua New Guinea, an area equivalent to 31 times the gross internal area of the building.
In addition to its positive impact on biodiversity, this partnership also helps us achieve our goal to mitigate the embodied carbon for every project in Europe. In 2021, we achieved this goal, making contributions to mitigate the carbon associated with the construction that took place at all 32 of our projects in Europe. Since 2008, we’ve mitigated 6.1 million metric tons of carbon through this partnership.
Our approach to carbon offsets At Prologis, as part of our “measure-reduce-invest” approach to carbon management, we use carbon offsets only when necessary. We purchase high-quality thirdparty verified1 offsets based on: • Additionality (mitigation or removal would not otherwise have occurred).
• Co-location (in same geographic region as our operations).
• ESG co-benefits (local social and environmental benefit beyond emissions reduction).
In 2021, we purchased offsets for approximately 20% (~240,000 metric tons of CO2e) of our 2021 constructionrelated GHG emissions. These offsets included rainforest conservation in Brazil, Canada and Mexico and conservation, habitat management and building insulation alternatives in the U.S.
We are exploring opportunities to leverage our onsite generation of excess solar energy to create additive REC and carbon offset opportunities for our customers.

Inclusion & diversity. 
How we operate • We set clear expectations on inclusive hiring for our colleagues and staffing agencies. This includes a goal that each candidate pool be 50% diverse.
• We determine a portion of our annual bonus based on the percentage of diverse hires in real estate roles. • We conduct an annual pay equity analysis that covers gender and people of color and includes base salary, bonus and long-term incentives. The analysis is reviewed by our executive committee and board of directors. In the first quarter of 2022, our annual global gender pay equity analysis found women are overall paid within +/- 3% of their male peers in the same job and same labor market. Our analysis also found people of color in the U.S. are overall paid within +/- 3% of their white peers in the same job and same labor market. When we find differences in compensation not explained by relevant job factors, we adjust compensation accordingly.
How we learn • We include questions related to inclusion and diversity in our annual employee engagement survey. Survey respondents are asked how much they agree with statements such as, “Diverse perspectives are valued and encouraged in my team” and “I am comfortable voicing my ideas and opinions, even if they are different from others.” • In 2021, we added new educational resources, programs and toolkits to support employee training on inclusion and diversity. These include a new I&D intranet site, unconscious bias awareness training and celebration of special days and months (e.g. Black History, Women’s History, Pride) throughout the year.
• In 2022, we will launch our global I&D steering committee to support and guide our efforts. The chairs of our five newly created employee resource groups (African Americans, Asian Americans, Latinx, LGBTQIA+ and women) will participate in this steering committee along with other senior leaders.
How we engage beyond our walls • We partner with industry organizations—like ULI, NAIOP, NAREIT and REAP —to broaden our candidate pools through recruiting and mentoring efforts. Through our partnership with NAIOP, we help women and members of underrepresented groups advance their careers in commercial real estate.
• To encourage careers in real estate, we sponsor scholarships for individuals from underrepresented groups and invest in educational development and job training programs in the communities where we operate. This includes the work of our Community Workforce Initiative, described in Resilient Communities.
• We provide philanthropic support to organizations working to advance equity and inclusion. In 2020, the Prologis. 
Foundation designated $1 million to support organizations fighting for racial justice.
Different perspectives are strengths. The biggest danger for companies— particularly successful companies—is when they engage in group think. And group think comes from people who all have the same background, who’ve all gone to the same schools. After all, our customers are pretty diverse, our communities are pretty diverse, why shouldn’t our people be diverse? – Hamid R. Moghadam, Co-Founder, CEO and Chairman. 
Prologis’ Inclusion & Diversity (I&D) vision is to create a company where everyone is respected, included and treated fairly. We recognize the business value of inclusion and diversity: When we incorporate a wide range of perspectives, better business and customer outcomes are possible. As part of our commitment, we are a signatory to CEO Act!on for Diversity & Inclusion.

Stakeholder engagement. 
Our stakeholders include employees, contractors, suppliers, customers, community members and leaders, elected officials and investors.
To keep our employees updated on important company developments and industry trends, we leverage multiple internal communication channels. Webinars let employees opt in to learn about a particular topic that interests them. To share best practices, we publish employee success stories on our intranet. At town hall meetings, employees have the opportunity to ask our senior leaders tough questions. All of these methods create a consistent culture that connects Prologis employees around the world. Additional information on our employees can be found in Inspired People.
We engage, on a case-by-case basis, with key stakeholders in local communities during project development. Engagement occurs through social media and dedicated websites; face-to-face meetings; and presentations, exhibitions and workshops. Community feedback helps us design and build a development that adds value to our customers and the community where they operate.
Prologis’ people are the foundation of our commitment to our customers. Our maintenance techs, customerfocused managers and leaders are highly motivated to develop the customer relationship. They adapt to customer needs and work to exceed expectations though onsite visits, e-mails, phone calls and even an online app.
The role of government affairs at Prologis is to advance the company’s interests through responsible and constructive engagement with public policy makers, elected officials and community leaders. We educate key decisionmakers at all levels of government about our company and the critical role we play in global commerce. This includes our approach to sustainable development, our renewable energy investments and our work to help our customers operate in a cleaner more efficient way. If a public policy action has the potential to impact our business, our industry or our customers, we conduct a full review and analysis; develop a thoughtful, data-driven response; and share it with relevant decisionmakers. Prologis’ unique perspective on topics like workforce, the supply chain, renewable energy and transportation is both vital and valued.

Community Workforce Initiative Recruitment and retention of logistics talent is a key challenge for many of our customers. Recognizing this, we launched our Community Workforce Initiative (CWI) in 2018. CWI is a talent development program that can advance the skills and capabilities of logistics workers, while also building a pipeline to careers with our customers.
Feedback from stakeholders and lessons learned during early pilot programs have informed our strategy and ambition. Today, our goal is long-term systems change built on a foundation of training 25,000 people by 2025. Over the past three years, and in spite of pandemic-related challenges, we have grown the program to reach 17 markets through partnerships with nearly 20 community organizations in three countries. As of year-end 2021, we have trained more than 13,000 people and placed nearly 1,500 people in logistics jobs.

In 2021, in response to a range of crises around the world, we donated 1.2 million square feet of space worth $5.4 million in in-kind rent to 30 charities.
CWI includes courses in areas such as equipment training; inventory and warehouse management; and environmental impact. The Association of Supply Chain management, the largest supply chain association in the world, has certified CWI with the first-of-its-kind logistics training certificate. We believe this certificate will serve as the global standard in logistics training and education.
Industry-developed training programs like Prologis CWI offer concrete opportunities to learn skills that are aligned with immediate job openings. We’ve seen the positive impact this program can have on people’s lives. We’re proud to collaborate with Prologis to help people in the Long Beach area and beyond acquire the skills necessary for immediate labor market attachment and advancement.

We #standwithukraine. 
In early 2022, in response to the invasion of Ukraine, the Prologis Foundation began double matching every employee donation to the following organizations: • International Red Cross’ Ukrainian relief campaign.
• Poland – Polska Akcja Humanitarna (Polish Humanitarian Action).
• Czech Republic – Člověk v tísni /
People in Need CR.
• Slovakia - Člověk v ohrození/People in Need SK. • Hungary - UNICEF Hungary.
As of May 15, 2022, employee donations totaled approximately $250,000. Combined with a double match from the Prologis Foundation, the company’s total contribution was more than $750,000. Many European employees also gave their time, donated needed supplies and even opened up their homes to refugees.
Together, with my husband, we made the decision to host a Ukrainian refugee family with two small children. As they needed nearly everything to start their life in Warsaw, we also organized a collection of goods with Prologis colleagues, our friends, neighbors and parents from our kids’ school. After only three days, the amount of goods collected enabled us to support an additional family. It’s now about shifting from providing short-term help into a long-term solution.

Supporting social wellness and wellbeing helps build our relationship with the communities we serve. As a longterm owner, we establish a presence in the community, build relationships with key stakeholders and demonstrate our commitment. Our goal is to be the logistics facility provider of choice, not only for our customers but for the communities where our customers do business.
Parklife Moissy, Moissy, France.
As a long-term owner, we build relationships with key stakeholders.
Our PARKlife™ program is one example of this approach. Through PARKlife, we create a range of services and amenities to support our customers, their employees and the community at large. These include green spaces and fitness trails, art installations, green transportation programs, amenity maintenance and security. Examples include: • In November 2021, Barcelona’s Prologis Park Sant Boi hosted its first farmer’s market, inviting vendors from the nearby Mercado de Cooperativa Agrària Santboiana to sell fresh produce onsite. Designed to encourage healthy eating, sustainable consumption and support for the local community, the greenmarket event was well received and is planned to continue on a monthly basis.
• As part of a makeover of Prologis Park Lodi near Milan, Italy, we asked eight leading. 
Italian street artists to create large-scale works across 44,000 square meters of park facade. The result is a monumental open-air urban art gallery that elevates the dayto-day work experience and adds visual richness to the surrounding neighborhood.

Particularly in the wake of a crisis, our customers must maintain the flow of goods and services to the customers and communities they serve.
In 2021, across our 4,700-facility portfolio, there were more than 50 times when natural hazard events resulted in insurance claims. These included unprecedented floods in China, Germany and Belgium; the Texas Freeze; and other severe events throughout the United States. Our planning and risk mitigation measures protected our customers’ business continuity: Only two of these events led to business-continuity-insured damage in excess of $500,000.
In 2021 and the first part of 2022, we hosted Disaster Recovery Plan tabletop scenarios for Europe where we worked through flooding, snowstorm and windstorm scenarios. We also hosted a training with the U.S. West Region that focused on earthquake preparedness and included working through hypothetical scenarios. In Inagawa, Japan, we agreed that our facility would serve as the local disaster response hub if needed. We are also directly involved in supporting disaster response through our Space for Good program, described earlier in this section.
Mitigating flood risk in Italy. 
In 2019, Prologis acquired 408 acres of uncultivated land, former quarries and disused industrial properties in Castelnuovo di Porto, Italy, to serve as the site for a two-hundredthousand-square-meter logistics facility.
As part of the permitting phase, Prologis agreed to mitigate flood risk from the nearby Tiber River, working in partnership with experts from the University of Rome and other institutional organizations. The results of these mitigation efforts will positively impact neighboring municipalities and the city of Rome, some 10 miles to the south.
We describe our approach to climate risk in more detail in the Sustainable Logistics section of this report.
Community safety is another opportunity for us to go above and beyond what our stakeholders might expect of a typical logistics real estate company.
Prologis leases require tenants to comply with all applicable laws and regulations in their operations and occupancy of the leased premises. We conduct financial due diligence on a tenant before entering into a lease agreement, and we work closely with our tenants throughout their leases. Once leased, our tenants have exclusive possession and control of the premises under the terms of the lease as well as tenant-landlord law. When we become aware of conditions that might impact community safety, we notify relevant authorities and take corrective action, including seeking to evict the tenant if appropriate.
When a community safety incident occurs at or near a Prologis property, we work with our tenants to mitigate and minimize the community impact as part of our commitment to being a good neighbor.
In addition to workplace safety, we also develop disaster preparedness and recovery plans to maintain business continuity for our customers and their employees.

Community involvement. 
The community impact we create goes beyond the value of our operations to include community giving and volunteering. We focus these efforts in three areas: education, the environment and community support. On our annual IMPACT Day, we close our offices and encourage every employee to participate in a volunteer event in the region where they work.
In 2021, Prologis employees delivered more than 10,700 hours to organizations serving local communities, including the National System for Integral Family Development in the U.S.; Honzon Group in Beijing, China; and HEMA in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Prologis employees Anita Weggemans and Fumie Yoshihara were the recipients of the 2021 Walter C.
A sustainable “Hub” for community-based training. 
In September 2021, Prologis celebrated the grand opening of the Hub at DIRFT III. The Hub is a nearly 10,000 square foot training and amenities building in Northampton, UK. The facility was built to UK Green Building Council standards for net zero construction and has achieved an EPC A+ rating for operations.
In addition to serving as an amenities center for the Prologis park and local community, The Hub hosts the Prologis Warehousing and Logistics Training Programme (PWLTP), an extension of the company’s U.S.-focused Community Workforce Initiative. PWLTP uses a combination of in-person and online. 
Rakowich Award, Prologis’ highest honor for communitybased service. Anita worked with her daughter during the Dock Doors of Giving campaign and Fumie organized several activities in the office, such as making face shields for caretakers at nursing homes.
In 2021, Prologis and the Prologis Foundation made $4.7 million in contributions to organizations around the world. In the U.S., through our “Dollars for Doers” program, the Foundation matches employee donations and provides monetary support to organizations where employees volunteer.
In 2022, we continue our work to evolve our social impact and corporate giving strategy to create even greater value in the communities where we operate. This has included celebrating the 10th anniversary of IMPACT Day in May, with employees volunteering more than 7,900 hours on 76 projects to support local communities, including 19 projects supporting Habitat for Humanity.
instruction to give students the knowledge and skills required for logistics sector careers, from forklift operators to customer service advisors, automation engineers and data analysts.
Sustainable building features include solar thermal and photovoltaic generation, an underground rainwater harvesting tank and 10 EV charging stations. The reception area, cafe, training rooms and meeting rooms feature an industrial feel with high ceilings, abundant natural light and natural greenery. The outdoor spaces feature hard and soft landscaping and seating for breakout sessions and relaxation.
On our annual IMPACT Day, we close our offices and encourage every employee to participate in a volunteer event in the region where they work.
Delivering significant added value through a project like this is a statement of the value we place on the community. Our customers also benefit when community members see benefits beyond what they would normally expect.

SASB Disclosure. 
Prologis supports the mission of the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), which creates industry-specific sustainability accounting standards that help companies disclose financially material, decision-useful environmental, social and governance (ESG) information to investors. This is the fourth year that Prologis is disclosing data using SASB’s 2018 Real Estate Standard. The following table contains our disclosure on the topics included in that standard. Activity metrics that may assist in the accurate evaluation and comparability of disclosure may be found throughout the Prologis 2021-22 ESG Report.
CODE ACCOUNTING METRIC PROLOGIS INFORMATION. 
Energy Management. 
IF-RE-130a.1 Energy consumption data coverage as a percentage of total floor area, by property subsector. 
Energy consumption data coverage from the global Prologis operating portfolio, as a percentage of floor area was equal to 40% in 2021.
IF-RE-130a.2 (1) Total energy consumed by portfolio area with data coverage, (2) percentage grid electricity, and (3) percentage renewable, by property subsector. 
From the portfolio with available energy data coverage from 2021 the following details pertain to energy: (1) The total energy consumption: 3,581,699 MWh (2) Percentage grid electricity: 55% (3) Percentage of electricity that is renewable (Logistics/Distribution Warehouse): 11%
IF-RE-130a.3 Like-for-like percentage change in energy consumption for the portfolio area with data coverage, by property subsector. 
Like-for-like change in energy consumption for the global Prologis operating portfolio was a 22.79% increase from 2020 to 2021. Fluctuations in occupancy, hours of operation, changes in customer mix, and increased e-commerce demand likely led to this increase.
IF-RE-130a.4 Percentage of eligible portfolio that (1) has an energy rating and (2) is certified to ENERGY STAR, by property subsector. 
Prologis has a goal to certify 100% of new developments and redevelopments to sustainable building certification standards. These sustainable building certification standards incorporate energy efficiency features, as well as other features for water efficiency, waste reduction, and others that promote tenant health and well-being, to name a few. Prologis is undertaking a project to review the energy ratings across our global portfolio. Given our asset class and building type we do not typically submit for EnergyStar certification. However, in certain regions like Europe where Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) are required to be maintained by various country requirements we manage the EPCs to maintain local compliance.
IF-RE-130a.5 Description of how building energy management considerations are integrated into property investment analysis and operational strategy. 
Prologis integrates energy and water reduction technologies into our new buildings as part or our goal to have 100% of new development and redevelopment achieve sustainable building certification. These strategies ensure the resilience and enduring value of our buildings, creating value for our customers and our company. In addition, Prologis has a customer centric approach focused on helping further the operational efficiency of our customers. We have sustainability solutions available through our Essentials marketplace, and we also allocate a portion of our CAPEX for existing buildings to LED lighting retrofits and other energy-saving technologies, water-saving features, cool roofing technology and solar installations.

CODE ACCOUNTING METRIC PROLOGIS INFORMATION. 
Water Management. 
IF-RE-140a.1, IF-RE-140a.2, IFRE-140a.3 (a.1) Water withdrawal data coverage as a percentage of (1) total floor area and (2) floor area in regions with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress, by property subsector. (a.2) Total water withdrawn by portfolio area with data coverage and (2) percentage in regions with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress, by property subsector (a.3) Like-for-like percentage change in water withdrawn for portfolio area with data coverage, by property subsector. 
Water withdrawals from logistics facilities are typically lower compared to other types of buildings, and thus less material than energy and emissions. (1) For 2021, we report on data available on water consumption across a portion of our global offices. In 2021, we had water consumption reporting from 25 of our global corporate offices, with 18.7 million gallons consumed. We continue to work to improve data coverage. Like-for-like change in water consumption was available for 10 offices that had both 2020 and 2021 data. From the water data provided by the 10 offices with like-for-like data there was a 15% increase in water withdrawals from 2020 to 2021. (2) At this time, we have not completed a full mapping of water stress, but Prologis is using third-party data and internal tools for mapping and evaluating physical climate risk exposure at the asset level through science-based climate scenarios. Based on the data of our physical climate risk assessments we can proactively implement mitigation strategies that further the resilience of our global portfolio. This includes implementing site specific mitigation measures, such as raising a property out of the base flood elevation, raising the height of dock doors, and other measures to ensure the long-term resilience of our assets.
IF-RE-140a.4 Description of water management risks and discussion of strategies and practices to mitigate those risks. 
Even though logistics facilities typically have a lower water footprint compared to other types of buildings, we have adopted various sustainable water management practices and technologies to minimize water use and the impact of our assets on water quality. Many of these efforts are a result of pursuing sustainable building certifications for 100% of new developments and redevelopments globally. All of our water-related actions are project-specific, taking into account the site's soil conditions, rainfall patterns, topography and infrastructure. Inside our buildings, we install low-flow toilets and motion-activated faucets to reduce consumption. Outside, we landscape using native plants that are adapted to the local climate and require limited additional watering. Many of our buildings also capture rainwater that is used when irrigation is required. We continually monitor the evolution of water-management technologies, seeking to pass cost savings on to our customers.
Management of Tenant Sustainability Impacts. 
IF-RE-410a.1 (1) Percentage of new leases that contain a cost recovery clause for resource efficiency-related capital improvements and (2) associated leased floor area, by property subsector. 
Within the Prologis Clear Lease® we have adopted green lease language that seeks to better collaborate with our customers in sharing data, as well as providing options to install systems that can help our customers to operate more efficiently and sustainably, such as solar. In the future we may have more quantifiable metrics on the coverage of our portfolio with leases that specifically contain cost recovery clauses for resource efficiency-related capital improvements.
IF-RE-410a.2 Percentage of tenants that are separately metered or submetered for (1) grid electricity consumption and (2) water withdrawals, by property subsector. 
Prologis is in the process of expanding our global data gathering systems and evaluating various solutions, including submeter systems for our various tenant spaces. Within the Prologis Clear Lease® we have adopted green lease language that seeks to better collaborate with our customers in sharing data, as well as providing options to install systems that can help our customers to operate more efficiently and sustainably. In the future we may have more quantifiable metrics on the coverage for spaces that are using these types of metering systems.
IF-RE-410a.3 Discussion of approach to measuring, incentivizing, and improving sustainability impacts of tenants. 
Prologis works with a third-party data collection consultant to track customer energy consumption for our global portfolio. Prologis Essentials LED is a program dedicated to collaborating with customers to accelerate LED lighting upgrades that improve the operational efficiency of our customers' businesses, and decrease customer energy consumption and associated emissions. 57% of our portfolio had LED lighting at the end of 2021. Our modern, efficient and resilient building design saves money for our customers and minimizes impacts on our communities. Our focus on urban locations allows our customers to meet consumer expectations around expedited delivery, while also reducing overall transportation emissions from shortened delivery distances. By incorporating ESG concepts into our lease agreements, deploying sustainability solutions through the Prologis Essentials Marketplace and providing our customers with information packets that include sustainable practices, Prologis improves the sustainability impacts of our customers. We monitor local benchmarking ordinances and work with our property management team to educate customers on how utility data collection can be automated.

Climate Change Adaption. 
IF-RE-450a.1 Area of properties located in 100-year flood zones, by property subsector. 
Using third-party data and internal tools for mapping and evaluating physical climate risk exposure at the asset level through science-based climate scenarios, we can proactively implement mitigation strategies that further the resilience of our global portfolio. This includes implementing site specific mitigation measures, such as raising a property out of the base flood elevation, raising the height of dock doors, and other measures to ensure the long-term resilience of our assets. Disclosing a metric on the area of properties within 100-year flood zones would need additional context to understand the site-specific mitigation measures that have been put in place to lower the associated risk from the flood zone. We will continue to explore additional disclosure of this data in response to stakeholder feedback.
IF-RE-450a.2 Description of climate change risk exposure analysis, degree of systematic portfolio exposure, and strategies for mitigating risks. 
Prologis takes a proactive approach to assessing natural hazards and climate exposures across our portfolio, including earthquakes, windstorms, floods and coastal exposure. Prologis’ Risk Management team is actively evaluating our portfolio exposure to ensure that we have sufficient coverage and protection for our buildings, as well as using third-party data to look ahead and evaluate climate scenarios that may impact our properties in the future. These assessments allow us to determine the appropriate risk mitigation measures for our portfolio and plan for longer term trends. We take preventative measures to improve the resiliency of our buildings to promote business continuity in our customers’ operations. As a result of our long-term planning, resiliency measures implemented and diverse portfolio footprint, we believe impacts to our portfolio arising from climate change are well-managed.

2021-22 ESG Report 55 2021 TCFD Disclosure. 
Prologis’ approach to identifying and managing climate-related risks and opportunities in line with the recommendation of the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD) encompasses: • Dynamic risk management strategy focused on resiliency • Evaluating physical climate risk exposure at the asset level using science-based climate scenarios • Following a Science Based Target (SBT) for determining greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction targets across scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. 
Prologis has an established track record of ensuring its portfolio remains resilient for its customers and stakeholders. This commitment not only focuses on acute, nearterm risks such as hurricanes and flooding, but also considers longer-term trends resulting from the changing climate. We develop assets with a long-term ownership horizon in mind and have preparedness plans in place that have consistently differentiated our response and helped us to deliver business continuity to our customers. Looking forward, we are working with third parties on climate-related scenario analysis to evaluate the exposure of our global assets to physical, natural hazards across our portfolio, and to ensure we continue to be prepared for changes in frequency and severity of extreme weather events. Other components include being a listed TCFD supporter, TCFD-aligned public disclosures, engagement from our executive team and board members in evaluating climate-related risks through briefings by the ESG and Risk Management groups, and a robust program to track our efforts through metrics and targets, including our approved SBT. For our SBT we are beginning the process of updating our target to align with the 1.5 degree Celsius scenario as part of our commitment to net zero across our value chain by 2040. Our updated SBT will guide our transition to a low-carbon future by reducing GHG emissions across our operations, portfolio of assets and throughout our value chain.
Governance The organization’s governance around climate-related risks and opportunities.
• Risk, including climate-related risks, are part of the Prologis board’s oversight responsibility. Board updates have focused on Prologis’ climate-related physical risk assessments, coastal risks, as well as ESG progress on GHG reductions and the expansion of our sustainability offering for customers (e.g. solar installations, etc.).
• Our chief legal officer and general counsel oversees both the Risk Management and. 
ESG teams with broad support and engagement across the entire organization. One example is our structured Investment Committee process, overseen by our Executive Committee, that requires risks and ESG considerations be evaluated for every investment decision. Furthermore, Prologis’ new chief energy and sustainability officer reports directly to our chief operating officer and leads the sustainability program that will help our customers transition to a low-carbon future.
Strategy & risk management The actual and potential impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organization’s businesses, strategy and financial planning.
The processes used by the organization to identify, assess and manage climate-related risks.
• Prologis is a long-term owner of logistics real estate. This requires us to evaluate material risks and opportunities that may arise over the short- (out to 2030), medium- (2030-2040) and long-term (2040-2050) time horizons, as well as risks that are acute or chronic, including those associated with climate change. Evaluating risks and opportunities and the potential financial implications ensure the resilience of our assets and our customers operations, while also identifying opportunities to deliver sustainable solutions to our customers.

We also account for these risks and opportunities in our Investment. 
Committee process.
• Prologis takes a proactive and customer centric approach to mitigate our exposure to risks and create sustainable solutions that benefit our customers: — Products and services – Examples include the Prologis Essentials LED lighting program that helps our customers to lower energy costs and have more efficient operations by upgrading to highly efficient LED lighting that can lower energy costs by 60% to 80%.
— Supply chain and/or value chain – Our SolarSmart program enables our customers to utilize onsite renewable energy for their operations, lowering the emissions from their supply chain, as well as from our value chain. Solar installations on our rooftops are also adding more renewable energy into the local utility grids of regions we operate in. – Prologis is supporting its customers in the transition to electric vehicles by incorporating EV infrastructure into our new developments. We are also developing a turnkey solution to help customers transition to EVs within our existing buildings, while also establishing collaborative partnerships with local utilities.
— Operations (including types of operations and location of facilities) – Responsible investment practices advance green design principles and mitigate environmental, climate and other ESG risks. – Our portfolio is diversified across multiple geographies in 19 countries minimizing the material risk to our portfolio from any one asset being exposed to a particular physical climate-related risk. – Using third-party data and internal tools for mapping and evaluating physical climate risk exposure at the asset level through science-based climate scenarios, we can proactively implement mitigation strategies that further the resilience of our global portfolio. This includes implementing site specific mitigation measures, such as raising a property out of the base flood elevation, raising the height of dock doors, and other measures to ensure the long-term resilience of our assets.
— Adaptation and mitigation activities – Local and regional teams are equipped with disaster response plans and take various risks into consideration when developing or maintaining our assets to make sure that they are resilient to climate-related risks like flooding or extreme weather events. – We implement site specific mitigation measures, some examples include: raising properties out of the base flood elevation and raising the height of dock doors;
