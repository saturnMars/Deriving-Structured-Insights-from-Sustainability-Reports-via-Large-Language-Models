Zero CO2 Emissions Throughout the Entire Vehicle Life Cycle in the Future. 
To mitigate the various risks posed by climate change, the Life Cycle Zero CO2 Emissions Challenge seeks to completely eliminate CO2 emissions not only during driving (TtW2), but throughout the entire vehicle life cycle including materials, parts and vehicle manufacturing, logistics, disposal and recycling. Some electrified vehicles may have materials and parts that increase CO2 emissions in the processes of manufacturing. Possible means of reducing these emissions include adopting low CO2 emitting materials during manufacturing, components downsizing, and introducing renewable energy. We will reduce CO2 emissions in the disposal and recycling stages by expanding use of recycled materials and designs that make it easier to dismantle vehicles. We will accelerate eco-friendly designs as we pursue “ever-better cars” in the future. We are working to accelerate efforts for reducing CO2 emissions on a global scale while engaging in even closer communication with parties in the value chains including suppliers and dealers. We will also promote reductions in CO2 through the efficient use of mobility by providing mobility services and supporting the widespread adoption of eco driving. Through these initiatives, we will contribute to achieving Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 12.8 (sustainable lifestyles) and 13.1 (reduction of CO2).
Completely Eliminate All CO2 Emissions Throughout the Entire Vehicle Life Cycle.

I would like to begin by sending my deepest condolences to the families who have lost loved ones to COVID-19 and to everyone who has suffered from this disease and is experiencing uncertain and difficult times. Also, I express my heartfelt thanks and deep respect to healthcare professionals who work day and night on the front lines responding to COVID-19, including national and local governments.
I made the following statement at the FY2020 Financial Results Press Conference in May: “I believe that our mission is to provide goods and services that make people throughout the world happy, or, in other words, to ‘mass produce’ happiness. In achieving this, I believe that it is necessary to cultivate Toyota people in the world, human resources that have a ‘YOU perspective,’ who can wish for and take action for the happiness of those other than themselves. I view this as also being a part of earnestly engaging in the SDGs, for which international society is aiming, with the stance of ‘no one will be left behind.’” “How we, as human beings and as companies, should live our lives.” The crisis made me think about this, and the above statement was intended to convey my thinking.
Until now, Toyota has committed itself in solving many issues that society faces through manufacturing. As a part of those efforts, we have been promoting responses to electrification based on the belief that environmental technologies can contribute to society when they come into widespread use, in the environmental fields.
In 2015, we announced the Toyota Environmental Challenge 2050 with the aim of realizing a sustainable society. We have promoted to further popularize electrified vehicles and to minimize the environmental loads of the vehicle manufacturing process itself.
At the beginning of this year, five years after this announcement, we set out a plan to build a prototype city of the future called the Woven City, and take on the challenge of realizing a hydrogen-based society. Of course, Toyota cannot do this alone and achieving it will depend on cohesively leveraging mobility and infrastructure. We would like to collaborate with like-minded partners to create a blueprint for an eco-friendly society that is not reliant on fossil fuels.
We all live on the same earth. Toyota takes action from the perspective of our “Home Planet,” above and beyond concepts of “home town” and “home country.” The current working generation are responsible for bequeathing this beautiful home for future generations, as a place where they can live safely. I hope to create opportunities for future generations to look back and say, “We are where we are today thanks to the people back then.” It is with this shared aspiration of the current generation that I wish to make ever greater efforts.

Prioritization We conducted a comparative assessment along two-axes—relevance to stakeholders and importance to Toyota—based on communications with stakeholders including experts, investors and NGOs in Japan and overseas as well as internal discussions.
STEP 2. 
Identification of Issues We identified global environmental issues that we should address in light of Toyota’s principles and values as well as management environment (social and competitor trends and status of internal strategies and actions). STEP 1. 
Environmental issues may entail both business risks and opportunities. It is therefore essential to identify key issues from both risk and opportunity perspectives when formulating environmental strategies. In order to grasp the potential risks and opportunities, Toyota has identified and assessed global environmental issues from the standpoints of relevance to stakeholders and importance to our business.
Analysis Process. 
We reflect the key issues identified through environmental materiality analysis in short- to long-term strategies and action plans including the Toyota Environmental Challenge 2050 and the Toyota Environmental Action Plan. Environmental materiality was reviewed at timing of recent formulation of the 2025 Target (Seventh Toyota Environmental Action Plan) in accordance with the above process. In addition, TMC and six regions (North America, Europe, China, Asia, South America and South Africa) embodied those targets from global and regional perspectives under an integrated process.
Reflection in Environmental Strategies. 
Validation We established a common understanding between Toyota Motor Corporation (TMC) and all regions at the global meetings also based on the analyses conducted by overseas affiliates. We also engaged in dialogue with international organizations to validate the issues identified from perspectives outside of the company. The matrix was confirmed by relevant executives.
STEP 3. 
Review Process We review the environmental materiality once every five years at the timing of the formulation of the five-year action plan. If there are any major shifts in society or Toyota, we will conduct flexible reviews regardless of the regular interval. STEP 4.

Risks and Opportunities and Scenario Analysis Relating to Climate Change. 
Toyota strives to identify the various risks and opportunities that will arise from environmental issues, takes action while continuously confirming the validity of strategies such as the Toyota Environmental Challenge 2050 and works to enhance its competitiveness. Within these efforts, we believe that tightening regulations as measures against climate change and adopting new technologies will be necessary in various areas. As climate change advances, it is expected that temperatures will increase, ocean levels will rise and natural disasters including typhoons and flooding will become more severe. These changes may have various impacts on Toyota’s business fields. These impacts may also pose risks to Toyota’s business, but it is our understanding that if we can respond appropriately, this will lead to enhanced competitiveness and the acquisition of new business opportunities. Based on this understanding, we have organized the risks relating to climate change and identified particularly significant risks in light of the degree of impact and the level of interest by stakeholders. Toyota supports the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and appropriately discloses information concerning risks and opportunities related to climate change and their analyses.

13 Environmental Report 2020. 
As climate change measures proceeds, there is a possibility that the automobile industry and the entire mobility society will be exposed to substantial changes. These changes will present both risks and opportunities to Toyota. We set multiple images of society in 2030 as Toyota’s external environment based on the International Energy Agency (IEA) scenarios and others, in light of risk and opportunity analysis. With regard to the IEA scenarios, we put focus on the 2°C scenario (2DS) and pictured future images in cases where climate change measures do not progress and where climate change measures progress further (B2DS).
STEP 1 Set Future Images Assuming Climate Change Effects. 
We examined the impacts on Toyota for each of the future images developed in STEP 1. No matter what type of society develops in 2030, the global market for the new vehicles will expand, but in a society where climate change measures progress further, the percentage of electrified vehicles and ZEVs in use will increase. With regard to effects on production and purchasing, introduction of and increases in carbon pricing may lead to higher purchasing and production costs, while promoting energy-saving and introducing renewable energy and hydrogen will mitigate risks. In addition, introducing the regulation of life cycle CO2 emissions will likely give rise to calls to take measures to reduce not just TtW1 emissions, but also WtW2 emissions. On the other hand, in the case where climate change measures are not adequate throughout society, production suspensions and supply chain disruptions are likely to increase as a result of increased frequency and severity of natural disasters such as flooding. Under the current analysis, B2DS under the IEA scenario is the scenario under which measures will progress the most, but it is our understanding that tighter regulations and technological advances will be called for more under the scenario where temperature increase is limited to 1.5°C than under B2DS.
1 Tank to Wheel: CO2 emissions during driving (CO2 emissions during the production stage of the fuel is not included; TtW emissions are zero in the case of battery electric vehicles and fuel cell electric vehicles) 2 Well to Wheel: Includes CO2 emissions during driving as well as CO2 emissions during the production stage of fuel and electricity (CO2 emissions vary depending on the power supply configuration and hydrogen production method in the case of battery electric vehicles and fuel cell electric vehicles)
STEP 2 Consider the Impacts on Toyota. 
Toyota will begin selling battery electric vehicles (BEVs) in China in 2020 and is promoting electrification from all directions including hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) and fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs). This strategy will allow for flexible and strategic responses to each demand for varying powertrains depending on the scenario as well as WtW emissions reductions optimized for each region by introducing BEVs in regions where the emission factors from electricity are low and promoting emissions reductions through HEVs in regions where the emission factors are high. By promoting real CO2 emissions reductions throughout the world through these types of initiatives, we are working to achieve New Vehicle Zero CO2 Emissions and Life Cycle Zero CO2 Emissions. We are also working towards Plant Zero CO2 Emissions in the production stage and reducing CO2 emissions through comprehensive energy-saving and introduction of renewable energy and hydrogen. With respect to renewable energy in particular, we have set a new target, achieve a 25 percent introduction rate for renewable electricity by 2025, and are actively working towards that target including announcing our entry into the renewable energy power generation business. With regard to the ongoing confirmation of the suitability and progress of Toyota’s strategies, we believe that we will have opportunities for stable funding and sustainable increases in corporate value through appropriate information disclosure, dialogue with institutional investors and other stakeholders and enhanced responses to various ESG assessment indicators.
STEP 3 Respond to Toyota’s Strategies. 
Scenario Analysis Assuming Risks and Opportunities. 
Three Different Images of Society as Toyota’s External Environment • Growth of conventional engine vehicles, electrified vehicles and ZEVs under BAU • Higher frequency and intensification of natural disasters such as flooding.

CSR Policy. 
We understand and commend each of the environmental challenges. However, we are unable to gain a clear, overall picture of Toyota’s initiatives and contributions to society. It is necessary for Toyota to present an overall image of solutions to various environmental and social issues. In particular, way to comprehensively solve energy and resource recycling issues.
We strive to present overall images of solutions to various environmental and social issues in the Environmental Report as well as the Annual Report and Sustainability Data Book. We will take additional actions to address energy and resource recycling issues in accordance with the 2025 Target.
Toyota declares in the preamble of the CSR Policy to manage interacting with all stakeholders in order to contribute to the sustainable society and endeavor to build and maintain sound relationships with stakeholders through open and fair communication. The CSR Policy identifies customers, employees, business partners, shareholders and global society and local communities as stakeholders. Of these, global society and local communities includes the residents, governments, economic and industry organizations, NGOs and NPOs, in the area where our offices all over the world are located. Toyota establishes a policy on the CSR Policy to build and maintain communications and relationships with each of these stakeholders. Based on these policies, our various relevant divisions and offices all over the world acts as the main contacts for dialogues with stakeholders on diverse objectives and topics. We share Toyota’s philosophy and also enhance mutual understanding. Please refer to the Sustainability Data Book for details of dialogues with each stakeholder.
In the area of environment, we believe that communication with global society and local communities made up of diverse parties is particularly important in the pursuit of establishing a future society in harmony with automobiles and nature. Based on this, we engage in dialogues primarily with experts, NGOs, assessment agencies, international organizations and government officials with the ability to disseminate information, while maintaining a solid understanding and holding insight regarding the ideal expected of the global society and local communities. Through such dialogues, we seek to impart understanding of Toyota’s environmental initiatives and build supportive and collaborative relationships while seeking valuable ideas on how we can further strengthen those initiatives. This policy was discussed and adopted in April 2019 at the Global Environment Meeting for general manager level employees of Toyota Motor Corporation (TMC) and regional environmental secretariats.
Main Stakeholder Groups and Fundamental Approach to Stakeholder Engagement Main Suggestions and Toyota’s Responses. 
In formulating the 2025 Target, we engaged in dialogues with various NGOs, assessment agencies, international organizations and government officials in FY2020, and examined the direction of our initiatives and reflected them in the plan. A stakeholder engagement dialogue held in Bangkok, Thailand is shared below as an example.

Environmental Management. 
Compliance Toyota and all of its consolidated subsidiaries undertake comprehensive risk management based on prevention in accordance with criteria that meet or exceed laws and regulations. If a violation occurs or a complaint is made, we have systems in place to respond in a timely manner, and we work to prevent reoccurrence through identification of root causes. In 2019, we were not involved in any major environmental incidents causing air or water pollution, nor was the Toyota Group subjected to any fines or penalties. However, there were two minor non-compliance issues on abnormal water quality in the production area and one minor non-compliance issue on waste in the non-production area, for which measures were implemented.
Ozone-depleting Substances We are taking measures to completely eliminate the use of ozone-depleting substances, and no significant releases have been found.
Air Pollution Measures: Expanded Verification Tests in California Freight trucks currently operate in coastal areas of the United States, releasing significant amount of carcinogens, diesel particulate matters (DPM) and other pollutants and causing serious problems for communities in the vicinity of the Port of Long Beach and Port of Los Angeles. To solve these problems, we conducted verification tests toward the practical use of heavy-duty commercial fuel cell (FC) electric trucks. Toyota is working with various partners to improve the global atmospheric environments by expanding the use of hydrogen.
Risk Management. 
At Toyota, Operating Officers and executives make timely decisions and carry out environmental initiatives from positions that are closer to customers and worksites under the supervision of the Board of Directors.

At the end of FY2020, research groups summarized the activities of the study sessions in the first term and shared the results among the Kyohokai members.
Green Purchasing Guidelines. 
Value Chains Collaboration. 
Toyota has strong bonds of trust with its dealers and distributors built on shared values for products and services. With respect to environmental activities, in 2016 we established the Environmental Global Policy in the Sales and Service Area and all dealers and distributors globally implemented four steps according to local conditions: establishing a structure of environmental system, minimization of environmental risks, improvement of environmental performance and activities to make environment better with customers and society.
Initiatives with Suppliers. 
Recognition of Supplier’s Environmental Initiatives We established the Environmental Activity Awards in FY2018 to commend suppliers that conduct exceptional environmental initiatives and has presented the awards every year.
CDP2 Supply Chain Program We introduced the CDP Supply Chain Program in FY2016 to support continuous environmental initiatives conducted with suppliers. The program enables us to determine supplier’s risks, opportunities and their initiatives on climate change and water security. Each year we create opportunities for environmental communication by holding briefing sessions and response guidance where we share information on social trends and Toyota’s initiatives and provide feedback on response results. The scope of subject suppliers has been increasing every year, and in FY2020, suppliers accounting for approximately 84 percent of the total purchasing value were covered by the program. Based on the self-assessment results, we confirmed that approximately two-thirds of suppliers had reduced CO2 intensity (total emissions/net revenues) compared to the previous year.

18 Environmental Report 2020. 
Extreme weather phenomena around the world are wreaking havoc on society, attesting to the reality of climate change. If adequate measures are not taken, the harm will become even more severe, and the risks of global-scale damage have been pointed out. Under these circumstances, the Paris Agreement, which came into effect in 2016, sets long-term goals to hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. As the world moves to curtail temperature increase, Toyota sees this situation as both a risk and an opportunity and will strive to reduce average CO2 emissions per vehicle during driving by 90 percent compared to 2010 levels by 2050 under the New Vehicle Zero CO2 Emissions Challenge. Based on the idea that eco-friendly vehicles contribute to the environment only when they come into widespread use, we are not only deploying technologies for conventional engine vehicles, but also accelerating advances in technology and its widespread adoption for the electrified vehicles that Toyota has been developing (including hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs)). We are committed to continuing working hand in hand with stakeholders to build the necessary infrastructure that supports the widespread use of BEVs and FCEVs. Through these initiatives, we will contribute to achieving Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7.3 (improvement in energy efficiency) and 13.1 (reduction of CO2).

Eco-friendly Vehicles Contribute to the Environment only when They Come into Widespread Use—Results in Europe CO2 Emissions Reduction Efforts with Other Industries. 
Promoting the Development and Widespread Use of Electrified Vehicles World Premiere of the UX 300e, the First Lexus BEV Production Model. 
The UX 300e, the first Lexus BEV model for market launch. 
In the process of seeking dedicated electrified vehicles and electric options, at the Tokyo Motor Show 2019, Lexus announced its global electrification strategy, called “Lexus Electrified,” which targets driver enjoyment. The UX 300e is scheduled to go on sale in China, Europe and other regions in phases starting in 2020, with sales in Japan slated to start in the first half of 2021.
Tightening of major environmental regulations relating to automobiles has been seen in many countries in recent years. Tightening of CO2 regulations has been accelerating within Europe in particular, a major market for Toyota new vehicle sales. In 2018, Toyota’s average CO2 emissions from new vehicles were 102.1 g/km, substantially better than the regulatory standards and the best level in the industry. We believe that this was the result of electrified vehicles—mainly hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs)—reaching 58 percent of all sales thanks to the improved fuel efficiency and enhanced marketability. Since the launch of the Prius in 1997, we have continuously made technological innovations and refined mass production technologies. We will continue to leverage these Toyota’s strengths to expand the lineup of vehicles that customers choose.
Toyota achieved the Sixth Toyota Environmental Action Plan of cumulative sales of 15 million electrified vehicles by 2020 ahead of schedule. As of March 2020, the CO2 emissions reduction effects from the introduction of electrified vehicles have reached approximately 125 million tons. And, in the 2025 Target, announced in April 2020, we set a target of cumulative sales of 30 million electrified vehicles or more by 2025, and will continue working toward the widespread use of electrified vehicles. We also announced the challenges toward the widespread use of electrified vehicles which aims to expand dedicated electrified models and electric options and have no vehicles available only as an engine model globally by around 2025. We will expand the product lineup according to customer needs while seeking global sales of more than 5.5 million electrified vehicles including 1 million or more battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs), which are ZEVs*, by 2030.
* Zero Emission Vehicles: Vehicles that have the potential not to emit any CO2 during driving such as battery electric vehicles and fuel cell electric vehicles. 
In 2019, Seven-Eleven Japan Co., Ltd. and Toyota launched a joint next-generation convenience store project toward greater CO2 emissions reduction. The project aims to introduce technologies and systems developed by Toyota in Seven-Eleven store operation and distribution, reducing CO2 emissions. Stationary fuel cell (FC) generators and rechargeable batteries are being introduced at stores and centrally managed by building energy management systems to reduce CO2 emissions by raising the proportion of renewable energy and electric power derived from hydrogen used. In distribution, the objective is to achieve zero emissions of substances of concern including CO2 by introducing a newly developed small FC electric truck.

Fundamental Approach. 
The Plant Zero CO2 Emissions Challenge seeks zero CO2 emissions in the vehicle manufacturing process. To achieve this, Toyota is undertaking the introduction of innovative technologies and daily kaizen as well as the introduction of renewable energy and utilization of hydrogen. First of all, processes and the time required were reduced by simplifying and streamlining manufacturing processes, which made an improvement to energy use efficiency, including equipment optimization and the use of waste heat. Furthermore, we use every possible means to reduce CO2 emissions including introducing an innovative process called karakuri that does not consume any energy source at all. In addition, we will effectively utilize renewable energy such as solar power and wind power along with hydrogen energy, and we are committed to continuing working hand in hand with stakeholders to build the necessary social infrastructure to support the widespread use of these energy sources. Through these initiatives, we will contribute to achieving Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7.2 (introduction of renewable energy), 7.3 (improvement in energy efficiency), 9.1 (infrastructure development), 9.4 (sustainable industrial processes), and 13.1 (reduction of CO2).

Development of World’s First General-purpose Hydrogen Burner. 
As a result of the rising demand for automobiles and the progress of vehicle electrification, plant CO2 emissions under BAU are expected to increase in the future. Toyota is taking action to reduce total CO2 emissions, by working on both the energy-saving by introduction of innovative technologies and daily kaizen and the introduction of renewable energy and utilization of hydrogen with the aim of achieving zero CO2 emissions from all global plants by 2050.
Toyota is promoting the introduction of renewable energy, taking into consideration the characteristics of each country and region. We are currently constructing wind power generating facilities (21.5 MW) at the Tahara Plant in Japan and actively introducing renewable energy generating facilities at other Toyota plants. In 2019, these facilities generated approximately 160,000 MWh of electric power. We have achieved a 100 percent renewable electricity introduction rate at all plants in Europe and four plants in South America as well as on the Mirai fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV) production line in Japan. Also, due to the rising use of electricity derived from natural energy in recent years, hydrogen holds great promise as a means of suppressing supply and demand variation in energy and for energy storage and transportation. Toyota is participating in the Hydrogen Utilization Study Group in the Chubu and other initiatives to create mechanisms for the use of hydrogen energy throughout society and is contributing to the realization of a decarbonized society. With respect to the utilization of hydrogen at plants, we are developing hydrogen burners that can decarbonize the combustion process, expanding the use of fuel cell (FC) forklifts, installing generators that run on hydrogen fuel, and conducting verifications.
Toyota developed a new paint atomizer (airless paint atomizer) that uses static electricity instead of air to replace the conventional air paint atomizers used in the vehicle body painting process. The newly developed airless painter uses first of its kind in the world new technology to improve coating efficiency (the amount of paint sprayed versus the amount that actually adheres to the vehicle body) to 95 percent or more, the highest in the world, from conventional efficiency of approximately 60 to 70 percent. By deploying the airless paint atomizer in the Toyota Group’s painting process, it is expected that the Group can reduce its CO2 emissions by approximately seven percent.
The practical use of hydrogen burners has proved challenging since they generate large amounts of nitrogen oxides (NOx) during combustion. The newly developed burners incorporate two new structures that enable hydrogen to combust more slowly and greatly reduced NOx emissions. The world’s first2 general-purpose hydrogen burner for industrial use, has been introduced at the Honsha Plant. This will make it possible to achieve zero CO2 emissions by utilizing hydrogen in processes that use combustion such as furnaces.
2 As of November 2018, according to Toyota data. 
In 2019, Toyota’s plant manufacturing departments worked with production engineering and drive force departments to conduct energy diagnoses at production sites, propose improvements and implement measures. We continuously undertook energy-saving activities (internal ESCO activities) and yokoten* of best practices. Also, the introduction of innovative technologies was expanded with a focus on painting processes and energy-saving was promoted by adopting steamless and airless processes and shifting to LED lighting. As a result, we reduced global CO2 emissions (total) to 5.68 million tons (down 8.9 percent compared to 2013 levels). We also conducted study sessions with Toyota Group companies and suppliers to share know-how on energy-saving measures, and that information has been reflected in improvements implemented by those companies. We also observed other industries and are continuously seeking to discover new ideas for kaizen.
* Yokoten: Refers to sharing of best practices with other divisions. 
Toyota, Chubu Electric Power Co., Inc. and Toyota Tsusho Corporation established Toyota Green Energy LLP. The new company will acquire and operate renewable energy sources in Japan and will supply electric power to all the Toyota Group companies in the future. The clean electric power to be supplied through this business will lead to zero CO2 emissions in production activities.

Zero CO2 Emissions Throughout the Entire Vehicle Life Cycle in the Future. 
To mitigate the various risks posed by climate change, the Life Cycle Zero CO2 Emissions Challenge seeks to completely eliminate CO2 emissions not only during driving (TtW2), but throughout the entire vehicle life cycle including materials, parts and vehicle manufacturing, logistics, disposal and recycling. Some electrified vehicles may have materials and parts that increase CO2 emissions in the processes of manufacturing. Possible means of reducing these emissions include adopting low CO2 emitting materials during manufacturing, components downsizing, and introducing renewable energy. We will reduce CO2 emissions in the disposal and recycling stages by expanding use of recycled materials and designs that make it easier to dismantle vehicles. We will accelerate eco-friendly designs as we pursue “ever-better cars” in the future. We are working to accelerate efforts for reducing CO2 emissions on a global scale while engaging in even closer communication with parties in the value chains including suppliers and dealers. We will also promote reductions in CO2 through the efficient use of mobility by providing mobility services and supporting the widespread adoption of eco driving. Through these initiatives, we will contribute to achieving Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 12.8 (sustainable lifestyles) and 13.1 (reduction of CO2).

Promoting Environmental Management for Product Development (Eco-VAS)
Measures to Achieve Zero CO2 Emissions During Vehicle Manufacturing. 
To reduce the environmental impact of its vehicles, we have introduced the Eco-Vehicle Assessment System (Eco-VAS) to set and convey environmental targets such as life cycle CO2 emissions and recyclability, under the guidance of the chief engineer, starting in the development stage and has used LCA1 to assess environmental impact. Some electrified vehicles achieve lower CO2 emissions during driving (TtW2), but have higher emissions during the materials and vehicle manufacturing processes. Because of this, we believe that it is crucial to reduce environmental load not only during driving (TtW), but throughout the vehicle life cycle.
1 Life Cycle Assessment: A comprehensive technique to assess vehicle’s impact on the environment throughout the entire life cycle from resource mining to disposal and recycling, by quantifying the impact of each stage 2 Tank to Wheel: CO2 emissions during driving (CO2 emissions during the production stage of the fuel is not included; TtW emissions are zero in the case of battery electric vehicles and fuel cell electric vehicles)
Toyota is reducing CO2 emissions with the aim of achieving zero CO2 emissions at global plants by 2050. There is a tendency, however, for CO2 emissions to increase during the manufacturing of electrified vehicles, such as fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs), regarding which are expected to gain in popularity. To address this issue, in 2019 we introduced electric power generated 100 percent from renewable electricity on FCEV production lines for the assembly and key components (high-pressure hydrogen tanks and fuel cell (FC) stacks). As a result, CO2 emissions during production have been drastically reduced.
Toward a Realistic CO2 Emissions Reduction During Electrified Vehicle Driving (WtW3)
Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) do not emit CO2 during driving (TtW), but the amount of CO2 released varies depending on the generation method of the electricity used for charging. For example, unlike thermal electric power generation, solar power does not involve the combustion of fossil fuels during power generation, and consequently CO2 emissions are zero. In regions where the proportion of electricity generated from this type of renewably energy is high, CO2 emissions from BEVs calculated on a WtW basis are low. In light of this, Toyota is pursuing electrification from all directions, making possible electrified vehicle lineups optimized for each region, and contributing to real reductions in CO2 emissions based on the WtW concept.
3 Well to Wheel: Includes CO2 emissions during driving as well as CO2 emissions during the production stage of fuel and electricity (CO2 emissions vary depending on the power supply configuration and hydrogen production method in the case of battery electric vehicles and fuel cell electric vehicles).
Responding to Scope 3. 
Scope 3 assesses not just CO2 emissions from the corporate activities of the company and its consolidated subsidiaries (Scope 1 and 2), but also CO2 emissions from various stages, such as the purchase of materials and parts, transportation, employee commuting and business travel, along with the driving, maintenance and disposal of customer vehicles. The scope of calculation was set to lead to future reductions in emissions. Toyota is undertaking the Life Cycle Zero CO2 Emissions Challenge, also leading to reductions in Scope 3 CO2 emissions.

Three Sites in Thailand Collaborate to Reduce CO2 Emissions by 4.5 Percent (Year on Year)
Plants at three sites in Thailand are collaborating to reduce CO2 emissions in logistics. They improved transportation efficiency by relocating the logistics hub to the most efficient site based on the relative positions of the plants, dealers and ports. Transportation volumes were also improved by steadily replacing trucks with models with larger loading capacity. Various other measures are also being continuously implemented such as installing driving monitors to instill eco driving minds among drivers and effectively using empty trucks. As a result, CO2 emissions were reduced by 4.5 percent (956 tons) year on year.
Pursuing Transportation Efficiency and Reducing CO2 Emissions in Logistics Activities. 
To reduce CO2 emissions in logistics activities, Toyota is taking measures to improve the transportation efficiency of production parts, completed vehicles and other goods. In 2019, despite ongoing measures including expanding retrieval logistics areas, improving loading efficiency and modal shifts from truck to railway, CO2 emissions in Japan from logistics operations in 2019 were 292,000 tons (up 1 percent year on year) due largely to an increase in volume and a higher production rate in remote locations. We will fully analyze these results and continuously work to further improve transportation efficiency.

Water problems such as increases in water stress in conjunction with rising populations and climate change as well as stricter regulations in response to deterioration of water quality in rivers and other water sources are important issues from the perspective of risks in corporate activities. Water is used in painting and other car manufacturing processes. This makes it imperative to reduce the impact on the water environment, to whatever degree possible. While there are significant differences in the characteristics of the water environment depending on the region, we have two main strategies regardless of the region: thoroughly reduce the amount of water usage and purify wastewater thoroughly and return. We have implemented various initiatives such as collecting rainwater to reduce industrial water usage, cutting water usage in production processes, recycling wastewater to reduce amounts withdrawn from water sources and returning high-quality water to local environments. In the future, we will undertake measures that have a positive impact on local water environments, taking into consideration the local requests and water issues. Through these initiatives, we will contribute to achieving Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6.3 (improvement in water quality) and 6.4 (ensuring water resources).

Substantial Reduction in Water Usage During Painting (China)
Washing process before painting. 
Sichuan FAW Toyota Motor Co., Ltd. (SFTM), a production affiliate in China, reduced water usage in body painting pre-processing (electrodeposition processing). SFTM implemented various measures in parallel including extending the useful life of cleaning water, reducing the amount of pure water used and promoting wastewater recycling to reduce water usage per vehicle produced by 142 liters and annual water usage by 170,000 m3.
Reduction of Water Usage According to the Actual Water Environment in Each Region and Water Quality Management. 
Toyota introduced innovative technologies in conjunction with planned upgrades to production lines, reduced the use of steam in manufacturing processes and implemented other measures, and as a result, water usage in 2019 was 44.0 million m3 (down 1.0 percent year on year) and water usage per vehicle produced was 4.1 m3 (down 2.4 percent year on year). We also assessed the impact of water environments at global plants, identified four Challenge-focused plants in North America, Asia and South Africa, and are now implementing comprehensive water management. With regard to the water quality discharged from plants, we assessed the impact on wastewater at each global plant where it is discharged directly into the river, set water discharge quality under internal standards that are stricter than regulatory standards and is continuously conducting water management. Moving ahead, we will continue striving to minimize our impacts on the water environment through water-saving and water recycling, and engage in activities that have positive effects on local water environments.

Although water-related issues and measures differ depending on the region, Toyota established the Toyota Water Environment Policy and takes action in order to achieve the Challenge of Minimizing and Optimizing Water Usage on a global level. Under the Toyota Water Environment Policy, we are assessing our impact on water environments and working to minimize those impacts from two perspectives: the input side, where we thoroughly reduce the amount of water usage, and the output side, where we purify wastewater thoroughly and return. We take action from three directions—the pursuit of environmental technologies, community-rooted operations and cooperation with society—and strive to become the No. 1 regional plant leading to prosperity throughout the entire society.
Painting Process Made Water-free Through Introduction of Innovative Technology (Japan)
Until now, large amounts of water have been used to recover the paint mist that did not adhere to vehicle bodies during the painting process. We developed a paint mist recovery technology that uses absorption by a dry filter, achieving the water usage in the painting process to zero. Since no water is used, the energy required to dehumidify the air in painting booths can also be drastically reduced. This technology has been adopted on the Prius and RAV4 production lines, and we plan to deploy it at other plants in the future.

Due to global population growth along with the pursuit of economic growth and convenient lifestyles, the pace of resource consumption is accelerating. If large-scale exploitation continues without change, natural resources will be depleted, and if waste increases due to mass consumption, appropriate disposal will be unable to keep pace, resulting in risks of environmental pollution. To prevent the environmental load caused by End-of-life vehicles, Toyota launched and has been promoting the Toyota Global 100 Dismantlers* Project, to establish social systems for appropriate treatment of End-of-life vehicle. On the other hand, to create a resource recycling-based society, in addition to responding to the risks of resource depletion and reducing substances of concern, it is necessary to grasp the possibility of creating business opportunities and to address recycling throughout the entire vehicle life cycle. We aim to realize the ultimate recycling-based society, and is promoting the Toyota Global Car-to-Car Recycle Project so that we can utilize resources from End-of-life vehicles for manufacturing new vehicles. Through these initiatives, we will contribute to achieving Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 9.1 (infrastructure development), 9.4 (sustainable industrial processes), 12.2 (sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources), 12.4 (management of wastes) and 12.5 (reduction of waste).

Toyota Global 100 Dismantlers Project Seeks to Establish Social Systems for Appropriate Treatment of End-of-life Vehicles. 
When End-of-life vehicles are not properly disposed or dismantled, it may not only affect local environments, but also causes risks to the health and safety of local residents. To prevent these problems, we promote the establishment of social systems for appropriate treatment of End-of-life vehicles, using our long-established technologies and know-how to not impose environmental load. In FY2020, we conducted surveys on the condition of End-of-life vehicles treatment in an island country and the infrastructure for proper treatment of CFC/HFC. In addition, we created a video manual on hydrogen gas removal to support appropriate treatment of fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs). We will continuously research the flow of End-of-life vehicles, setting treatment levels according to the conditions of national and regional infrastructures and work to establish model facilities in cooperation with local affiliates. Through the Toyota Global 100 Dismantlers Project, we are properly treating waste oil, fluid and CFC/HFC at model facilities. We will strive to establish recycling-based societies that enable efficient resource recycling by taking measures such as calling on national governments to ensure that such measures take root as social systems.
Achieve Industry-leading Levels in Easy-to-dismantle Design for Effective Resource Recycling. 
To promote material recycling of End-of-life vehicles, since launch of the Raum passenger car in 2003, we have been making direct visits to dismantling companies in Japan and overseas to investigate actual conditions. Based on this, we are actively adopting vehicle structures that makes it easy to dismantle and separate parts for new vehicles. The new RAV4, Corolla, Raize, Granace and Yaris launched in FY2020 adopted the TNGA*, a new concept for car manufacturing. We continue to incorporate easy-to-dismantle designs to these vehicles to ensure safe and speedy dismantling operations. In light of the recent situation in which many early model vehicles are transiting to the End-of-life stage, we placed an advertisement for the first time in trade papers and periodicals to highlight the ease of removing wiring harness, a representative example, in order to raise understanding on Toyota’s easy-to-dismantle designs for dismantling operators (starting in December 2019).
* Toyota New Global Architecture: Toyota’s company-wide global program to structurally transform automobile design. TNGA aims to dramatically improve the basic performance and marketability of Toyota vehicles by reforming and integrally redeveloping powertrain components and platforms.
Toyota Global Car-to-Car Recycle Project—A Recycling Initiative that Considers the Entire Vehicle Life Cycle. 
It is important to consider sustainability through the entire vehicle life cycle, from its production to the End-of-life. Therefore, Toyota reduces the generation of waste and repeatedly uses reusable materials in four stages of the vehicle life cycle: development and design, production, sales and disposal. We are also working to make waste recyclable. Since the early 1990s, we have been collecting and recycling bumpers generated through repair work at Toyota dealers as a way to reduce the usage of petroleum-based plastics. Also, to promote the reuse of rare resources and recycled materials used in electrified vehicles including hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) and FCEVs, we are collaborating with partner companies to establish a framework for collecting and recycling HEV batteries and motor magnets, along with tungsten carbide tools used in production. The ultimate goal of this project is to achieve closed-loop recycling. In order to make more effective use of limited resources, we are working on car manufacturing that takes recycling into consideration, by providing results of these activities into the development and design stages.

It is critical for humans to conserve forests and other natural environments in all regions for coexistence in harmony with nature. However, deforestation, fragmentation of habitats for various wildlife and loss of biodiversity are increasing across the world. These developments entail a range of issues including depletion of biological resources that are essential to society, causing natural disasters and driving global warming, and we believe that they pose risks to the sustainability of the entire society. In light of these risks, in order to “enrich the lives of communities” in each region, Toyota launched programs promoting harmony with nature in Japan and overseas and is taking action to expand “Connecting Communities” activities under the Toyota Green Wave Project, and is “Connecting with the World” by promoting activities for achieving harmony with nature and preserving biodiversity globally under the Toyota Today for Tomorrow Project in cooperation with international organizations and NGOs. In addition, we conduct environmental educational programs for employees, future generations and others and carry out “Connecting to the Future” measures under the Toyota ESD1 Project. Through these three “connecting” programs, we are working to create a future where people and nature can exist in harmony and will contribute to achieving Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 12.8 (sustainable lifestyles), 15.1 (conservation of terrestrial ecosystems), and 15.a (ensuring financial resources).
● Implemented wildlife habitat maintenance and improvement measures at the Tsutsumi, Teiho and other plants and conducted indicator species surveys to confirm the effects ● Implemented activities promoting harmony with nature such as creating forests at plant sites and conserving biodiversity in collaboration with Toyota Group companies and other affiliated companies ● Completed assessment of 21,341 species for the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List, held a side event at the CMS COP132 and donated vehicles to conduct surveys and conservation activities in countries such as Myanmar, Tahiti and Guyana ● Supported 26 projects of NPOs and other non-profit organizations and groups addressing biodiversity and climate change (11 overseas and 15 in Japan) ● Implement globally unified initiatives to foster environmentally conscious persons responsible for the future ◆ Offer environmental education opportunities by utilizing biotopes and others in collaboration with “Plant in Harmony with Nature” ◆ Foster environmentally conscious persons at both in-house and outside sites, including plants and the Forest of Toyota, by utilizing educational tools in harmony with nature for the next generation.

Toyota Technical Center Shimoyama in the overlapping area of Toyota City and Okazaki City, conserves about 60 percent of the total project site as areas for environmental conservation based on the concept of “technical center in harmony with nature and local communities.” Five species of animals and plants (oriental honey-buzzard, grey-faced buzzard, Japanese night heron, Japanese eight-barbel loach and Japanese bellflower) representative of the project site’s satoyama ecosystems were selected as indicator species, and we are regenerating and managing forests and valley bottom rice fields in collaboration with local government and the local community. We actively share the status of these activities and new findings gained from them.
Collaborates with IUCN, WWF and Other Organizations to Conserve Biodiversity. 
We began a five-year partnership with the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in 2016. Under the partnership, we provide annual grants of approximately 1.2 million U.S. dollars. We are the first private-sector company providing this scale of support to the IUCN to enhance the IUCN Red List1, a global indicator of wildlife species. With this support, IUCN will conduct assessments of extinction risk for 28,000 species, accounting for 35 percent of the 80,000 additional species needed on the IUCN Red List to inform global decision making for the United Nations’ Convention on Biological Diversity. The IUCN Red List plays important roles including serving as a source of globally trusted and comprehensive data on the status of conservation of animals, fungi and plants on a global scale to support implementation of the United Nations 2030 Agenda. Toyota is also the first car company and the first Japanese company to sign a five-year Global Corporate Partnership agreement with the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). We have made one million U.S. dollar annual grants since 2016 to support the Living Asian Forest Project, to conserve tropical forests and wildlife in Southeast Asia and make the production of important commodities such as natural rubber more sustainable.
