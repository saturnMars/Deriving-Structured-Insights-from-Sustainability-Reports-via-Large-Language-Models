Letter from Our CEO. 
As a global technology leader, Broadcom delivers products and solutions connecting everything in our lives. Our technologies are included in missioncritical solutions that our customers and their customers depend on and can have a positive impact on our communities.
Our second Environmental, Social & Governance (ESG) Report reflects the feedback we received from our diverse stakeholders and the steps we have taken in 2021 on our ESG journey.
I am proud of our talented workforce who have continued to show their dedication and resilience and have allowed us to continue to provide our cuttingedge products and technologies to our customers during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to taking many proactive measures to keep our workforce safe in 2021, we have focused on strengthening our welcoming and inclusive workplace culture because our workforce is the foundation of our success.
We also recognize our responsibility to reduce our impact on the environment in our operations and with our products. Through our holistic and innovative design and development process, we are continuing to meet the increased demand for high performance and more energy efficient products. In 2022, we plan to launch our first switch co-packaged optics solution to help data center operators reduce their power consumption.
Moreover, as the world moves away from fossil fuels and towards green energy systems, such as wind turbines and solar energy systems, our industrial products are able to support these green energy systems and make them more efficient and robust.
We remain committed to conducting our business with integrity, strong corporate governance, respecting human rights and responsibly sourcing materials throughout our global supply chain. As a member of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA), Broadcom supports the RBA’s vision of a global electronics industry that creates sustainable value for workers, the environment and business.
We have embarked on our ESG journey, and we strive to support the communities in which we work and live while also delivering innovative, best-inclass products to our customers. We look forward to sharing our progress in the coming years.

Our ESG Priorities. 
Our ESG priority assessment from 2020 and stakeholder engagement in 2020 and 2021 helped us to understand the ESG issues that are most significant to Broadcom and our stakeholders and guided us in the development of our 2021 corporate social responsibility program and initiatives.
As part of this assessment, we considered a wide range of inputs to identify focus areas, risks and opportunities for Broadcom, including: • Leading global reporting guidelines, such as the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on ClimateRelated Financial Disclosures (TCFD) • Market trends and standards in the semiconductor and software industries, including focus areas set forth by the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) • Perspectives and feedback from our stockholders and customers on their ESG priorities • Engagement with key internal stakeholders, including our employees, senior leadership and internal subject matter experts, to identify and prioritize the ESG issues with the most significant potential impact on our business. 
Our ESG priorities, which were validated by our ESG Steering Committee and reviewed by our NESG Committee and Board, are the ones we deem most relevant to our stakeholders and to our ability to create long-term value.
We aim to continue to periodically refresh our ESG priority assessment.

Helping Customers with Sustainability. 
Reduce Data Center Power Consumption. 
Currently, data centers account for 1% of global power consumption. By 2030, that number is expected to increase to as much as 13%. Networking in data centers accounts for approximately 9% of a data center’s power consumption and we expect this to continue to grow in the coming years.
In early 2021, we unveiled our product roadmap for co-packaged optics (CPO) solutions, which include the transceiver CPO, switch CPO and AI/ML CPO, aimed at addressing next generation bandwidth and power challenges. Our purpose-built switch CPO platform combines Broadcom’s leading-edge switch silicon and optics on the same package substrate to deliver the industry’s highest power efficiency. Having the switch directly driving the optics significantly reduces the interconnect power and thereby increases the system power handling capability. Compared to conventional discrete solutions, these switch CPO solutions are expected to deliver 30% power consumption savings while providing 40% lower optics costs per bit.
Broadcom is best positioned to lead CPO product development and help data center operators reduce their power consumption.
For more information, see our Co-Packaged Optics (CPO).
Enable Green Energy Systems. 
As the world moves toward green energy systems and away from fossil fuels, Broadcom’s industrial products continue to help support these green energy systems.
Broadcom optocouplers are used in an array of green applications ranging from solar and wind inverters, energy storage, automotive electric vehicles, and charging and power supplies.
The popularity of Broadcom optocouplers in these green applications is due to their ability to drive inverters more efficiently, to reduce copper losses by providing high insulation voltage and to consume less power during current sensing and data transmission.
For example, Broadcom’s isolated gate drive and optocoupler products are used in renewable energy storage systems that store electricity when the demand is low and supply stored electricity when the demand is high. This improves the energy efficiency of the power generation system and stabilizes operation of the electricity grid – both at a utility scale and a home scale.
For more information, see our Optocouplers and Opto-Isolators and Industrial Fiber Optics.
12 BROADCOM 2021 ESG REPORT


Quality and Reliability. 
Our reputation for product excellence is built upon the innovation, quality and reliability of our products. We continue to achieve this by: • Clearly understanding customer needs and providing products that meet those needs • Integrating quality management principles into critical business processes and decision- making practices • Continuously improving the effectiveness of our quality management system, processes and products, to enhance their value for our customers • Establishing strict quality standards and requiring suppliers, partners and contractors to comply with them • Maintaining our quality management system to manage product life cycle processes and procedures in conformance with the requirements of International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 9001 • Complying with the relevant regulatory requirements, including RoHS, REACH and regulations related to Conflict Minerals. 
Our Chief Operations Officer reviews quality issues, including customer returns, every month. We expect our employees to provide products that meet legal requirements and are safe for their intended markets and applications, as outlined by our Broadcom Product Safety and Regulations Policy.
Elimination of Hazardous Materials from Products. 
The elimination of hazardous materials from products is a global initiative, with each region or country imposing its own legislation to eliminate these harmful substances from the environment. For more information on Broadcom’s efforts, please refer to our Product Material Environmental Specifications and General Specification for the Environment (GSE).
Broadcom offers a broad portfolio of RoHS-compliant products. Rigorous testing procedures ensure the performance integrity of Broadcom’s portfolio of products, regardless of the materials and processes employed.
ISO Certification. 
Our quality management system and processes are aligned with the requirements of ISO 9001, and we choose suppliers with quality management systems of equal rigor. We expect our suppliers and partners to comply with our Suppliers & Partners Quality System Requirements. Certain of our sites are ISO 9001 certified. For more information, please refer to our certificates: ISO 9001 Certificate and International Automotive Task Force (IATF) 16949 Certificate.

Workforce 14 BROADCOM 2021 ESG REPORT


At Broadcom, we understand that our workforce is the foundation of our success. Having a talented, engaged and diverse workforce makes us a strong, resilient and innovative company. We are able to recruit and retain our highly skilled and dedicated workforce due to our workplace culture, which encourages our employees to push for excellence and innovation, and rewards and supports them for giving their best.
Employee Engagement. 
Having highly engaged employees is a key component to Broadcom’s success. We measure our employees’ engagement by our voluntary attrition rate and our Employee Ethical Culture Survey. Our voluntary attrition rate and responses to our Employee Ethical Culture Survey help us to continue to improve and create an environment that is supportive of our employees and where our employees feel their contributions are valued.
In 2021, we were recognized as one of Forbes’ World’s Best Employers and America’s Best Employers for Diversity.
Supporting Fair Labor and Human Rights. 
Broadcom’s employment practices and policies support the fundamental human rights principles of freely chosen employment, non-discrimination, the elimination of forced and underage labor and the rights of workers to organize and freely associate, as articulated in the International Labour Organization Conventions.
Our employees are aware of their rights. We currently have a number of employees under collective bargaining agreements in various countries.
As part of our commitment to human rights, we conduct an annual internal human rights assessment and have found no human rights concerns.
15 BROADCOM 2021 ESG REPORT 6.8%
VOLUNTARY ATTRITION RATE IN 2021. 
Our global voluntary attrition rate in 2021, which does not include employees who left as a result of restructuring, divestitures or terminations for cause, was 6.8%, which is below the technology industry benchmark (AON, 2021 Salary Increase and Turnover Study — Second Edition, September 2021).


Workforce Snapshot. 
At the end of 2021, Broadcom had approximately 20,000 employees in 29 countries around the world. Our EEO-1 report for our employees in the U.S. can be found at the Corporate Citizenship webpage on our external company website.

M&A Integration. 
We are proud that many knowledgeable and talented employees from our acquired companies and businesses, such as LSI, Brocade, CA and Symantec Enterprise Security, have decided to join us. It is not always easy to successfully integrate upon closing an acquisition, and we do not take this challenge lightly. We take a thoughtful approach when integrating our acquired companies and businesses and workforces.
Leaders from the acquired companies and businesses who join us help to ensure that employee morale is maintained and attrition is limited. Currently, in addition to Kirsten Spears, our Chief Financial Officer, and Charlie Kawwas, our Chief Operating Officer, over 40% of our executives and general managers who lead business units within Broadcom have joined us through acquisitions.
Our CEO, executives and many different groups, such as Human Resources, Finance, Legal, Global Technology Organization, Global Operations and Workplace Services, are actively involved in planning integration and ensuring a supportive integration upon closing the acquisition. We provide the employees who have decided to join us with orientation, compliance and product trainings, and onboarding and transition assistance so that they can quickly integrate into Broadcom and be part of the Broadcom team from “day one” of closing the acquisition.
Our Broadcom Software Group, under the leadership of Tom Krause who was previously our Chief Financial Officer and is now the President of this group, is the product of our commitment to integration planning and is an example of how our employees from our acquired companies and businesses are engaged and working together to build one of the world’s leading enterprise software businesses within Broadcom.
17 BROADCOM 2021 ESG REPORT. 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. 
Broadcom is a multi-national, multi-cultural company that employs people of many different nationalities, ethnicities, cultures, abilities, backgrounds, faiths and beliefs. Our goal is to create a welcoming and inclusive culture, which empowers our workforce to give their best, collaborate and contribute to our collective success.
Diversity@Broadcom. 
In 2021, we launched the Diversity@Broadcom initiative to encourage a diverse, equitable and inclusive community at Broadcom.
Our Senior Vice President and General Manager of our Optical Systems Division and our Vice President and General Manager of our PreAmp Components Division were the executive sponsors of the Diversity@ Broadcom initiative. The Diversity@Broadcom initiative is also supported by a steering committee at Broadcom that is comprised of several of our executives and general managers who report to our CEO and lead business units at Broadcom.
Through the Diversity@Broadcom initiative, we commenced a quarterly global Leadership Talk series featuring Broadcom executives and other industry leaders. The purpose of the Leadership Talk series is to provide a forum for leaders and our employees to share their experiences and discuss leadership, diversity, equity and inclusion within our industry.
We also established through the Diversity@Broadcom initiative Lean In Circles within Broadcom. The Lean In Circles provide our employees with peer mentorship and a safe space where they can share their experiences, build new skills and lead. We have approximately a dozen Lean In Circles, including LGBT at Broadcom, Neurodiversity at Work: ASD Allies, Tech Moms Driving Career Growth and Women in Mainframe IT. We are excited to support this important community network for our employees and look forward to the program growing over the coming years.


Hiring. 
We strive to recruit and hire diverse candidates and advance qualified women, minorities, veterans and individuals with disabilities. We are increasing our efforts to recruit and retain candidates from underrepresented communities, including recruiting on websites focused on diverse backgrounds and experiences.
In 2021, we required our managers to take unconscious bias training to encourage awareness of unconscious bias in recruiting and hiring. In addition, we regularly monitor our various programs and policies related to employment decisions and equal opportunity and we annually assess our affirmative action programs and policies to identify and address areas of potential improvement.
STEM Pipeline. 
It is important to Broadcom that we improve the representation of women and underrepresented communities in technical roles in our pipeline of candidates.
We partner with the Broadcom Foundation, a non-profit organization funded from our subsidiary Broadcom Corporation, to advance science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) education for women and underrepresented youth. Broadcom believes that cultivating interest in STEM, providing equitable access to STEM education and preparing students to be college and career-ready to succeed in STEM fields is key to creating the engineers, scientists and innovators of tomorrow who will ultimately fill our pipeline of candidates.
With annual grants of over $4 million, the Broadcom Foundation has supported regional, national and international science fairs, coding programs and competitions and after/out-of-school programs for pre-college students. Our employees also volunteer their time to mentor, participate in STEM education programs and judge competitions.
Scholarships. 
At the end of 2021, approximately 64% of our employees worldwide were in research and development (R&D) roles.
Broadcom is committed to improving the pipeline of women and underrepresented communities in these technical roles, particularly in the field of engineering.
In 2021, we provided scholarships focused toward electrical engineering and computer science students from underrepresented communities at San Jose State University and Colorado State University, both of which are located near several of our larger facilities in the U.S. In addition, we sponsored scholarships with the Society of Women Engineers.
18 BROADCOM 2021 ESG REPORT


Compensation and Benefits. 
Compensation. 
Broadcom’s success depends on the continued ability to attract, motivate and retain our workforce. Competition for talented employees is significant in many locations where we operate, such as Silicon Valley and Southeast Asia.
As a result, we provide competitive compensation and benefit programs to our employees, including performance-based compensation (such as our annual cash bonus program, sales incentive plans and spot bonuses) and equity awards.
Broadcom is different from its peer companies because a vast majority of our employees receive equity awards that vest over time. We grant equity to our employees because we want our employees to share in Broadcom’s success.
We believe that equity compensation aligns the interest of our employees with our stockholders, is a key factor in recruiting and retaining top talent and assists in the successful and rapid integration of our employees who join Broadcom through acquisitions.
Nurse Triage 24 Hour Program. 
In 2021, we provided Nurse Triage 24 Hour (NT24) to our U.S. employees. NT24 is a hotline that is staffed 24 hours a day and 365 days out of the year by highly-trained registered nurses.
NT24 gives our U.S. employees access to immediate medical guidance for non-emergency work-related injuries or illnesses. NT24’s registered nurses help determine the level of care required, and our U.S. employees are guided through self-care or referred to a medical provider if treatment beyond self-care is needed.
Pay Equity. 
As part of our effort to ensure employee equality and pay equity, in 2021 we engaged a third-party firm to conduct a pay equity evaluation focusing on subsets of our global population, including the U.S.
After accounting for factors such as job and location, this evaluation revealed that, on average, pay was equitable for employees in the same job doing the same work when comparing women to men globally, or when comparing Asian, Black/African American, or Hispanic/Latinx to White/Caucasian employees in the U.S.
19 BROADCOM 2021 ESG REPORT


Benefits, Health and Well-Being. 
The health and well-being of our employees is important to Broadcom.
In 2021, we were able to return to the office and maintain on-site operations during COVID-19 because we took numerous additional proactive measures to protect and invest in the health and well-being of our employees. We proactively consulted with third-party certified industrial hygienists and epidemiologists in adopting additional protective measures on top of complying with government mandated safety protocols and industry standards. Please see the Health and Safety During COVID-19 section for more information about our COVID-19 safety actions.
We offer a range of benefits to our employees beyond the traditional healthcare benefits and insurance. Our U.S. benefits include: • Employee Assistance Programs (EAP), including mental health services • Paid parental leave • Adoption assistance • Increased sick-leave flexibility in response to COVID-19 • Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) • Retirement planning • Education Assistance Program • Nurse Triage 24 Hour (NT24) support. 
To help reduce stress and encourage mindfulness, we provide wellness and prayer/meditation rooms. We also subsidize our on-site cafeterias that feature healthy dietary options, including vegetarian and halal options where available.
20 BROADCOM 2021 ESG REPORT


Development and Feedback. 
Training. 
We encourage our employees to strengthen their skills and keep them up to date.
We provide structured, job-specific technical training and testing for our manufacturing and operational employees. We also provide numerous technical product trainings to our sales personnel.
Each business unit has the ability to establish its own training and development programs, including intern and mentorship programs. For example, employees in our Agile Operations Division (AOD) have the opportunity to participate in knowledge sharing events, mentoring programs and a variety of learning communities. In addition, AOD invests in our current and future leaders through an extensive leadership program — Unleashing Your Leadership Potential — that provides them with the tools and experience to drive real business results.
Throughout the year, all of our employees (including part-time employees) and contractors are required to complete trainings that support Broadcom’s values and culture, such as our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, harassment prevention, anti-corruption, protection of confidential information, data privacy and security, unconscious bias, human rights, anti-competition prevention and export compliance trainings.
170,000+
ASSIGNED LEARNING HOURS IN 2021. 
In 2021, our employees and contractors completed a total of over 170,000 assigned learning hours, including over 30,000 assigned learning hours of technical training.
Feedback. 
Our managers have multiple opportunities throughout the year to provide performance feedback to their team members, including feedback on career and skill development. Our review and decisions on annual salary, bonuses, equity award grants and promotions occur in different quarters throughout the year, and at each of those times managers are required to evaluate their team members’ performance and provide them feedback.
Educational Assistance Program. 
Our Educational Assistance program is available to all employees (including part-time employees) and provides them with financial assistance to take academic classes or relevant degree programs that are work-related and provide knowledge and skills to enhance their job performance.
During 2021, we reimbursed employees a total of over $430,000 in tuition expenses under this program.
21 BROADCOM 2021 ESG REPORT


Employee Health and Safety. 
Maintaining a safe and healthy work environment is important for the well-being and productivity of our employees.
We continue to make strides in engaging our employees to design and implement safe work processes that eliminate hazards and reduce occupational health and safety (OHS) risks in our operations.
EHS Management System. 
Our Employee Health and Safety (EHS) management system and processes apply to all of our facilities globally, and we maintain third party ISO 14001 certification at certain sites. To drive EHS compliance across Broadcom facilities, we assign site coordinators and develop and implement site-specific EHS Compliance Plans that consider local OHS risks in our operations, the environment and legal requirements. EHS Compliance Plan implementation is tracked and regularly reported to senior management.
In 2021, we updated our Occupational Health & Safety Policy to better align with international and Singapore OHS management system standards (ISO 45001:2018 and SS 651:2019).
Communication and Training. 
Our EHS intranet site provides information to our employees, including COVID-19 pandemic information, emergency action plans, workrelated injury reporting systems, EHS Compliance Plans and other EHS programs, procedures and guidelines.
We also provide self-paced online EHS training courses to help our employees understand their responsibilities and the resources available to them.

Health and Safety Performance. 
In 2021, we implemented processes for reporting occupational injuries and illnesses so global rates could be more consistently managed and tracked. Once reported, we conduct an incident investigation and root cause analysis, as needed, to determine appropriate corrective and preventive actions.
Our semiconductor manufacturing and laboratory operations represent our most significant health and safety risks, due to higher potential exposure to chemicals and machinery-related hazards at such sites.
Continued focus on managing and reducing these risks has helped us maintain U.S. occupational injury and illness lost-time case rates significantly below the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) occupational injury and illness incidence rate averages for the semiconductors, computer system design and software publishers industries in which we operate over the last five years.
In 2021, we had 22 recordable cases and 11 lost workday cases representing a total of 347 lost workdays globally.
In 2021, our global total injury and illness case rate was 0.11 cases per 100 employees, and our lost workday case rate was 0.05 cases per 100 employees. There were no work-related fatalities globally in 2021.
On-site Health Clinic. 
Since March 2018, our Fort Collins manufacturing facility has partnered with UCHealth to provide our employees with access to medical care through an on-site health clinic.
The clinic is open during hours that overlap all employee shifts and is staffed by a Physician Assistant and a Medical Assistant, who can provide both personal primary care and occupational surveillance and treatment. Since September 2020, the clinic has had almost 2,500 visits, involving a range of services such as workers compensation injury/illness evaluation, treatment and medical surveillance, such as audiograms, pulmonary function testing, respirator clearance and mask fitting.
The clinic also provides personal primary care such as immunizations, blood draws, rapid diagnostic testing and drop-in vital sign measurements.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the onsite clinician has been an active participant of Broadcom’s COVID-19 mitigation team to help maintain a healthy workplace and enable continuous facility operations by communicating with each employee who reported COVID-19 symptoms or exposure, giving them testing and treatment guidance and clearing them to return to work per Broadcom’s COVID-19 Mitigation Policy guidelines.

Supply Chain 25 BROADCOM 2021 ESG REPORT


We are committed to supporting ethical business conduct, respecting human rights and responsibly sourcing materials throughout our global supply chain. We outsource most of our manufacturing and strive to work with responsible supply chain partners that are leaders in the industry.
Supply Chain Management. 
Our Supplier Environmental and Social Responsibility Code of Conduct (Supplier Code), which we updated in 2021 to reflect the RBA Code of Conduct, is the foundation of our responsible sourcing practices. Our Supplier Code establishes our expectations regarding workplace standards and business practices for our suppliers—including with respect to labor and human rights, health and safety, the environment and anti-corruption.
In addition to our Supplier Code, our Conflict Minerals Policy, supplier onboarding procedures and contract and purchase order terms establish the standards and expectations for our suppliers regarding human rights and other ESG-related issues.
We comply with the U.S. federal government’s requirements for government contractors, as set forth in our internal Broadcom Combating Trafficking in Persons Compliance Plan.
We also publish an annual Statement Against Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking, in compliance with the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act, the U.K. Modern Slavery Act and the Australian Modern Slavery Act.
Supplier Audits. 
In addition to the supplier human rights survey, our Global Operations and Internal Audit teams regularly audit our suppliers to evaluate their operations and compliance with various Broadcom and human rightsrelated requirements, including compliance with wage and hour labor laws, safe and respectful working conditions, written employment agreements and prohibitions on charging workers recruitment fees. While these audits are typically on-site audits at the supplier location, we adjusted and primarily conducted our audits remotely in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Supplier Diversity. 
We seek to source goods and services from minority-owned, woman-owned, historically underutilized businesses, veteran-owned, service-disabled veteran-owned, small and disadvantaged businesses that are able to provide quality goods and services in a timely and competitive manner. We also include women- and minority-owned firms in our corporate debt financing syndicates.
In 2021, Broadcom became a member of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA).
We are committed to upholding RBA’s vision of a global electronics industry that creates sustainable value for workers, the environment and business.
As a member of RBA, we have applied some elements of RBA’s tools in our supplier audits.
26 BROADCOM 2021 ESG REPORT


2021 Supplier Engagement. 
Although we primarily outsource our manufacturing, we regularly engage with our suppliers and we are working to improve our multi-tier supply chain visibility.
In 2021, we undertook several initiatives to strengthen our human rights program within our supply chain, including: • Becoming a member of RBA • Updating our Supplier Code to reflect the RBA Code of Conduct and translating our Supplier Code into Chinese • Updating our supplier onboarding process to increase screening for human rights-related matters • Expanding our supplier monitoring program to screen for human rights issues, which includes over 90% of our current supply chain suppliers (based on our 2020 supplier spend) • Sending our first annual supplier expectations communication to reinforce our commitment to a responsible supply chain and provide suppliers with information on our supply chain human rights program, including our updated Supplier Code and access to training • Conducting an expanded human rights survey of our supply chain suppliers • Remediating human rights concerns raised in our 2020 supplier human rights survey—specifically four suppliers who used fines to discipline workers and one supplier who did not permit collective bargaining no longer engage in these prohibited practices • Offering human rights and forced labor prevention training to our suppliers • Providing human rights and forced labor prevention training to our employees • Requiring our larger manufacturing suppliers to certify adherence to our Supplier Code on an annual basis. 
Annual Supplier Survey. 
In 2021, we conducted our second annual survey of our significant suppliers for human rights-related issues. We achieved a 100% survey response rate from our second annual survey.
We identified and surveyed our largest suppliers globally (based on 2020 supplier spend data) that were not part of our 2020 supplier human rights survey. These suppliers, collectively with the suppliers surveyed in 2020, represent over 90% of our supply chain (based on our 2020 supplier spend).
We found no instances of forced labor, child labor, slavery or human trafficking among Broadcom’s suppliers. However, we identified one supplier, who is located in Europe, who may use fines as a method of discipline for its workers. While this practice is legal in the jurisdiction and the supplier has a well-defined written escalating disciplinary process supported by the local trade union, we have actively engaged with this supplier and requested that it discontinues this practice.
27 BROADCOM 2021 ESG REPORT


Preventing Forced Labor Training. 
In 2021, as part of our ongoing efforts to educate and raise awareness of forced labor and human trafficking issues, we required human rights awareness and forced labor prevention training for relevant employees in our Global Operations, HR, Legal, Procurement and supply chain functions who have a direct responsibility for supply chain management. Our employees working with our U.S. government customers participate in combating trafficking in persons training and prevention of forced labor training on an annual basis. We achieved a 100% completion rate for both of these trainings in 2021.
Responsible Minerals Sourcing. 
We are committed to socially responsible sourcing of conflict minerals (cassiterite, columbite-tantalite, gold, wolframite, and/or their derivatives tin, tantalum and tungsten) included in our products.
We are a member of the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI), and leverage RMI’s resources to conduct our conflict minerals supply chain due diligence, including using RMI’s database of suppliers that are listed on the Responsible Minerals Assurance Process (RMAP) Conformant Smelter List. We strongly support our industry’s efforts to expand the smelter certification program and the audit process.
We continued our annual due diligence of our supply chain for the use of conflict minerals in the design and manufacturing of our products in conjunction with our annual SEC reporting. Due to the nature of our supply chain where we outsource most of our manufacturing, we do not typically have a direct relationship with the smelters and refiners (SORs).
In 2020, 95% (245 out of 259) of the active SORs potentially in our supply chain were certified “conflict free” under the RMAP audit process. This high level of conformance is due to our on-going efforts to identify conflict minerals risks in our supply chain and encourage our suppliers to purchase materials only from SORs that are certified as “conflict free” in compliance with RMAP protocols. For more information, see our Conflict Minerals Policy and our 2020 Conflict Minerals Report.
COVID-19 and Supply Challenges. 
As the COVID-19 pandemic continued in 2021, we experienced some disruption in our supply chain when facilities of our key suppliers and service providers were impacted or operated with limited resources and workers. In response, we worked closely with our supply chain to safeguard their workers’ health and ensure continued supply of products and services.
As we enter into 2022, we are also facing supply challenges. Similar to the way we responded to COVID-19, we will continue to monitor and engage our supply chain to ensure human rights are protected while focusing on business continuity.

Global Energy and Emissions. 
We actively monitor and collect data on the electricity and fuel we consume in our facilities, as well as process gases including perfluorocarbon (PFC) used in tooling, which are the primary drivers of our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions.
For this report, we calculated GHG emissions associated with our electricity, natural gas, fuel, refrigerant, PFC and process gas consumption/loss for both office and manufacturing facilities globally. PFCs and process gases are required for certain tools in the semiconductor manufacturing process, including CVD chamber cleaning and etching equipment. Semiconductor manufacturing processes also use fluorinated compounds including perfluorocarbons, hydrofluorocarbons, nitrogen trifluoride and sulfur hexafluoride as well as fluorinated heat transfer fluids and nitrous oxide.
Electricity usage at our facilities accounts for approximately 71% of our total energy consumption and approximately 56% of our overall Scope 1 and 2 (location-based) GHG emissions. Our second largest source of GHG emissions are PFCs and process gases, which are used in processing equipment at our manufacturing facilities, and account for approximately 34% of our overall Scope 1 and 2 (location-based) GHG emissions.
For U.S. facilities, we reduced total energy consumption by 7.3% and total Scope 1 and Scope 2 (location-based) emissions by 3.6% in 2021 compared to 2020.
Projects to Save Energy and Reduce Emissions. 
To drive operational improvement, we routinely review the efficiency of our equipment, technologies, and processes, and look for ways to reduce our energy consumption and emissions. We have many on-going long-term efficiency improvement and emission reduction projects throughout our global facilities.
During 2021, we implemented several energy saving and emissions reduction projects at our facilities globally, including: • Our Hyderabad, India office installed a variable frequency drive (VFD) control panel for one of their buildings in July 2021. VFDs are used to control the speed of alternating current (AC) motors by varying the frequency supplied to the motor, therefore limiting the amount of electricity usage in the building. This project is estimated to save up to 120,000 kWh of electricity or reduce emissions by 90 tCO2e annually.
• Our Penang, Malaysia office expects to save roughly 66,000 kWh of energy per year and reduce emissions by 44 tCO2e from the replacement of several units of florescent lamps with LEDs and through the installation of an inverter control for the building’s chiller.
• Our Beijing, China office installed occupancy sensors for public area lighting, an initiative that saves up to 8,400 kWh of electricity and reduces emissions by 5 tCO2e per year.
• Our Breinigsville, Pennsylvania manufacturing facility is converting ten pumps from wet to dry, a transition that saves 50,000 kWh of energy annually, reduces emissions by 16 tCO2e per year and reduces the consumption of hydrocarbon and Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) based oils by 95%.
37 BROADCOM 2021 ESG REPORT


Environmental Metrics. 
For all environmental metrics, we apply an operational control boundary. We used the methodology outlined in the World Resource Institute (WRI) and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development’s (WBCSD) GHG Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Revised Edition) and WRI/ WBSCD GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance – an amendment to the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard to calculate Scope 1 and 2 emissions generated by our global facilities.
Through this assessment, we measured the GHG emissions associated with natural gas, diesel fuels, kerosene and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) we utilize for heating and cooling our facilities and for our backup generators, as well as the refrigerants and PFCs used in our manufacturing, offices and equipment over which we have operational control. In addition, we measured the electricity we purchase to power our facilities (Scope 2 location-based method). GHG emissions are reported in metric tonnes of CO2e (tCO2e). Our energy consumption is limited to natural gas, diesel, kerosene, LPG and electricity use. We calculate energy and emissions based on actual data when available. When actual consumption data is not available, we estimate utilizing square footage intensity factors by facility type.
The following tables summarize our fuel and energy consumption and our GHG emissions for global facilities in 2021, as well as for facilities in the U.S. for both 2020 and 2021.

Water Management. 
We recognize that water scarcity and quality are challenges that many communities encounter around the world, and we strive to use water responsibly in our operations.
Semiconductor manufacturing uses a significant amount of water. We operate a primarily outsourced manufacturing model, with over 85% of our wafer manufacturing performed by thirdparty foundries. We also outsource the substantial majority of our assembly and test operations to third parties. Our contract manufacturers and other suppliers are expected to abide by our Supplier Code. In 2021, we calculated water withdrawals associated with our global offices and manufacturing facilities.
We regularly monitor our own water use at facilities where we have operational control and make efforts to conserve and use it efficiently in our facilities. Water is monitored and managed locally, and we have implemented various technologies to reduce water consumption. At facilities in the U.S., these efforts resulted in water reduction of over 8%, or nearly 44 million gallons, in 2021 compared to 2020.
In the U.S., our Fort Collins manufacturing facility is the primary driver of our water consumption. We actively monitor our water consumption and evaluate our water efficiency efforts at this manufacturing facility. We have invested, and continue to invest, in substantial improvements to conserve, recycle and reclaim water used at our Fort Collins manufacturing facility, including the installation in 2021 of a water reuse system that is expected to save an additional 18 million gallons of water each year.
Outside of the U.S., our Singapore manufacturing facility is the largest user of water. This location is ISO 14001 certified and has implemented a number of initiatives to drive efficiency across the facility.

Recycling E-Waste. 
Currently, we partner with a third-party service provider to decommission and recycle all of our U.S. e-waste, as required by local regulations. In 2021, we recycled nearly 86 metric tons (190,000 lbs) of e-waste from our owned facilities globally.
To celebrate Earth Day in 2021, Broadcom sponsored an employee e-waste recycling initiative at some of our largest U.S. sites. Approximately 11 metric tons (over 24,250 lbs) of e-waste were collected.
Small Changes with Big Impact. 
To promote environmental sustainability, our Global Operations team set an ambitious goal of reusing or recycling 30% of the packing materials used at our warehouse in Malaysia. Since the beginning of this project in May 2020, we have been able to reuse over 102,000 cardboard boxes, saving approximately 2,100 trees. This initiative not only helps reduce our environmental impact but has also saved us approximately $130,000 per year in operating expenses.

Governance 41 BROADCOM 2021 ESG REPORT


We are committed to conducting business with integrity and maintaining the highest standards of business conduct and ethics. Our corporate governance framework is designed for accountability of our Board and management and transparency to our employees, stockholders and other stakeholders.
Board Governance. 
Our Board is led by Chairman Henry Samueli, Ph.D. and Lead Independent Director Eddy Hartenstein. Broadcom’s Board is comprised of nine members. Seven of our nine directors are deemed to be independent. Three of our directors are women, and four of our directors are considered to be underrepresented minorities (pursuant to the Nasdaq Stock Market’s listing standards).
Our Board has four standing committees: Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, Nominating, Environmental, Social and Governance Committee and Executive Committee.
Recognizing the increased importance of corporate social responsibility and sustainability for Broadcom’s continued business success, our Board changed the name of the “Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee” to the “Nominating, Environmental, Social and Governance Committee” (NESG Committee) in February 2021.
Our Board has adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines that cover various topics relating to the Board and its responsibilities, such as composition, overboarding, succession, performance evaluations and operations.
One of the Board’s responsibilities is evaluating Broadcom’s business risks, including climate-related risks and opportunities and cybersecurity risks, and enterprise risk management practices. Our senior management team regularly reviews and discusses with the Board these risks and enterprise risk management, the measures in place to address these risks and the effectiveness of those measures.

Ethics and Integrity. 
The foundation of our corporate governance framework is our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct (the Code) and Anti-Bribery and AntiCorruption Policy. It is important to Broadcom that our employees, officers, directors and contractors understand and comply with our Code and Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy.
Code of Ethics and Business Conduct. 
Our Code guides our employees, officers, directors and contractors in how we conduct our business and work with each other. Our Code reflects our values, standards and expectations. Complying with the Code is a condition of continued employment or engagement with Broadcom. We require our employees to annually certify that they have read and understand the Code. Our Code is translated into the following local languages: Chinese, French, German, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian and Spanish.
Our Chief Legal and Corporate Affairs Officer, who is our Compliance Officer, actively monitors and audits compliance with the Code under the direction and oversight of the Audit Committee. Internal Audit, with our Chief Legal and Corporate Affairs Officer, reports to the Audit Committee at each quarterly meeting alleged violations of the Code and actions taken under the Code.
Employee Engagement on Compliance Culture. 
In 2021, we launched our Global Compliance Ambassador program to strengthen our compliance culture. Our leaders from Legal and Finance at our local global offices were chosen to be our compliance ambassadors to represent our Compliance Team at those offices. Our Compliance Team has standing meetings with our compliance ambassadors, partners with them in reviewing trainings and updates them when there are new developments in local law or publiclydisclosed real-life cases that would be helpful to them and our employees to understand our compliance culture and policies.
Our Compliance Team also contributes to Broadcom’s quarterly newsletter that is sent to all employees globally. Through the newsletter, our Compliance Team updates our employees on upcoming trainings and encourages them to speak-up if they see questionable behavior or possible misconduct.
Our Compliance Team developed a compliance “toolkit” for our managers because they are responsible for overseeing compliance of our policies by the personnel they manage. The “toolkit” provides additional support and information to managers, including useful links to our policies and resources like compliance videos and slides, as well as information on how to encourage a culture of compliance and manage situations when employees report compliance issues to them.
43 BROADCOM 2021 ESG REPORT


Reporting Concerns. 
If our employees become aware of a potential violation of the Code, other Broadcom policies or applicable laws, it is their responsibility to report it to their manager, Human Resources or the Compliance Officer.
We provide a number of avenues to contact our Compliance Team, our Compliance Officer and the Audit Committee to report concerns or potential violations of the Code, other Broadcom policies, human rights or applicable laws, including our hotline that is available in multiple languages and is hosted by an external firm not associated with Broadcom. This external hotline is available via telephone and online, and employees, contractors and any other third party can report concerns anonymously (where permitted by local law). In 2021, we received inquiries on a range of topics such as human resource matters, conflicts of interest concerns and allegations of misconduct.
We take concerns and allegations related to the Code, other Broadcom policies or applicable law seriously. We address them promptly, investigate to the extent necessary and take disciplinary actions as appropriate (which may include senior management discussions, employee communications, process and controls improvements and individual corrective action measures).
The Audit Committee receives information on every allegation submitted via our external hotline, as well as reports and updates on investigations that are in progress or completed.
Employee Ethical Culture Survey. 
In 2021, we conducted our annual Employee Ethical Culture Survey with an external firm to better understand our employees’ engagement in and perception of our compliance culture and to find areas where we can continuously improve our compliance culture. Through this survey, we learned that our employees are aware of our compliance program and have confidence in and trust our management. We again scored above the external firm’s company peer group benchmark in all categories that were surveyed in 2021.
In our 2021 Employee Ethical Culture Survey 96.1%
ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE EFFORTS OF THE COMPLIANCE AND ETHICS FUNCTION 97.6%
BELIEVE THE COMMUNICATION, TRAINING AND SUPPORT IN COMPLIANCE ARE EFFECTIVE 92.4%
BELIEVE THE CONDUCT, VALUES AND COMMUNICATIONS OF SENIOR LEADERS ARE HONEST AND ETHICAL. 
Fostering a Speak-Up Culture. 
We strive to create an environment where employees can speak openly about our business practices, including ESG-related matters, and we encourage our employees to ask questions and raise concerns. We have an Open Door Policy and make it very clear that retaliation for raising a concern in good faith or reporting questionable behavior or possible misconduct in good faith is prohibited.
44 BROADCOM 2021 ESG REPORT


Anti-Corruption. 
We prohibit our directors, officers, employees and anyone acting on our behalf from engaging in corruption and bribery. Our Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy is summarized in our Code, including the rules and procedures for providing or accepting gifts, meals and entertainment. Our Chief Legal and Corporate Affairs Officer oversees our Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy. Similar to the Code, we require our employees to annually certify that they have read and understand the Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy and to complete a refresher training.
Internal Audit, with our Compliance Team, regularly assess our operations for corruption risks, including conducting audits of our distributors and resellers. Our Compliance Team conducts anti-corruption diligence on our new suppliers, distributors and resellers before onboarding them and companies and businesses before we acquire them. In addition, our Compliance Team and Internal Audit work with an external firm to biennially review our anti-bribery and anti-corruption compliance program. The results and recommendations from the biennial review are discussed with the Audit Committee and reported to the Board.
Compliance Trainings. 
We require our employees and contractors to complete annual trainings that support Broadcom’s values and culture, including our Code, harassment prevention, anti-bribery and anticorruption, protection of confidential information, data privacy and security, unconscious bias, human rights, insider trading prevention, anti-competition prevention and export compliance trainings. We also require our employee and contractors to certify that they understand and agree to abide by our Broadcom policies on these topics when they complete their trainings.
Our Compliance Team provides our employees located in certain regions and working in certain business groups with additional customized inperson or video-conference trainings on specific topics such as anti-corruption, anti-competition prevention and conflicts of interest.
In addition, we provide live and online anticorruption and compliance trainings to our partners, distributors and resellers worldwide.
Our Compliance Team evaluates annually the compliance trainings and makes appropriate adjustments based on feedback from our employees to provide the most relevant trainings.
99+%
COMPLETION RATE. 
Over 99% of our employees completed our 2021 compliance trainings.
600+
EMPLOYEES/CONTRACTORS.

ESG Governance 57 BROADCOM 2021 ESG REPORT


TCFD Recommendation Broadcom Disclosure Disclosure Location. 
STRATEGY: Disclose the actual and potential impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organization’s businesses, strategy and financial planning where such information is material a) Describe the climate-related risks and opportunities the organization has identified over the short, medium, and long term b) Describe the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organization’s business, strategy, and financial planning. 
For purposes of climate-related risk and opportunities, Broadcom defines short, medium and long-term time horizons as follows: Short-term: 0-5 years; Medium-term: 5-10 years; Long-term: 10-15 years. 
Climate-Related Risks. 
Broadcom has not identified any inherent climate-related risks with the potential to have a substantive financial or strategic impact on our business in the short, medium or long-term. Potential physical risks in our supply chain are considered and integrated into our Global Operations Business Continuity Plans. In addition, our response to the COVID-19 pandemic has shown our resilience to potential physical risks to our operations, including our employees’ ability to work remotely if needed. Our company risk-factors are described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Climate-Related Opportunities. 
Broadcom has identified areas of climate-related opportunities for our business, including: • Products and Markets - Developing new products, as well as evolving existing products, through research, development and innovation has the potential to increase revenues through higher demand for Broadcom’s products and access to new and emerging markets. Broadcom, through our holistic and innovative design and development process, is continuing to meet the increased requirements for high performance and low power products. For example: • In 2022, we plan to launch our first switch co-packaged optics (CPO) solution, which combines our 25.6 Tb/s. 
Tomahawk 4 switch silicon and optics on the same package substrate, aimed at addressing next generation bandwidth and power challenges. Broadcom’s purpose-built CPO platform delivers the industry’s highest power efficiency - having the switch directly driving the optics significantly reduces the interconnect power and thereby increases the system power handling capability. Compared to conventional discrete solutions, these switch CPO solutions are expected to consume 30% less power while providing 40% lower optics costs per bit.
• As the world moves toward green energy systems and away from fossil fuels, Broadcom’s industrial products continue to help support these green energy systems. Broadcom provides a wide range of industrial fiber optic transceiver, isolated gate driver, isolation amplifier and digital optocoupler products, which are used in wind turbines and solar energy systems. These products support various functions inside these green energy systems, including power conversion, electrical current/voltage sensing, battery bank charging and system control and status communications.
• Resource Efficiency – Broadcom strives to use our resources in the most efficient manner possible. Broadcom has implemented a number of projects across the company, which have the effect of reducing our environmental impact and increasing our resource efficiency.

For example, our Global Operations, which includes our procurement and supply chain activities, use detailed Business Continuity Plans to manage potential climate-related interruptions to its operations, among other risks. All of our global sites have Site Control Plans, which provide our response plans in the event of various emergency situations, including climate-related weather events, like wildfires, hurricanes, flooding and blizzards.
