The Sony Group Code of Conduct. 
Approach to Sustainability. 
The Sony Group Code of Conduct. 
The Sony Group Code of Conduct (the “Code”) sets forth the basic standards of ethical and responsible business conduct that must be followed by all Sony directors, officers, and employees (“Sony Group personnel”) in their daily work.
The Code requires that we ask if our business conduct contributes to a better future, not only for Sony, but also for society as a whole. The Code provides a set of guiding principles to conduct our business activities on a principled path. Staying true to the Code helps ensure Sony’s long-term success, which in turn is based on the trust of stakeholders.
Sony’s Purpose, which is to fill the world with emotion through the power of creativity and technology, challenges Sony Group personnel to create new value, as well as to contribute to stakeholders from a long-term perspective. In pursuing this Purpose, in accordance with our Values, it is crucial that we follow the Code.
Sony manages diverse businesses with people at the core, and aims for sustainable value creation based on such diversity and mid-to long-term growth in the Sony Group's corporate value under its Purpose to “fill the world with emotion, through the power of creativity and technology,” and its Corporate Direction of “getting closer to people.”
In order to have people connected to each other through emotion, it is necessary to create a society in which everyone can live with peace of mind in a healthy global environment. Sony acts with due consideration of the impact of its business activities on stakeholders, including shareholders, customers, employees, suppliers, business partners, local communities and other organizations as well as the global environment, and focuses on building trust with stakeholders through dialogue.
Through innovation and sound business practice, Sony endeavors to enhance its corporate value and contribute to the development of a sustainable society.

Organizational Structure. 
Organizational Structure for Sustainability Initiatives. 
Sony’s organizational structure for sustainability initiatives is spearheaded by the Sustainability Section at Sony Group Corporation headquarters, which in turn operates under the supervision of the. 
Senior Executive in charge of Sustainability, who is appointed by the. 
Board of Directors.
Sustainability Initiatives • Formulate sustainability-related policies for the entire Sony Group • Monitor sustainability-related activities • Pursue sustainability activities in management and business units • Disclose information to stakeholders and promote dialogue • Raise employee awareness • Report to the Board of Directors. 
Formulating and Monitoring of Sustainability-Related Policies. 
The Sustainability Section formulates sustainability-related policies for the entire Sony Group, pursuing and monitoring sustainability activities. It also reports on various external inputs to the Senior. 
Executive in charge of Sustainability, and ensures that these inputs are fed back to the management team and sections in charge of headquarters functions (including legal, compliance, corporate communication, environment, product quality, procurement, investor relations, human resources, and marketing). Accordingly, Sony addresses sustainability from a Group-wide perspective and incorporates issues into management action as necessary.
The Sustainability Section and other sections in charge of headquarters functions then implement sustainability activities throughout the Group by ensuring that Sony’s policies and initiatives are conveyed to business units and group companies around the world.
Pursuing Sustainability Activities in Management and Business Units. 
Starting from fiscal year 2020, Sony has adopted a key performance indicator for sustainability initiatives as part of the evaluation pertaining to the remuneration linked to business results for Senior. 
Executives. In addition, from fiscal year 2021, Sony is incorporating initiatives that address sustainability issues into the mid-range plans of each of its businesses, such as measures related to employees and the environment identified as key to each respective business, and Sony has set KPIs for those initiatives as part of its business performance evaluations.
Information Disclosure and Dialogue with Stakeholders. 
Through the issuance of various reports such as its Corporate Report and Sustainability Report, and through its ESG Briefing and websites,
Sony communicates its approach to sustainability and information about initiatives regarding sustainability.

Sony recognizes the importance of boosting employee awareness of sustainability and engages in a variety of initiatives to do so.

on sustainability as a key element of our management approach. I have particularly focused on integrating sustainability activities that were previously driven by Sony headquarters into the operations of each individual business, and the top management in Sony’s various businesses are now taking the lead in promoting sustainability initiatives.
Sustainability and ESG are positioned as important themes in board meetings, which are attended primarily by outside directors with diverse experience and expertise. The progress of the various sustainability initiatives is regularly reported to the Board, and the Board deliberates and approves sustainability policy. In order for Sony to also strengthen its governance from the viewpoint of sustainability, starting from fiscal year 2020, Sony has adopted a key performance indicator for sustainability initiatives as part of the evaluation pertaining to the remuneration linked to business results for Senior Executives. In addition, from fiscal year 2021, we are incorporating initiatives that address sustainability issues into the mid-range plans of each of our businesses, such as measures related to employees and the environment identified as key to each respective business, and we have set KPIs for those initiatives as part of our business performance evaluations.
Sony is making various efforts regarding the global environment from the two perspectives of responsibility and contribution. Sony has pursued environmental initiatives in accordance with its environmental principles since the early 1990s. And in 2010, we announced the Road to. 
Zero, a long-term global environmental plan that aims to realize a sustainable society by achieving a zero environmental footprint throughout the life cycle of Sony’s products and business activities by the year 2050, and drew and carried out a comprehensive roadmap to achieve the goals of the plan.
The Road to Zero plan symbolizes Sony’s responsibility for the global environment. However, as climate change risks become more apparent and serious worldwide, and the transition to a decarbonized society has become an urgent issue, Sony decided in May 2022 to accelerate its environmental impact reduction activities in the climate change area and to bring forward the target year of achieving a zero environmental footprint in this area by ten years. It aims for carbon neutrality of all emissions, including those covered by Scope 3, by 2040. Sony has also accelerated the goal of achieving 100% renewable electricity used at its own sites by ten years, from 2040 to 2030. To this aim, Sony will implement measures such as continuing to reduce environmental impact at its own sites, further promoting the energy efficiency of its products, encouraging its partners to take action and contributing to carbon removal and fixation.
Sony is also actively working to contribute to the global environment through its own technologies and businesses, as well as through co-creation with partners. Intelligent vision sensors are one example of this. Using AI to analyze and process images reduces the amount of data uploaded to the cloud, while also addressing security and privacy concerns and enabling a reduction in power consumption. Sony is working with various partners to develop and deliver next-generation solutions that utilize its intelligent vision sensors.
In recent years, corporations are facing ever more complex and diverse human rights issues. Sony respects the human rights of all stakeholders involved in its business operations and strives to prevent and mitigate potential adverse impact on human rights.
Sony’s goal is to create value for society through an array of businesses centered on people. Sony is fostering diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) throughout the entire Group, where differences in background, gender and ability are viewed as strengths. The Group is also promoting initiatives aimed at fostering diversity and social justice in its engagement with greater society.
In 2020, Sony established the Global Social Justice Fund to support initiatives that promote social justice and human rights and foster DE&I around the world. We also established the Sony Global Relief Fund for. 
COVID-19 to support those around the world affected by COVID-19. In order to provide humanitarian aid for people impacted by the conflict in. 
Ukraine and those who have taken refuge in neighboring countries, in. 
March 2022 Sony made donations to relevant international organizations and NGOs, and employees held fund-raising initiatives.
Regarding human rights risks in the supply chain of electronics products, we are strengthening our efforts to implement the Sony. 
Supply Chain Code of Conduct, and we are also working collaboratively with global companies and other stakeholders.
Sony actively discloses its sustainability-related initiatives through ESG briefings, the Corporate Report and the Sustainability Report. We also place great importance on dialogue with our stakeholders. Sony Group employees are also important stakeholders, and, in addition to top management’s commitment to sustainability initiatives, Sony strives to foster a corporate culture in which each employee recognizes that sustainability is an issue that affects them personally. Sony has established sustainability awards as an in-house award system to encourage initiatives in each business and region. We also strive to boost employee awareness of sustainability by sharing information at online meetings for all Sony Group employees and by holding forums.
Going forward, Sony will continue to engage in dialogue with various stakeholders, develop our sustainability initiatives even further, and fulfill our responsibility and contribution to society and the global environment.
Sony’s responsibility and contribution to Society and the Global Environment. 
Sony develops diverse businesses globally in alignment with its purpose to “fill the world with emotion, through the power of creativity and technology” and corporate direction of “getting closer to people.” The. 
Sony Group Code of Conduct states, “It is the core corporate responsibility of Sony to society to pursue its corporate value enhancement through innovation and sound business practices and contribute to developing a sustainable society.”
For Sony to continue to provide emotion and create social value, it is necessary for the society and global environment in which we live to be healthy. Our daily lives, and Sony Group businesses, are being significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, extreme weather events around the world, and various social issues including those related to human rights and diversity, providing a stark reminder that the health of the global environment and society is not something we can take for granted.
It is our responsibility to directly acknowledge the environmental and social impact of our business operations and take appropriate action to minimize and redress them. At Sony, we can also make contributions to solving environmental and social issues through our technologies and businesses, and I believe this is becoming an increasingly important consideration.
At Sony, ever since our founding, we have continued to uphold the principle of creating value for the society in which we operate. Since 2018, under the leadership of CEO Kenichiro Yoshida, Sony has focused.

Step 1 Identify and classify material topics. 
Step 2 Assess topics from the perspective of Sony and its stakeholders. 
Step 3 Identify the most important topics. 
Materiality. 
Overview and Purpose of Materiality Analysis. 
The Sony Group develops diverse businesses globally. Sony recognizes that stakeholders expect it to maintain a well-defined stance and take action to address the issues facing society and the global environment, in addition to delivering emotional experiences through its business.
In response to such expectations, and to various social and environmental changes, Sony reviewed material topics in sustainability from the standpoints of all its businesses in FY2022. In that process, Sony designated creativity and technology, two components of its Purpose, as drivers for value creation along with diversity of employees and businesses, and defined materiality as “material topics that are related to sustainability, impact Sony’s value creation, and are determined with longer-term social change and diverse stakeholder needs in mind.”
The Materiality Assessment Process. 
Step 1: Identify and classify material topics. 
Based on internal and external information and documents, Sony selected material topics with high relevance. References included the. 
Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards and the Sustainability. 
Accounting Standards Board (SASB) standards, which are global guidelines for sustainability reporting, the ISO 26000 international standard for corporate social responsibility, and the SDGs, which are globally agreed goals for building a sustainable world.
Step 2: Assess the topics from the perspective of Sony and its stakeholders. 
The topics identified and classified in the Step 1 were assessed from the perspectives of Sony and its stakeholders.
The senior executives in charge of Sony headquarters functions assessed each topic from the angle of its mid- to long-term positive or negative impact on value creation at Sony to determine its importance from the company’s perspective.
The assessment of the importance of each topic from the perspective of stakeholders was based on information published by NGOs, investors, ESG rating agencies, the mass media and other sources.
Step 3: Identify the most important topics. 
The most important topics were specified after being reviewed by top management and the Board of Directors on the basis of the assessment conducted in Step 2.
Analysis Results and Sony Group Material Topics. 
As a result of the aforementioned assessment process, climate change; diversity, equity and inclusion; respect for human rights; and technology for sustainability as the most important.
The Sustainability Report 2022 classifies Sony’s material topics, including the above, into eight categories: environment, employees, respect for human rights, responsible supply chain, quality and customer service, community engagement, ethics and compliance, and corporate governance.

Intelligent Vision Sensors “IMX500”: Edge AI Solutions That Help Solve Social Issues. 
In May 2020, Sony Semiconductor Solutions Corporation (SSS) announced the commercial release of its IMX500 intelligent vision sensors, the first image sensors in the world to be equipped with AI processing functionality. They feature a stacked configuration consisting of a pixel chip and logic chip, which are key technologies of SSS image sensors. The logic chip is equipped with SSS’s original. 
DSP (Digital Signal Processor) dedicated to AI signal processing, and embedded memory for the AI model.
The spread of the IoT has made cloud AI processing systems commonplace. However there is a concern that this will lead to increased CO2 emissions as IP traffic and data center electricity consumption rise due to higher data volumes from a growing number of IoT devices. Edge AI processing addresses these problems by employing IoT devices that process and analyze data.
SSS developed the IMX500 to be capable of outputting the desired metadata as semantic information. Because it only extracts necessary data, the data transmission latency, power consumption, and communication costs are reduced. Furthermore, privacy concerns are addressed by not outputting information that can identify an individual.
One next-generation solution utilizing the IMX500 is an initiative to curb climate change. The issue being tackled is that most commercial buildings currently keep their heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems running whether people are present or not. Nomad Go is an. 
American company that creates computer vision technology. With the aim of finding a solution to that issue, it utilized the IMX500 and. 
Microsoft’s Azure AI to effectively develop an intelligent building solution. Computer vision technology detects whether people are present in a commercial space and, if so, how many for how long. It precisely adjusts the room air conditioning as necessary, reducing energy use and the associated greenhouse gas emissions. SSS also announced the launch of its AITRIOS™* edge AI sensing platform in. 
October 2021. AITRIOS is a one-stop platform that provides various partners involved in development with all the features they need to efficiently develop and deploy solutions. The platform supports partners in efforts to build optimal systems in which the edge and the cloud function in synergy and address global environmental issues, thereby helping to solve issues with cloud systems.

IoT for a Sustainable Society: Sony’s Earth MIMAMORI platform. 
In order to realize a sustainable society, it is necessary to constantly protect various regions such as mountain forests, satoyama (woodlands surrounding rural settlements), rivers, and coasts.
Furthermore, it requires the detection of anomalies to prevent problems from arising, instead of addressing environmental issues after they have already arisen. Such systems can only be realized through the ability to acquire and transmit data in a global sensor network extending to mountainous and coastal areas not serviced by conventional mobile networks. They also require devices and networks that can function in areas where electricity service is difficult.

STAR SPHERE. 
In August 2020, Sony announced the development of a nano/ micro-satellite equipped with Sony camera equipment that can be operated by users to shoot images, and a joint development and technology demonstration agreement with the University of Tokyo and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA).
Up until now, space missions for industrial purposes such as planetary exploration or space communication and surveys have dominated, and only a few people, such as astronauts, have experienced manned space flights. Believing it important that ordinary people can experience the universe for themselves and see. 
Earth in a new light, as a planet in space, if humanity is to create sustainable societies and find solutions to environmental issues,
Sony, the University of Tokyo and JAXA founded STAR SPHERE, a project that takes “Unleash Space” as its motto. The three partners aim to launch a man-made satellite in 2022.
The STAR SPHERE satellite will be highly maneuverable with 360 degree attitude control so that members of the public can explore and discover new aspects of the Earth and stars through the camera, such as the ever-changing hues of the aurora for example. Since half of the satellite’s orbit will be at night, it will be installed with Sony high-sensitivity image sensors to help boost its environmental efficiency in operations such as the visualization of night-time economic activity. Sony intends to deliver “an experience connecting space and reality” via images captured in real time by checking the live stream from the camera when the satellite passes over an antenna on the ground station.
Up until now, satellites have been operated by specialized engineers, but Sony released a prototype shooting simulator in January 2022 that is simple and fun for laymen to use. Web content has been used to give the simulator intuitive operability, and Sony’s Mapray 3D web map technology is leveraged for beautiful expression - the map data is optimized for 3D. The simulator can set shooting sequences as well as time frames for images to be shot.
Space is also a place where we can learn about Earth, and Sony has launched the Space Inspiration Competition in tandem with schools and educational institutes to use the power of entertainment to expand people’s view of space.
Going forward, Sony aims to help to make people aware of just how precious Earth is by letting them see it from space, and to contribute to building a sustainable society where that value is shared worldwide. Method of open-field agriculture and augmenting ecosystems by utilizing the self-organizing power of the ecosystem. 
Sony has a range of technologies to realize these systems. • IMX500, intelligent vision sensor equipped with AI processing functionality • Low-power edge AI devices such as SPRESENSE™ that offer advanced sensing in a battery-powered device • Radio signal processing technology that enables low power and low bitrate data transmission with a range of over 1,000 km • Prediction One, an analysis tool that makes useful predictions from the data collected. 
And more. 
Combining these technologies enables sensing all around the world, even in locations where humankind is not active. The data from such sensing can be collected by low-orbit satellites and the necessary information relayed to human society via AI processing. Sony calls this concept “MIMAMORI” and is engaged in research and development to make this mechanism to change human behavior patterns a reality. Within frameworks such as a comprehensive alliance with the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and the Social Innovation Division for Planetary Boundary established at. 
Hokkaido University, Sony is collaborating with external partners in joint research and demonstration tests at various locations around the globe. These projects will help to prevent environmental destruction and predict emergencies such as river flooding and wildfires, as well as increase agricultural and livestock productivity.

Materiality Rationale. 
Sony’s corporate activities are only possible if the earth, which sustains all life on earth, is healthy. This is why Sony is so determined to fight climate change, preserve resources, manage chemical substances, conserve biodiversity, and take other needed steps to protect the environment.
True to this commitment, Sony conducts its business in a sustainable manner and provides environmentally conscious products and services, always seeking to deliver innovation and develop uniquely superior technologies. Sony also works hand-in-hand with stakeholders to help build a more sustainable society.
The Basics. 
Since the early 1990s, Sony has pursued environmental initiatives in accordance with its environmental principles and targets. In April 2010,
Sony announced the “Road to Zero,” a new global environmental plan, the goal of which is to realize a sustainable society by achieving a zero environmental footprint throughout the life cycle of its products and business activities by the year 2050. In May 2022, Sony made the decision to bring forward the target year of achieving a zero environmental footprint in the climate change area by ten years from 2050 to 2040.
Working toward a zero environmental footprint, once every five years. 
Sony sets concrete medium-term environmental targets for each stage of the life cycle for its products with respect to climate change, resources, chemical substances, and biodiversity.
Structure. 
Sony is implementing and continually improving its globally integrated environmental management system with the aim of realizing the Sony. 
Group Environmental Vision, achieving its medium-term environmental targets and complying fully with legal requirements, regulatory demands and internal policies established for the Group.

Accelerating Measures Against Climate Change. 
Progress To Date and Acceleration of Achievement Targets. 
The transition to a decarbonized society is a pressing issue for the global community.
Sony is putting effort into measures against climate change from two perspectives: responsibility to aim to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions to zero, and contribution to innovation for industry and society.
Since the early 1990s, Sony has been operating under environmentally-conscious policies and action plans. Road to Zero, an environmental plan established in 2010, is designed to reduce the Group’s environmental footprint to zero by 2050 by following a specific road map including goals set from four perspectives on environment, namely: climate change, resources, chemical substances and biodiversity. To address climate change, Sony has committed to reducing greenhouse-gas emissions to zero in both business operations and in its products throughout their life cycles.
Sony sets medium-term environmental targets every five years, backcasting from the final goals of the plan for 2050, with each business pursuing its respective action plan to achieve them.
The current mindset in society in response to the increasingly serious effects of climate change is to support requiring corporations worldwide to accelerate measures to address climate change. For example, the international Science Based. 
Targets initiative (SBTi) now stipulates a global temperature rise of 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels as the new target level, rather than the 2°C target set by the 2015 Paris Agreement, as well as establishing standards for net zero targets.
Under these circumstances, Sony announced in May 2022 that it will push forward its goal of achieving net zero throughout the entire value chain, moving the target year from 2050 to efficiency being improved by 30% compared to the FY2015 level.
Across the entire life cycle of Sony products, greenhouse-gas emissions are highest when they consume electricity during customer use. With that in mind, Sony will pursue innovation in areas such as product design while accelerating initiatives promoting a net zero society.
Specifically, Sony is exploring investment opportunities in startups working on technology for the environment, mainly through the. 
Sony Innovation Fund: Environment, a corporate venture capital fund established in 2020, as well as through making proposals to national governments and industry associations worldwide.
Carbon removal/fixation is a particularly vital challenge to meet in order to realize net zero carbon emissions by 2040. Going forward, Sony is looking into various technologies leading to solutions, such as exploring credit generation from carbon absorption associated with augmented ecosystem businesses such as Synecoculture™ being rolled out by a Group company,
SynecO, Inc. Sony will contribute to carbon fixation via both technological removal and natural absorption by ecosystems.
2040. Specifically, this entails making direct and indirect emissions from its own operations (Scopes 1 and 2) carbon neutral by 2030. Sony has also accelerated its goal to achieve 100% renewable energy in its own operations by ten years, from 2040 to 2030 (see the chart above). Moreover, Sony’s net zero target for 2040 was approved as the net zero target for the. 
Science Based Targets initiative in August 2022.
Priority Initiatives to Achieve New Targets. 
To achieve these new targets, the Sony Group will continue to make an across-the-board effort to promote the use of renewable energy at all its business sites while reducing energy consumption. One example is the new Fab5 building at the. 
Nagasaki Technology Center for image sensor production, which commenced operations in April 2021. Here, AI-assisted advanced control technology has been employed in semiconductor production to operate clean-room chillers and boilers, along with a system to recycle waste heat from production equipment to drive boilers, resulting in clean-room energy consumption.

Basic Policy. 
Sony reduces our environmental footprint and prevents environmental pollution throughout the lifecycle of our products and business activities by complying with all applicable environmental regulations and also by continually improving our global environmental management systems. Sony formulates the following goals in four key environmental perspectives and takes proactive actions to achieve those goals.
Climate Change. 
Sony reduces energy consumption and strives to achieve zero emissions of greenhouse gases* generated throughout the lifecycle of our products, service and business activities.
* Gases that raise the temperature of the earth’s surface by absorbing infrared radiation from reflected sunlight. Seven typical examples are carbon dioxide (CO2), methane, nitrous oxides, hydrofluorocarbons (HFC), perfluorocarbons (PFC), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3)
Resources Conservation. 
In order to minimize resource inputs for our business activities, Sony identifies “Key Resources” and strives to achieve zero usage of those virgin materials. Sony also uses water efficiently, minimizes wastes from sites and maximizes our effort for take back and recycling products from markets.
Management of Chemical Substances. 
Sony minimizes the risk of chemical substances that we use causing serious harm to human health and the environment. Sony maintains strict control over the chemical substances we use, while, in line with the precautionary approach, taking steps whenever possible to reduce, substitute and eliminate the use of substances that have potentially significant impacts on the environment even in the cases where scientific evidence is not fully proven.
Biodiversity Conservation. 
Sony protects and utilizes ecosystem services in a sustainable manner, while actively promoting maintenance and recovery of biodiversity through our business and local contribution activities.
In order to realize the Environmental Vision, Sony formulates targets and concrete plans and initiates actions to implement, while contributing to a better society through partnerships and communications with internal and external stakeholders.
Environmental Plan “Road to Zero,” Sony’s Global Environmental Plan. 
As stated in the Sony Group Environmental Vision, Sony strives to realize a sustainable society by achieving a zero environmental footprint throughout the life cycle of its products and business activities. It is this long-term goal that prompted Sony to name its new global environmental plan “Road to Zero.” Under this plan, Sony aims to bring its environmental footprint to zero by 2050 and works to achieve medium-term environmental targets toward this end. In. 
May 2022, Sony made the decision to bring forward the target year of achieving a zero environmental footprint in the climate change area by ten years from 2050 to 2040.
“Road to Zero,” Sony’s Global Environmental Plan. 
Sony Group Environmental Vision. 
The Sony Group Environmental Vision presents a philosophy and principles for environmental management activities throughout the global Sony Group with the aim of contributing to the realization of a sustainable society. Since enacting the Sony Global Environmental. 
Policy which is a predecessor of the Sony Group Environmental Vision and the Environmental Action Program, in 1993, Sony has pursued a broad range of environmental initiatives. Concurrent with the formulation of its Road to Zero global environmental plan, in 2010,
Sony revised the Sony Group Environmental Vision.
Philosophy. 
Sony recognizes the importance of preserving the natural environment that sustains all life on the earth for future generations and thereby ensuring that all humanity can attain a healthy and enriched life. In order to realize such sustainable society, Sony strives to achieve a zero environmental footprint throughout the lifecycle of our products and business activities.

product packaging. Sony aims to reduce the number of parts derived from virgin resources to zero by identifying certain key resources* in terms of environmental impact due to the depletion, uneven distribution and mining of resources, loss of biodiversity due to mining, and the effects of these impacts on local communities.
In terms of waste, Sony recycles waste generated from internal operations, with the goal of eliminating landfilled waste. Additionally,
Sony designs products to facilitate recycling and implements ongoing programs to collect and recycle end-of-life products according to the needs of local communities, while also promoting advanced recycling with recycling companies.
* At Sony, “key resources” are designated by taking the following factors into account: resource depletion, resource availability, environment impact of resource extraction, and loss of biodiversity and community impacts from resource extraction.
Focus on Water Use. 
Although water circulates around the earth continuously through the water cycle, the amount of water available for use by the planet’s inhabitants is limited. With population growth and other issues putting further pressure on water supplies, the importance of conserving this resource will increase in the years ahead. Taking into account the locations of its sites, as well as regional differences, Sony will continue taking steps to minimize its withdrawal of water and to ensure the water it returns to water sources is of a quality that does not negatively impact the environment.
Focus on Paper Resources. 
Recognizing that paper resources are limited, under the Sony Group. 
Paper / Printed Material Purchasing Policy, Sony constantly works to reduce paper consumption while prioritizing the procurement of environmentally preferable paper, such as paper made from resources sourced from certified forests and recycled paper.
Sony Group Paper / Printed Material Purchasing Policy [PDF: 427KB]
Focus on Chemical Substances. 
Sony endeavors to minimize the risk that chemical substances it uses might cause serious harm to human health and the environment.
Chemical substances used in Sony products are suitably managed based on available data including national regulations, toxicity, environmental impacts, applications, and content level in components and products. Sony adopts a precautionary approach and takes steps to identify and strive to eliminate substances considered to be high-risk, even in cases where scientific evidence is insufficient, thereby reducing potential impact on the environment. Sony manages the type and application of chemical substances used at business sites, and for high risk substances sets criteria for managing each substance to either prohibit their use or reduce emissions or amounts transferred. Sony also prohibits the use of certain substances in manufacturing processes in the supply chain which are restricted under international frameworks because of environmental impacts throughout the life cycle.
Focus on Biodiversity. 
Recognizing the importance of natural capital,*1 as the very foundation of human life, and the ecosystem services*2 it supplies,
Sony endeavors to maintain and recover biodiversity, both in its business activities and through community initiatives.
At each stage of the product lifecycle, Sony business activities are either dependent on or related to natural capital and biodiversity. We set and work toward goals with this in mind, especially at stages where this link is particularly prominent. For example, Sony aims to eliminate parts derived from virgin resources and prevent the loss of biodiversity due to mining in our procurement of raw materials and parts. For paper resources closely tied to biodiversity, we are continuing efforts to reduce the amount of paper used, and prioritize the purchase of environmentally conscious paper.
Land use is another factor causing the loss and deterioration of biodiversity. In response, Sony promotes nature restoration and biodiversity conservation efforts that meet regional needs for the green areas on the premises of Sony sites as well as the surrounding area. Sony takes seriously the issue of plastic pollution in the oceans, which has become a worldwide crisis in recent years. We promote activities to reduce the amount of plastics used in products and in manufacturing sites, as well as the collection of plastic waste and cleanup activities at sites.
Sony also recognizes that food is essential to the lives all our employees and humanity as a whole. This is also linked to environmental issues such as soil pollution, deforestation, food loss and global warming.
We work to communicate these issues to our employees and encourage them to have an environmentally conscious diet.
*1 The natural assets include elements of the natural environment such as forests, rivers, the atmosphere and soil, as well as living organisms. Natural capital is the source of ecosystem services, fossil fuels and minerals.
*2 Services produced by natural capital and received by humans from nature include groundwater, lumber, and climate regulation.
Four Focus Points for a Zero Environmental Footprint. 
Sony efforts to achieve a zero environmental footprint focus on four important environmental perspectives: climate change, resources, chemical substances, and biodiversity.
Focus on Climate Change. 
Sony aims to achieve zero greenhouse gas emissions in its business activities, as well as throughout the entire life cycle of its products and services. In order to reduce emissions, we conduct scenario analysis* in accordance with TCFD Recommendations, analyze and ascertain climate-related risks and opportunities, and review the countermeasures. To achieve zero greenhouse gas emissions, Sony works to maximize energy-saving measures and introduce as much renewable energy as possible. In addition to such measures as reducing the amount of electricity used at business sites, promoting the installation of solar power generation equipment, and maximizing energy efficiency in Sony products and services, Sony also encourages similar measures in the supply chain, including at contract manufacturers and suppliers of raw materials and components, to reduce direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions. Sony also investigates ways to offset any greenhouse gas emissions that might remain through efforts such as carbon removal.
* See below for more information on scenario analysis in accordance with TCFD. 
Recommendations.
Disclosure of Climate-related Information in Accordance with the TCFD Recommendations. 
Focus on Resources. 
Sony seeks to minimize the consumption of resources and maximize resource recycling in order to use resources effectively in its business activities and throughout the life cycle of its products and services, based on the globally prescribed promotion of a circular economy. Sony minimizes resource consumption by reducing the weight of products, minimizing the use of packaging materials, and utilizing resources more efficiently in its internal operations. Concurrently, Sony also works to extend the life of products through quality and durability enhancements, while undertaking environmentally conscious design, such as making products easier to repair, in order to indirectly reduce resource consumption. Additionally, as part of its efforts to respond to the growing global problem of plastic pollution in the ocean, Sony continues to work toward reducing the amount of single-use plastic.

Green Management 2025 in Context. 
In light of the urgent environmental issue of climate change, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions must be reduced to virtually zero by 2050 in order to keep the global average temperature increase below 1.5°C as recommended in the Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C approved by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)* in 2018. In order to realize a decarbonized world with virtually zero GHG emissions, companies will need to develop energy saving products, introduce renewable energy, and reduce emissions throughout their supply chains. At the same time, in order to achieve sustainable use of resources, economic growth must be balanced with environmental impact; societies must shift to circular economies; and the recent problem of ocean plastic pollution must be addressed.
* IPCC: Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. 
Formulating Green Management 2025. 
Sony believes that encouraging business partners, consumers, and other stakeholders to take action and work together to build a sustainable world is equally as important as its own environmental activities. When formulating Green Management 2025, Sony examined its past environmental activities and conducted a group- wide materiality analysis focused on what is important to Sony, its stakeholders and society at large. Based on these results and the wider social context, Sony reaffirmed the importance of the four environmental aspects that it has been working to address: climate change, resources, chemical substances, and biodiversity. The following three areas are particular key priorities.
Focus Point 1: Improve Energy- and Resource-Efficiency of Products. 
Sony continues to pursue energy efficiency during product use, which accounts for the majority of GHG emissions throughout the life cycle of its products. In addition to minimizing the consumption of resources, Sony takes action to reduce the amount of plastic used in products and packaging in order to address the growing problem of ocean plastic pollution.
Focus Point 2: Expand Renewable Energy Use. 
Sony is a member of RE100 and aims to achieve 100% renewable electricity utilization at all Sony Group sites by 2030.* Sony will further accelerate efforts to achieve this goal by expanding the use of renewable electricity to at least 35%* of the total amount of electricity used at all Sony sites around the world.
* Revised May 2022. 
RE100 Membership. 
Focus Point 3: Enhance Supply Chain Engagement to Reduce Environment Impact. 
Sony has been working to reduce the environmental impact of the entire supply chain by working even more closely with raw material and component suppliers and contractors to which it outsources manufacturing. Sony endeavors to further enhance its engagement with these partners, encouraging them to set targets for reducing. 
GHG emissions and water consumption and managing their progress.
In addition, Sony has helped raise awareness of the Sustainable. 
Development Goals (SDGs), including those in relation to the environment, through its entertainment content reaching more than 2 billion people around the world. Green Management 2025 also focuses on promoting these activities and encouraging engagement in environmental activities with the aim of getting over 2.5 million people to take action.
Specific Green Management 2025 Targets.

Green Management 2025. 
Medium-Term Environmental Targets. 
Sony is working toward its goal of having a “zero environmental footprint”, setting medium-term (5-year) environmental targets progressively backcasted from targets based on current achievement levels. This approach will enable Sony to work steadily toward achieving the zero environmental footprint goal, while making ongoing adjustments based on current progress. In 2011, Sony established the Green Management 2015 medium-term environmental targets (fiscal year 2011–2015), which was the first step on the road to a zero environmental footprint, and took the second step in 2016 with the Green Management 2020 medium-term environmental targets (fiscal year 2016–2020). Sony is currently implementing initiatives to achieve the goals it has set under the Green Management 2025 medium-term environmental targets (fiscal year 2021–2025).

energy used by sites, and volume of waste generated. To ensure the effective functioning of the PDCA cycle, Sony has created an environmental document structure in line with the requirements of. 
ISO 14001. The structure covers overall elements of environmental management such as management procedures on site and in the business groups, internal environmental communications, efforts to make products more environmentally conscious, and internal audits.
Another means by which the Sony Group facilitates environmental action is to provide broad environmental education for employees that is tailored to specific objectives or the type of work they perform.
Environmental Audits. 
Sony has established an integrated environmental audit system that combines three kinds of audits — internal, corporate and external — and aims to facilitate continual improvements to the Sony Group’s environmental management system, prevent environmental accidents at sites, and ensure the reliability of environmental data. In internal audits, business units and sites independently confirm the effectiveness of their own organization’s environmental management system. In corporate audits, headquarters or regional environmental offices conduct audits of business units and sites in order to verify compliance with corporate rules. In external audits, an external certification body conducts audits to determine the effectiveness of environmental management systems throughout the Sony Group.
Continual Improvement by Using the PDCA Cycle. 
In compliance with ISO 14001, the global standard for environmental management systems that is based on the rationale of the Plan-Do-
Check-Act (PDCA) cycle, Sony’s corporate headquarters conducts annual assessments of the environmental impact of the entire Sony. 
Group and, after identifying risks and opportunities, incorporates its findings into medium-term environmental targets and annual plans.
In line with these plans, individual business units and sites establish and implement their own annual plans, incorporating essential elements of guiding principles established by the headquarters.
Progress on the implementation of these business plans is reviewed regularly by a committee that is headed by the officer in charge of environmental affairs, contributing to ongoing improvement efforts.
Awards are given annually at the global level to recognize outstanding activities in core businesses. For all businesses of the. 
Sony Group (except for certain operations such as the financial services), the results of environmental initiatives are assessed as part of the annual review of business results, and the assessment is used to determine bonuses for employees of Sony’s main business units.
Additionally, environment related matters are taken into account as a factor in evaluating the remuneration linked to business results of. 
Senior Executives and Senior Vice Presidents in charge of each business unit.

Specialized Functions for Environmental Management. 
In order to promote a wide range of measures, such as manufacturing and sales of environmentally conscious products, recycling of its products and environmental management at its sites, Sony has a dedicated headquarters that oversees environmental management for the entire Group based on the Sony Group Environmental Vision.
It sets goals and rules and monitors performance. There are also specialized functions at this environmental headquarters, specifically in the areas related to energy consumed at sites and by products; resource conservation, including recycling; chemical substance management; biodiversity conservation; procurement; logistics; and communications. Each specialized function is integrated and linked with related fields and internal organizations such as quality assurance, customer service, occupational health and safety, and disaster prevention, to create an even more effective management system.
The environmental headquarters is overseen by senior management, and a Sony Group Corporation corporate executive officer assumes ultimate responsibility. The president of Sony Group Corporation and other executives share information on environmental issues of importance to the Sony Group in regularly-held executive meetings.
Additionally, to promote integrated environmental management globally, Sony has established six regional environmental offices to facilitate region-wide environmental management activities, such as a better understanding of local legal and regulatory trends, effective communication of standards and instructions set forth by headquarters to the regional divisions and sites, and effective performance of audits at all regional business divisions and sites. These are the North.

Overview of Sony’s Environmental Impact. 
Assessing Greenhouse Gas Emissions over the Entire Value Chain. 
The recent escalation of climate change issues has prompted corporations to broaden the scope of efforts to ascertain the greenhouse gas emissions not just of their own operations but also those throughout their entire value chain.*1 Sony has determined emissions from its major component suppliers and manufacturing contractors. Furthermore, based on the level of emissions identified,
Sony has estimated greenhouse gas emissions for its entire value chain.*2 The amount of greenhouse gas emissions from Sony’s overall value chain in fiscal year 2021 is estimated to be approximately 17.36 million tons. The largest volume of emissions, approximately 10.73 million tons, was from “energy consumed during product use.”
The next largest category was “goods and services procured,” which includes raw materials and components, at approximately 3.81 million tons. Sony will continue to strive to identify and manage greenhouse gas emissions over the entire value chain.
*1 Value chain refers to the entire product life cycle process, from procurement of materials through to manufacturing, use and disposal. It includes upstream and downstream manufacturing processes.
*2 Estimated greenhouse gas emissions are calculated in accordance with the.

Governance. 
Under the Companies Act of Japan, Sony Group Corporation has adopted the “Company with Three Committees” corporate governance system as the most appropriate system for the company.
Under this system, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) determines. 
Sony’s fundamental management policies and other material matters, while broadly delegating the decision-making authority to conduct Sony’s business operation to Senior Executives in line with their respective responsibilities as defined by the Board, with a view to promoting timely and efficient decision-making within Sony.
The Board regularly deliberates and decides upon the mid-term management plan and annual business plan, taking into account various risks and opportunities, including climate change, in its deliberations and decisions. Senior Executives implement strategies according to the management plans and the business plan while carrying out business execution, and the Board receives and discusses reports on the status of business execution as needed.
With authority delegated by the Board, the CEO of Sony Group. 
Corporation, who is a member of the Board has responsibility and authority to establish and determine the Sony Group Environmental. 
Vision, which stipulates the corporate philosophy on the global environment and corporate principles including on climate change matters and medium-term environmental targets (Green Management 20XX) both are applicable to entire Sony. The Corporate Executive. 
Officer in charge of sustainability including environmental matters is appointed by the Board, then established the Sony Group Environmental. 
Management Structure, which consists of internal regulations that stipulate the basic framework for global environmental management at Sony. Through the environmental department, this Corporate. 
Executive Officer supervises the initiatives implemented by each business unit and business site to achieve the Sony Group Environmental. 
Vision, and also supervises their operation of and adherence to the. 
Sony Group Environmental Management Structure. In order to address the TCFD Recommendations, environmental department leads the analysis and identification of climate related risks and opportunities through scenario analysis and review the countermeasures. (For more details, see the following “Strategies” section.) The progress on initiatives implemented under this environmental execution framework are regularly reported to and reviewed by the Board.
The Compensation Committee has the authority to determine the compensation policy on the content of individual compensation for. 
Senior Executives and other officers, including the CEO, and to determine or oversee the amount of individual compensation paid to. 
Senior Executives. Sustainability including environmental matters is taken into account as a factor in evaluating remuneration linked to business results of Senior Executives. Furthermore, KPIs for initiatives to address sustainability issues that each business emphasizes are set and incorporated into the performance evaluation of each business.
Sony Group Environmental Vision. 
Environmental Management Structure. 
Strategies. 
Identifying and Addressing Business Risks. 
Tackling environmental issues is consistent with Sony’s commitment to build a sustainable world and is important in terms of ensuring business continuity. Sony seeks to identify various environment- related risks and address foreseeable risks. This applies to transition risks such as adoption of carbon taxes, regional expansion of emissions trading schemes, stronger regulation of energy efficiency standards for products, and market changes driven by shifting consumer attitudes. It also applies to physical risks such as abnormal weather events and sea level rise due to climate change.
Creating and Expanding Business Opportunities. 
Sony believes that tackling environmental issues also leads to business opportunities. For example, the Paris Agreement*1 that emerged from the COP 21*2 meeting in December 2015 addressed climate change issues, and with increasing public awareness, consumer demand is shifting toward energy-efficient products. Sony has already increased the energy efficiency of many of its products. In light of these social trends, demand for energy-efficient products may continue to grow. One example of this is the development of IMX500, an intelligent vision sensor with AI processing functionality in its image sensor logic chip. We expect it to be used in IoT fields. Processing information through the sensor on its edge enables the transmission of metadata only (semantic information). This reduces the amount of data transmitted to the cloud as well as the amount of data to be processed, which we believe will reduce power consumption.
*1 The Paris Agreement was adopted at COP 21 held in Paris, France and serves as an international framework for climate change action starting from 2020.
*2 COP 21 refers to the 21st session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).
Disclosure of Climate-related Information in Accordance with the TCFD Recommendations. 
Sony recognizes that its business depends upon the sustainability of the global environment and societies where people can live in security.
Based on this understanding, Sony is constantly moving forward with environmental and social initiatives throughout the value chain. In particular, Sony is tackling climate change as one of its priority issues.
On May 27, 2019, Sony Group Corporation announced its endorsement of the final report published by the Task Force on Climate-related. 
Financial Disclosures (the “TCFD Recommendations”) established by the Financial Stability Board. Sony Group Corporation also participates in the TCFD Consortium, which was established to facilitate implementation and discussion among companies and financial institutions that endorse the TCFD Recommendations in Japan. Sony. 
Group Corporation will continue its climate-related information disclosure in accordance with the TCFD Recommendations.
Policy on Climate Change. 
Sony reduces energy consumption and is striving to achieve zero emissions of greenhouse gases throughout the lifecycle of its products, service and business activities.
Specifically, Sony has designated the following initiatives to achieve its medium-term environmental targets, and is working to reduce direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions.
On-site • Promoting efficient energy use • Switching to energy sources that are lower in GHG emissions • Promoting use of renewable energy • Reducing GHG emissions from non-energy related sources.

Analysis Results and Countermeasures. 
As a result of two analyses based on the above prerequisites, recognized risks and opportunities and countermeasures which are unique to the I&SS segment and financial sector are as shown in the table below.
Based on the results of the above scenario analysis, the entire Sony. 
Group is working toward using 100% renewable electricity in its own operations by 2030 to achieve its RE100* target. Specifically, Sony. 
Group Corporation is examining measures such as directly purchasing renewable electricity from power utilities and purchasing renewable electricity certificates.
Along with these efforts, in each business segment, Sony develops and enhances risk management and business continuity plans (BCPs) from the perspective of improving risk management across supply chains, through the identification, analysis, and assessment of business continuity risks. Flood damage has grown in recent years due to the impact of climate change, prompting Sony to reassess the flood risk at its manufacturing sites in Japan and implement preventative measures that will mitigate flood damage and facilitate rapid recovery.
Sony is collaborating with relevant companies and organizations, and conducts hands-on drills to address foreseeable risks, in an effort to enhance business continuity and accelerate flood recovery.
Sony will continue to increase its resilience to climate change, based on its analyses and initiatives.
* A global initiative in which participating corporations aim to operate on 100% renewable electricity. It is headed by an international non-governmental organization, the Climate Group, in partnership with the CDP.
Scenario Analysis. 
Analysis Methodology and Assumptions. 
In accordance with the requirements of the TCFD Recommendations and advice from external experts, we have conducted Scenario. 
Analysis twice. The first analysis is on climate change impact for the. 
Sony Group conducted from September 2019 to July 2020 (excluding financial business. The same applies after in the first analysis).
To assess the impact of climate change across the Sony Group, each business segment assessed the degree to which climate change impacts its industry on a four-point scale of “Very Significant,” “Significant,” “Moderate,” and “Minor.” The rating was based on how often climate change impacts were mentioned in the guidelines and assessment methodologies for investors, ESG assessment institutions, and investor initiatives. Based on the analyses, climate change was found to have a moderate impact on the Imaging & Sensing Solutions (I&SS), Electronics Products & Solutions (Entertainment, Technology and. 
Services from April 1, 2022), and Game & Network Services segments, while having a minor impact on the Music and Pictures segments.
Of the three business areas that are moderately impacted by climate change, the I&SS segment generates the most greenhouse gas emissions. Sony Group Corporation conducted scenario analyses using multiple scenarios for the segment, in order to identify the risks and opportunities from changes in the external environment that are connected to climate change. For simplicity of analysis, it was assumed that the major businesses comprising the I&SS segment would not change significantly from fiscal year 2018 through fiscal year 2030. For the external environment in 2030, we used the 2°C*1 and 4°C*2 temperature rise scenarios predicted by the International. 
Energy Agency (IEA).
In the second analysis from November 2021 to March 2022 we targeted the financial sector, a key sector in TCFD Recommendations.
In order to evaluate impact across the entire financial sector, we conducted scenario analysis on Sony Life Insurance, Sony Assurance and Sony Bank based on individual business characteristics and the exposure of assets held. As prerequisite scenarios, we used the 1.5°C scenario,*3 the 2°C scenario*4 and the 4°C scenario.*5 *1 2°C scenario (IEA Sustainable Development Scenario, 2°C Scenario, Beyond 2°C. 
Scenario, IPCC Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5, RCP 2.6) *2 4°C scenario (IEA Stated Policies Scenario, New Policies Scenario, Current. 
Policies Scenario, Reference Technology Scenario, IPCC RCP 8.5) *3 1.5°C scenario (IEA Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario) *4 2°C scenario (IEA Sustainable Development Scenario, IPCC RCP 2.6) *5 4°C scenario (IEA Stated Policies Scenario, IPCC RCP 8.5)
I&SS segment. 
Financial sector. 
Assumed scenario Recognized risks and opportunities Countermeasures 2°C scenario. 
Stricter regulations due to national decarbonization polices worldwide and the introduction of carbon pricing will lead to an increase in crude oil and fossil fuel prices. As a result, manufacturing costs for semiconductors, which require large amounts of electricity to produce, will increase.
• Manufacturing sites outside Japan: Achieved 100% renewable electricity in fiscal year 2021.
• Manufacturing sites in Japan: Promote achieving 100% renewable electricity in the medium to long-term, including installing solar panels, purchasing renewable energy directly from power utilities and purchasing renewable electricity certificates.
2°C and 4°C scenarios. 
Progressive temperature rise increases the severity and frequency of abnormal weather, damaging Sony’s manufacturing sites and suppliers and reducing demand due to the disruption of the supply chain.
• Self-checks conducted annually at manufacturing sites, and regularly undergo on-site surveys dispatched from headquarters to establish a Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle to identify issues and establish improvement plans to reduce risk.
Assumed scenario Recognized risks and opportunities Countermeasures 1.5°C and 2°C scenarios • Increasing demands for loans to purchase the low-carbon vehicles and housing that contribute to creating a low carbon society increase profit opportunities • Value of securities issued by companies taking insufficient low- carbon action declines, increasing investment opportunities for companies that contribute to a transition to a low-carbon society • Development of services that take climate change into consideration, such as provision of special interest rates for home loans for environmentally conscious housing • Establishment of a system for ESG investment at Sony Financial Group companies based on Sony Financial Group’s ESG investment policy 4°C scenario • Increase in insurance and benefits payments due to climate change- related disasters such as typhoons and floods, and increase in infectious disease and heat stroke due to rising average temperatures • Increase in credit costs due to the loss of value of security real estate granted to home loans due to the effects of climate changerelated disasters • Impact on operations and increase in costs due to climate change- related disasters affecting our offices and human resources • Begin collecting information on climate change-related disasters, infectious diseases and heat stroke • Continue to utilize reinsurance • Begin collecting information on the impact of climate change- related disasters on security value • Continued consideration of BCP advancement in the event of a natural disaster. 
Note: The above scenario analysis was conducted using IEA’s scenarios for 1.5°C, 2°C and 4°C temperature rise and based on multiple assumptions. Actual events may differ from the scenarios.

Risk Management. 
Each business unit, subsidiary/affiliated company and corporate division of Sony periodically reviews and assesses risks for the area of which it is in charge and works on finding, reporting, reviewing and responding to the risks. In addition, Senior Executives have established and maintain a system to identify and control risks that may cause losses to Sony, in the areas of which they are in charge.
The Corporate Executive Officer in charge of group risk control comprehensively promotes and manages the establishment and maintenance of the systems as stated above through the activities with related departments. The Board of Directors receives regular reports on the framework and its operational status, to confirm the validity of the framework.
Under the framework, each business unit, subsidiary/affiliated company and corporate division also assesses and analyzes climate- related risks, when assembling business strategies and business plans.
Metrics and Targets. 
In 2010, the Sony Group formulated the Road to Zero global environmental plan, which aims to reduce its environmental footprint to zero by 2050. The target year for our goal of achieving carbon neutrality group-wide was moved up from 2050 to 2040 in May 2022.
For climate change action, Sony is developing and supplying environmentally conscious products and services in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions not only from manufacturing at its sites, but also throughout the life cycle of its products. Sony is also making energy-efficiency improvements at its business sites and shifting to renewable energy, while encouraging contract manufacturers and component suppliers to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.
In September 2020, Sony Group Corporation announced its Green. 
Management 2025 medium-term environmental targets to achieve by the end of fiscal year ending on March 31, 2026 and has been implementing initiatives to meet these targets since April 2021. In. 
GM2025, the life cycle of products has been divided into five stages: product/service planning and design, operations, supply chain, logistics, take back and recycling. At each stage, Sony has set specific targets from the four perspectives of climate change, resources, chemical substances, and biodiversity, and implemented initiatives to achieve these targets. Climate change targets include a 5% reduction in annual energy consumption per Sony product (compared to fiscal year 2018). Along with moving up the year to meet our climate change targets, we have also changed the target rate for renewable electricity used in our facilities from 15% or more to 35% or more.
Both our 1.5°C target to be achieved by 2035 and our net zero target to be achieved by 2040 are approved by the Science Based Targets (SBT)* initiative as climate change targets based on scientific grounds.
In the financial sector, we have long made investments and loans in a variety of sustainable bonds, including green bonds. We established the Sony Financial Group ESG Investment Policy in April 2022, and our financial group companies are now proceeding to establish systems for ESG investment in accordance with this policy.
* An international initiative to encourage companies to set science-based greenhouse gas reduction targets in order to limit the increase in the average global temperature due to climate change to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels.

increasing traffic congestion. The national bus company decided to adopt a FeliCa smart card passenger ticketing system in order to encourage the residents of Bangladesh to use municipal buses. The. 
FeliCa based system has made it easier for users to get on and off buses. This added convenience has attracted more riders, which is in turn helping to alleviate traffic congestion.
Supporting Environmental Projects Using Drones. 
The Sony Group’s Aerosense Inc. combines automated flight drones with cloud services to build and provide various industrial solutions.
They enable high-precision drone surveying that helps save labor at civil engineering sites nationwide. This technology is also used for confirmation work in natural disaster response and prevention, bolstering national resilience by allowing damage to be quickly investigated during such events. Safe and efficient inspection and investigation methods that do not require people to travel to the sites are needed as occurrences of natural disasters increase due to abnormal weather. As one such solution, in 2021, Aerosense successfully completed a demonstration test to collectively inspect multiple sand control dams through drones suited to wide flight areas that utilized LTE* communications. This technology enables safe and efficient mountain surveying, paving the way for disaster response and prevention through regular inspections and emergency surveys immediately following a natural disaster.
In 2021, we conducted a demonstration test of logistics by drones in depopulated areas in five projects in coordination with the Ministry of the Environment and the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism.
* LTE: Long Term Evolution. This communication standard is used for mobile wireless communication in smartphones and other cellular phones, and is capable of sending large amounts of data.
Digital Cinema Systems. 
Previous film development required a massive amount of positive film, water and chemicals. To rectify this issue, Sony developed the. 
HDW-F900, the world’s first digital video camera for cinema production, back in the year 2000, and began offering 4K digital cinema projection systems consisting of projectors and other devices in 2007. Since then, we have continued to provide digital cameras to movie production sites and theaters worldwide. These cameras save both resources and power and improve operation efficiency.
Our VENICE Digital Cinema Camera was released in 2018. This camera was both smaller and lighter than conventional models, yet capable of 6K recording. Then, in 2022, we released VENICE 2, which supports internal recording within the camera, making filming systems even small and lighter.
Social Implementation of the Open Energy System™
Sony Computer Science Laboratories, Inc. (Sony CSL) is developing a distributed scalable energy system to promote the introduction of locally produced and consumed renewable energy, as well as the decarbonization of local communities. To this end, the Autonomous. 
Power Interchange System (APIS), a core module of the proprietary microgrid Open Energy System™, was made open source and has been available free of charge since 2020.
In addition to a past demonstration test with the Okinawa Institute of.

*1 Energy-using products which operate the intended main function with energy input from a commercial power supply *2 The BRAVIA CAM accessory automatically detects movement.
*3 Feature will be available via a future firmware update.
*4 In theory, emissions during product use in the current fiscal year should be calculated from the total quantity of electrical power consumed by previously sold Sony products that are still in use by consumers in the current fiscal year.
However, given the difficulty of determining how many previously sold Sony products are still in use by consumers of the total number of Sony products sold to date, Sony uses the total quantity of electrical power consumed while in use over the lifetime of Sony products sold in the current fiscal year as an indicator for CO2 emissions during use.
Reducing the Power Consumption of BRAVIA™
Energy Efficiency of PlayStation® 5. 
Conserving Resources. 
Reducing Resources Used in Products. 
Sony is working to reduce the average mass of products in order to minimize resource inputs. In fiscal year 2021, the total volume of resources used in products* was approximately 436 thousand tons, which was 15% lower than in fiscal year 2018. This is due to continuous efforts to reduce the size and weight of both products and packaging in a wide range of product categories, as well as a decrease in the number of units sold.
* Total volume of resources used is the total weight of resources used in products, accessories, instruction manuals and packaging materials. The weight of total products shipped is used to represent this value.
Using Fewer Resources in Products and Packages. 
Sony is working to make its products and packages even more lightweight and compact across a wide range of product categories in order to conserve resources.

Extending Product Life to Save Resources. 
Sony indirectly reduces resource consumption by extending product life. The Xperia™ Smartphone, released in fiscal year 2021, features unique charging optimization technology that adjusts the amount of charge according to a user’s individual usage habits, and a “careful charging” function that reduces load on the battery during charging.
These features promote long-lasting batteries that don’t deteriorate, even after three years* of use. This allows for a product to be used long-term, reducing battery and product waste.
* Based on a simulation that repeatedly charges and discharges with the same type of battery (for USB charging). Battery life varies by use.
Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions. 
Sony products consume electrical power while used by their owners, resulting in indirect emissions of CO2. Sony has adopted the target of reducing annual energy consumption per product*1 from product use by 5% by fiscal year 2025 compared to the fiscal year 2018 level. Sony sets specific fiscal year targets in every product category and is implementing diverse measures to reduce energy consumption.
Annual energy consumption of products in fiscal year 2021 was up 3.3% compared to 2018. For example, select BRAVIA™ televisions include a sensor*2, *3 that detects user movement to automatically reduce screen brightness, reducing power consumption when no one is in front of the TV. PlayStation®5 incorporates energy efficient features to suspend and resume game play at 0.5 watts or less if activated and uses around 80% less electricity in rest mode compared with the latest models of PS4 and PS4 Pro (on average).
However, due to larger products, higher levels of performance and additional functions, 2021 power consumption Sony-wide increased approximately 3.3% over 2018. Total CO2 emissions in product use over the lifetime of all products sold in fiscal year 2021 were approximately 10.73 million tons, which was 0.9% higher than in fiscal year 2018.*4.

Reducing Use of Virgin Plastics. 
Virgin Plastic Used Per Product. 
With the target of reducing virgin oil-based plastic used per product by 10% from the fiscal year 2018 level, by fiscal year 2025 (excluding packaging), Sony is working to expand its use of recycled plastics and make its product chassis more lightweight and compact while also minimizing plastic packaging. In fiscal year 2021, virgin oil-based plastic used per product was down approximately 3.1% from the fiscal year 2018 level. This is mainly due to the advancement of recycled plastics across a wide range of product categories, such as televisions.
Incorporating Recycled Plastic. 
To reduce the consumption of virgin plastic, Sony has expanded the use of recycled plastics in a broad range of product categories by developing recycled plastics while elevating quality and reducing manufacturing costs.
Sony is using its original recycled plastic SORPLAS™ in the rear cover of select BRAVIA™ televisions. Recycled plastic is now used in some soundbar and headphones models as well.
In fiscal year 2021, the Sony Group used some 21 thousand tons* of recycled plastic in its products. This amount consisted of approximately 37% recycled plastic content from scraps and other waste materials generated from manufacturing by the Sony Group and other companies, and approximately 63% post-consumer recycled plastic content from used products, containers, and other sources.
We have used approximately 134 thousand tons* of recycled plastic from fiscal year 2014 through fiscal year 2021.
* Consumption of recycled plastic is based on the gross value including virgin plastic and additives that are mixed with recycled materials.

SORPLAS™, Sony’s Original Flame-Retardant Recycled Plastic. 
In 2011, Sony began practical use of Sustainable Oriented Recycled. 
Plastic (SORPLAS), a flame-retardant recycled plastic made possible by a proprietary compounding technology that combines an original, non-halogen and non-phosphorus flame retardant—itself produced using a Sony-developed process—and waste plastics (polycarbonate resin) from various sources in an optimal blend. Thanks to Sony’s novel flame-retardant, which makes it possible to impart flame- retardancy by the addition of a very small amount of less than 1% of total content while conventional flame retardants require an addition amount of around 10%, SORPLAS not only surpasses conventional flame retardant plastics in terms of durability, heat resistance and recyclability, but also achieves an outstanding utilization rate of up to 99% waste plastics. The effective utilization of SORPLAS has been shown to reduce CO2 emissions in product manufacturing by up to 80%.* Moreover, Sony’s versatile waste-plastic compounding technology makes it possible to tailor SORPLAS to the needs of a variety of products. Sony first used SORPLAS in its products in 2011 and has since incorporated it into a wide variety of Sony products such as select models of BRAVIA™, Xperia™ Smartphones, compact cameras and camcorders.

Going Paperless. 
Sony is working to reduce paper use across a wide range of its businesses. For our electronics products, we continue to prioritize ease of customer understanding for instruction manuals, while moving online in a variety of product categories to reduce paper use.
We had previously included instructions for multiple languages for overseas models of audio products such as Walkman® or headphones, but have now unified these after-purchase instructions by introducing the Textless Quick Start Guide (QSG), which uses illustrations that users can easily understand regardless of language since 2015. For our LinkBuds, released in 2022, we removed after-purchase paper instructions entirely, instead providing a QR code on the packaging to enable users to use their smartphone to access the online Help. 
Guide. Further, we revised the precautions and specifications that must be provided in paper manuals to reduce paper included in packaging by 85%.* Moving forward, we intend to extend these efforts to additional audio products and further reduce paper usage.
The Sony Financial Group has been reducing the use of paper for contracts and transactions, employing digital technology to both to conserve paper resources and reduce mailing, which produces carbon emissions.

Saving Resources in Promotional Materials. 
Sony is working to reduce resource consumption in products and packaging as well as in shop-front promotional materials. In Japan, make-to-stock has been the main system for promotional material production, but by shifting to build-to-order, only the required number is produced and sent directly to the shopfront. Further, we have adopted a long-life design that can be reused for multiple years, saving resources used for promotional materials.

Managing Chemical Substances. 
Sony’s Proprietary Global Standards for the Management of Chemical Substances. 
Many of Sony’s electronics products contain between a few hundred and a few thousand parts that are made of a variety of chemical substances, some of which may be classified as hazardous and may harm the environment if they are not properly controlled prior to product disposal. To prevent such environmental harm, some countries and regions have introduced laws and directives. In the European. 
Union, certain chemical substances in products are restricted by. 
Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (RoHS) Directive*1 and REACH*2 regulation.
In Japan, products that contain certain chemical substances are required to carry the J-Moss*3 mark, while in China it is required to disclose information on chemical substances contained in products in line with the Management Methods on the Pollution Control of. 
Electronic Information Products, often referred to as China RoHS.*4. 
In light of the global nature of its markets and supply chains, Sony has established its own global standards for the management of chemical substances, titled “Management Regulations for the Environment- related Substances to be Controlled which are Included in Parts and. 
Materials (SS-00259)”,*5 taking into account the related laws and regulations around the world and simultaneously the opinions of various stakeholders. In line with these standards, Sony ensures globally consistent management of chemical substances in parts and materials.
*1 Directive on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electric and electronic products (RoHS).
*2 REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals) is a regulation for managing chemical substances introduced in Europe, whereby companies are required to, among others, register, apply for authorization, notify, restrict and communicate information on certain chemical substances.
*3 J-Moss refers to Japanese Industrial Standards (JIS) for marking the presence of certain chemical substances in electrical and electronic equipment.

By minimizing packaging materials using packaging drop simulation technology, Sony reduced the amount of plastic packaging used for the 4K LCD TV KJ-55X85K, launched in 2022, by approximately 35%.*1. 
Switching to Paper Product Boxes. 
Sony is switching to paper product boxes for a wide range of product categories. In fiscal year 2021, Sony switched to paper product boxes for six headphone models sold in countries and regions around the world. All headphones shipped after 2022 will be in paper boxes. For the Xperia 1 III released in 2021, the film was changed to wear- resistant varnish to enable a package with as little plastic as possible.
Sony has also switched to paper boxes for more than 130 compact camera and camcorder accessories.

suppliers. To assist REACH compliance, Sony has collected information on raw materials listed in Green Book data on the content of certain chemical substances and makes this data available to its suppliers and contract manufacturers.
Management in Quality Control/Quality Assurance Processes. 
New parts and materials are tested to ensure conformity with SS-00259 standards in addition to compliance with conventional quality control standards. Data on the content of certain chemical substances collected from suppliers are thoroughly evaluated for this purpose.
By implementing these strict management procedures worldwide, incompliant products are prevented from entering the market.
Utilization of Chemical Analysis. 
To prevent prohibited substances from accidentally entering products,
Sony requires suppliers to conduct ICP analysis on the specific parts and materials. For some high-risk substances Sony has also implemented internal control systems that involve using, for example, X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and other measurement devices, to Sony sites worldwide, to help confirm that prohibited substances are kept out of products.
Substance Management in Xperia™ Smartphones. 
In the smartphone category, Sony began phasing out brominated flame retardants (BFRs) in circuit boards, casings, and cables starting in 2002, making it one of the first companies in the industry to phase out BFRs.
Since then Sony has continued the journey and phased out BFRs in all parts, and also phased out chlorinated flame retardants (CFRs), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), as well as phthalates, beryllium, and antimony trioxide in plastic and resin. Going forward, Sony will continue phasing out all brominated and chlorinated compounds as well as antimony.
Sony Mobile Critical Substances [PDF:151KB]
Management of Chemical Substances in Packaging Materials. 
Sony takes precautions to increase the safety of its packaging materials and ensure that hazardous substances, including heavy metals, are not mixed into packaging materials by managing materials in line with its proprietary “Management Regulations for Environment- related Substances to be Controlled which are included in Parts and. 
Materials” (SS-00259). The packaging section of SS-00259 is based on, among others, EU directives on packaging and packaging waste.
Complying with Regulations Governing Chemical Substances in Products. 
Sony has set up necessary procedures to ensure compliance with the. 
EU’s REACH regulation requirements and revised RoHS Directive. In response to its obligation under REACH to provide information to customers, as well as to the CE marking requirement of the RoHS directive, Sony has adopted the chemSHERPA*1 scheme based on IEC 62474.*2 This enables Sony to collect data on specified chemical substances in parts and materials purchased from suppliers for management in an internal database.
*1 chemSHERPA is a scheme that facilitates sharing information throughout an entire supply chain on chemical substances that may be used in products.
*2 IEC 62474 is a set of international standards regulating the procedures, content, format and other aspects of reporting within the supply chain regarding the presence of chemical substances and constituent materials in electrical and electronic goods.
Three Core Principles for Managing Chemical Substances in Products. 
To guide its efforts to manage chemical substances in products in compliance with Sony’s own global standards for management of chemical substances, titled “Management Regulations for Environment- related Substances to be Controlled which are included in Parts and. 
Materials” (SS-00259), Sony has established three core principles:
Upstream Management. 
In 2002, Sony established the Green Partner Environmental Quality. 
Approval Program, which outlines Sony’s Green Partner Standards for chemical substance management. Sony audits suppliers based on these standards. Sony purchases electronic parts only from suppliers who have passed this audit and have been certified as Green. 
Partners. Sony also applies the Green Partner Environmental Quality. 
Approval Program to manufacturing partners. To further enhance the efficiency of the system to manage chemical substances, in 2003. 
Sony introduced the Green Book, a raw materials database, which was made available to Sony’s direct suppliers via its electronic supplier portal. In the Green Book, Sony has registered only those materials that it has measured and confirmed compliance with the. 
SS-00259 standards for Sony’s designated raw materials such as recycled plastics and wires, and also for molding resins, paints, inks, and other materials that are commonly used by multiple first tier.

* Parts in which PVC is eliminated are as below (excluding bundled/standalone accessories):
Xperia Smartphones: in all plastic components.
Products other than Xperia Smartphones: in casings and internal wiring.
Examples of Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) -Free Products and Brominated Flame Retardant (BFR) -Free Products. 
Brominated Flame Retardants (BFRs)
Some BFRs are harmful to human health and tend to remain in the environment and accumulate in living organisms. As is the case with. 
PVC, improper incineration of BFRs carries a risk of releasing harmful substances into the environment. Sony has banned the use of components and materials containing any of three specified BFRs — polybrominated diphenyl ethers, polybrominated biphenyls, or hexabromocyclododecanes — and is working to phase out BFRs (the adoption of which is subject to the resolution of issues relating to quality, technology, and supply).
Also, Sony is working to use Sony developed environmentally sound, bromine-free flame retardant for the manufacture of a polycarbonate plastic flame retardant in some product categories such as LCD TV.
As of the end of July 2022, Sony has replaced BFRs in new products and new models in the following products with alternative substances.
Reduction and Replacement of Chemical Substances of Very High Concern. 
Sony defines “Environment-related Substances to be Controlled” (hereafter “Controlled Substances”) as certain chemicals that it has determined to have significant impact on both humans and the global environment, including substances that may not be controlled by laws (please refer to Management Regulations for Environment-related. 
Substances to be controlled which are Included in Parts and Materials (SS-00259)). Sony either prohibits the use of these substances in parts or phases them out wherever a viable alternative that meets all product quality and technical requirements is available. In addition,
Sony specifies high-risk applications from collected application- and content-related information, considering the hazardous nature and extent of exposure (volume) as risk factors, and proceeds to prohibit the “Controlled Substances” in the specified use.
Management Regulations for Environment-related Substances to be controlled which are Included in Parts and Materials (SS-00259)
Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC)
Improper disposal of PVCs poses a risk of generating hazardous substances. For example, Sony is concerned about the possibility that its small electronic products, in particular, could be collected to obtain valuable materials, and then the unwanted parts could be improperly incinerated and disposed of in landfills, thus causing adverse environmental impacts. In addition, there are also concerns about the environmental and health impact of some of the substances used as plasticizers and stabilizers in PVCs. Although. 
PVCs are not currently regulated by any laws that apply to chemical substances used in electronic products, Sony works to reduce PVC content in individual components.
As a result, Sony does not use PVCs in product packaging materials (with the exception of some packing materials for devices, semiconductors, batteries, and similar items) or in sheets/laminates used for product housings, contactless IC cards, and carrying bags/ cases for products (excluding those for professional use).
Sony has also successfully replaced PVCs by substitute materials for internal components that are difficult to remove prior to recycling, such as flexible flat cables, insulation plates, and heat-shrink tubes (excluding those for batteries). Also, Sony is working to end the use.

Examples of Environmental Features in Sony Products. 
Sony is working on environmentally conscious and recycling-friendly designs and is improving environmental performance in terms of energy and resource conservation in a wide range of product categories. Signature products for these efforts are introduced on. 
Sony Group Portal Website “Environment.”
Sony Group Portal Website “Environment”
Designing Recyclability and Reparability into Products. 
One initiative Sony is taking to ensure that its products are environmentally conscious involves designing them with recyclability and reparability in mind. This means, for example, labeling the material type of plastic used in parts to make it easier to extract resources from used products during recycling, and reducing the number of screws to make it easier to dismantle and repair the product.
These specific environmental considerations are compiled and incorporated into the design of each product. For example, Sony has issued Environmental Design Standards and Guidelines for TVs and. 
Serviceability Standards, which are used when planning and designing new products, and monitors progress on meeting these standards. These design standards and guidelines reflect the trends in regulations inside and outside of Japan as well as Sony’s medium- term environmental targets. Sony conducts an annual review and revision of these guidelines based on industry trends and the latest recycling information, which is gathered via regular sharing of information and opinions with the Green Cycle Corporation, an affiliate of Sony engaged in the recycling business. Additionally, in order to ensure compliance with the laws and regulations regarding circular economy in Europe, Sony provides information on repair and disassembly of the display products such as TVs and commercial monitors on the support page of the website for repair shops and recyclers, and provides dealers and retailers with reparability index information for TV and smartphone products sold in France.
Creating Environmentally Conscious Products. 
Promoting Environmentally Conscious Design. 
Sony has set medium-term environmental targets for products, including reducing annual power consumption, promoting resource conservation and managing chemical substances. Business units set areas of focus based on Sony medium-term environmental targets and targets based on the specific characteristics of the environmental impact throughout the lifecycle of targeted product categories.
In the course of product design, environmental targets are set for each product according to business unit targets and feedback about previous models to execute an environmentally conscious design.
Environmental assessments are conducted and progress toward these targets is reviewed before mass-production of a product begins. Business units receive feedback on the results of this review, conduct their own review of progress with their medium-term environmental targets for each product, and report results to the department in charge of environmental functions at headquarters.
In turn, this department evaluates the targets and progress of each business unit and conducts an overall review of the Sony Group’s progress on achieving its medium-term environmental targets. Based on the results of this review, Sony determines areas of focus for the subsequent fiscal year. This method enables Sony to execute ongoing environmentally conscious processes for the department in charge of environmental functions at headquarters, as well as each business unit and product, which in turn ensure the development of environmentally conscious products.

Utilizing Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)
Product life cycle assessment (LCA) is a means of identifying and quantifying the environmental impact of products at all stages of their life cycles, which include the manufacture of materials and parts used in products, the assembly and transport of products, product use and standby mode, and end of life (i.e., disposal and recycling).
LCA of major products helps us to clarify priorities for product improvement for all product categories and reduce the environmental impact of Sony products.
As shown in the graph to the right titled “Breakdown of CO2 Emissions. 
Over the Life Cycle of Signature Sony Products,” we see that the life cycle stages responsible for generating a large portion of a product’s. 
CO2 emissions differ depending on the product category. For example, for product categories such as LCD televisions, and Blu-ray Disc™*/
DVD players, emissions during product use account for a large proportion of total emissions. For this reason, reducing the power consumption of these products during use is particularly important.
Conversely, among product categories such as smartphones and interchangeable lens camera α™, a large portion of CO2 emissions occur in the production of materials and parts, rather than during use. For these products, such measures as reducing product weight are crucial in lowering life cycle CO2 emissions. LCA results are reflected in medium-term environmental targets and utilized in product design for the environment.

Promoting Green Purchasing. 
Having set internal standards for green purchasing, Sony chooses environmentally conscious products when procuring nonproduction materials such as printing paper, stationery and office equipment in. 
Japan. At the same time, in principle, Sony carefully examines needs, amounts to be used and stock levels to purchase appropriate quantities. In addition, when choosing products to be purchased,
Sony prioritizes select recommended products in consideration of environmental impact at all stages of a product’s life, from resource extraction through to production, distribution, use and disposal.
Information on recommended products is included in Sony’s purchasing system of nonproduction materials, making it possible for individuals in charge of purchasing decisions to give priority to environmentally conscious products.
Reducing Environmental Impact Across the Supply Chain. 
Working with Material and Component Suppliers and Outsourcing Contractors to Reduce the Impact on the Environment. 
As a part of its efforts to reduce environmental impact across the supply chain, we request that our materials and components suppliers and subcontractors handle both greenhouse gas and water depletion issues. For GHG emissions, Sony requests them to monitor emission levels, set medium- and long-term targets for emissions reduction and perform progress management. For water depletion,
Sony requests them to set targets for water consumption reduction in consideration of water depletion risk in the areas where the site is located. Sony conducts surveys on efforts to reduce environmental burden in order to understand the impact greenhouse gas emissions and water consumption, etc., by sites have on manufacturing materials, components and products, delivered to Sony.
In fiscal year 2021, Sony obtained answers about a variety of data from materials and components suppliers which account for approximately 80% of the total transaction value and from subcontractors which account for approximately 90% of the total transaction value. We encourage accurate calculation of GHG emissions for suppliers for whom this information cannot be calculated.
Our 1.5°C Science Based Target (SBT) stipulates materials and components suppliers and subcontractors will set SBT-consistent reduction targets equivalent to 10% of supply chain GHG emissions by fiscal year 2025. To this end, Sony provides SBT guidance during surveys to them and supports target setting and certification acquisition of SBT-consistent targets for some suppliers.
With regard to chemical substances, Sony requires its materials and components suppliers and subcontractors to comply with laws and regulations in each country restricting or banning the use of chemical substances in materials, components, semi-finished goods and.

emissions from fuel used by Sony-owned business vehicles. In fiscal year 2021, CO2 emissions resulting from fuel used in vehicles amounted to approximately 8,000 tons.
Going forward, Sony will take efforts to restrict greenhouse gas emissions through infrastructure-related measures, including the installation of high-efficiency equipment and the promotion of energy recycling, and to enhance nonstructural measures, notably the introduction of training programs designed to foster energy- saving leaders.
Emissions of PFCs and Other Greenhouse Gases. 
PFCs and other greenhouse gases with high global warming potential are used in cleaning and etching processes during the manufacturing of semiconductors. Emissions of PFCs and other greenhouse gases in fiscal year 2021 (calculated in terms of CO2) totaled approximately 105,000 tons, up about 7,000 tons from fiscal year 2020. Introduction of PFC abatement equipment and other reduction initiatives have been carried out, but total emissions increased due to the growth in semiconductor device production.
Promoting Efficient Energy Use. 
To achieve its fiscal year 2025 reduction targets, Sony is working on various energy conservation activities at its sites around the world. A sample of these initiatives follows.
High Efficiency Energy Systems for Factories. 
Sony Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation’s Nagasaki Technology. 
Center (Nagasaki TEC) aimed to be the most energy efficient factory in the semiconductor industry upon construction of the Fab 5 building. In the refrigerators and boilers that control the temperature and humidity of clean rooms used for semiconductor manufacturing, AI is utilized, and advanced control technology operates the refrigerators at minimum power, while another system reuses the production equipment exhaust heat to power the boiler. These innovations improved clean room energy efficiency by approximately 30% compared to fiscal year 2015.
Sony Device Technology (Thailand) Co., Ltd (SDT). installed an energy- efficient air conditioning system when it reconstructed its clean room for semiconductor production. The system requires less airflow than conventional air-conditioning systems to keep the work area clean, enabling it to reduce its annual CO2 emissions by approximately 2,700 tons, a 67% reduction compared to the previous system.
Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions. 
Greenhouse Gas Emissions at Sony Sites:
With the target of reducing absolute greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from Sony sites by 5% relative to fiscal year 2020 levels by fiscal year 2025, Sony has endeavored to reduce greenhouse gases such as CO2 and perfluorocarbons (PFC) related to energy consumption. In fiscal year 2021, the total volume of GHG at manufacturing sites was approximately 1.20 million tons, which was approximately 8% higher than in fiscal year 2020. Although measures have been taken to reduce. 
GHG emissions, such as promoting energy saving and expanding the use of renewable energy at Sony sites, the total amount has increased due increased rates of GHG emissions at some power utilities.

Energy Conservation: Initiatives Driven by Plant Employees. 
Sony promotes a broad range of energy-saving efforts at its sites around the world. In addition to increasing the energy efficiency of buildings and equipment, in recent years Sony has actively implemented activities for reducing energy consumption suggested by manufacturing site employees. These activities focus on the formulation and implementation of energy-saving solutions for manufacturing sites, which consume more electricity than any other part of Sony’s manufacturing operations. Employees set ambitious project targets and take steps to shed light on energy consumed in different manufacturing processes. This enables employees to identify unnecessary uses of energy in such processes, as well as to develop and test solutions and, having confirmed the effectiveness thereof, to effect ongoing improvements. Particularly outstanding solutions are subsequently expanded to other sites.
These activities were prompted by the effectiveness of the Eco. 
Challenge Project implemented in 2009 at Sony Group Corporation’s. 
Sendai Technology Center and Sony Storage Media Manufacturing. 
Corporation’s Tagajo site. Similar energy conservation activities are now being implemented at Sony manufacturing sites around the world.
Using AI-Based Data Analysis to Improve Heat Source System Efficiency. 
Sony’s headquarters building is using CALC™, a suite of technologies developed by Sony Computer Science Laboratories that uses AI to analyze large-scale data sets. The tool is being used to improve energy efficiency by analyzing data from the building’s heat source system and identifying factors that increase efficiency. CALC uses proprietary methods and algorithms that merge statistical and physics theory with technologies to precisely analyze observational data and deduce hidden factors. Sony’s headquarters building utilizes sewage heat energy supplied from the nearby Shibaura. 
Water Reclamation Center for its HVAC systems, which significantly reduces electricity consumption. Using CALC revealed the potential to improve the operation of sewage waste heat pumps, which led to adjustments in the operational controls and the realization of further energy savings.

Key Procurement Policy. 
Evaluate environmental impact when introducing or operating power generation equipment, taking care to prevent adverse effects on the environment.
Examples of Environmentally Conscious Items: • Land stability (outflow of earth or equipment due to slope collapse, etc.) • Noise generated from power conditioners, etc. • Impact of reflected solar panel light on living environment • Impact on landscape • Impact on animals, plants and ecosystems • Check laws and regulations, and communicate with the local community during off-premises installation.
• Hydroelectric power generation must be 30 MW or less. • Carry a sense of forward movement to promote proliferation of new renewable energy power generation as much as possible.
• Choose a renewable energy power source that already exists in the country or region of the site.
RE100 Membership. 
In 2018, Sony joined RE100,* a global initiative to use 100% renewable energy, in addition to internally set targets. Our goal of working toward sourcing 100% renewable electricity was originally 2040, but was moved up to 2030 in May 2022.
Use of Renewable Energy. 
Use of Renewable Energy and Renewable Electricity Rate. 
Sony’s original goal to use renewable energy* (renewable electricity rate) for 15% or more of the electricity used in operations at business sites by fiscal year 2025 was updated to 35% or more by 2025 in May 2022. Sony is working to adopt renewable energy in ways suited to the regional circumstances of its business locations worldwide, employing strategies such as installing solar power systems in site buildings, procuring renewable energy from power utilities, and utilizing renewable energy certificates. In fiscal year 2021, 35,668MWh renewable electricity was used, which is approximately 14.6%.
* Renewable energy includes solar, wind, water, geothermal, and biomass. This is energy that comes from sustainable sources.
Renewable Energy Procurement Policy. 
Sony has always considered the surrounding environment when introducing renewable energy, so we have updated our procurement policy with additional environmentally conscious items for the introduction and operation of power generation equipment.
* RE100 is a global initiative led by the non-profit The Climate Group in partnership with CDP in which participating companies set a goal of procuring 100% renewable electricity for power used in their global business operations.
Sony accelerates target to achieve a zero environmental footprint by ten years. 
Regional Initiatives. 
Even before joining RE100, Sony had been taking action on renewable energy at sites around the world. It has already achieved 100% use of renewable energy in many regions. In fiscal year 2008, it was one of the first enterprises in Europe to make the switch to 100% renewable energy for the electricity consumed at its sites. Since then, it has achieved 100% use of renewable energy in China (in fiscal year 2020) and in the Pan Asia region (in fiscal year 2021). This success in the. 
Pan Asia region is due to the installation of solar power systems at its sites and the active use of renewable energy certificates. Sony is systematically increasing the amount of renewable energy it sources in North America, with the aim of achieving 100% in fiscal year 2030.
Similar introduction through a variety of initiatives is underway in.

Management of Industrial Waste. 
Sony takes precautions to ensure waste from its sites is not inappropriately disposed of. For example, in Japan Sony has set consistent internal standards for selecting waste disposal contractors and inspecting disposal sites on an ongoing basis. It has also established an internal system of accreditation for disposal site inspectors, and is stepping up efforts to minimize risks associated with contracting out waste disposal. To reinforce this system, Sony implements periodic on-site inspections in the waste disposal contractors, thereby ensuring rigorous management procedures.
Example of Waste Reduction. 
Sony is reducing waste at all its business sites. Sony Semiconductor. 
Manufacturing Corporation changed the flocculant used in the treatment of wastewater generated from production machinery to a biobased polymer flocculant that offers improved setting and flocculating performance. This led to a reduction of sludge, which accounts for the majority of waste. This led to a reduction of both conventional primary flocculant (inorganic flocculant) and inorganic flocculant-derived sludge. Sludge was further reduced by processing excess sludge in a dehydrator. These, in addition to other measures, have reduced waste by about 1,300 tons annually.
In 2021, the Kagoshima Technology Center, in cooperation with a subcontractor company, recycled sludge from on premises into a block to create a flowerbed. A signboard describes this recycled block, giving customers and locals an opportunity to learn about environmental activities while also raising the awareness of people on premises.
Reducing Waste Generation. 
Amount of Waste Generated at Sites. 
With the target of reducing waste amount intensity value from Sony sites by 5% relative to fiscal year 2020 levels by fiscal year 2025, Sony has implemented a variety of measures to reduce waste and use resources more effectively. In fiscal year 2021, waste intensity value at. 
Sony business sites worsened approximately 7.6% compared to fiscal year 2020. Sites generated approximately 52,000 tons of waste, which is up approximately 0.5% from fiscal year 2020. Although Sony is promoting reduction by continuously improving production site processes and reducing waste generated, the volume of waste increased, mainly due to the expansion of semiconductor factories and increased production. Furthermore, about 7,000 tons of industrial waste generated was plastic waste.
Improving Component Packaging. 
At all of its sites, Sony works to reduce the amount of waste through overall reviews of the packaging used in components and the optimization of this packaging. For example, a range of measures are employed to reduce the amount of materials used in component packaging materials and hence curb the amount of waste. These include the complete elimination of protective bags for components, modifications to increase the capacity of containers used to store components, and the switch from disposable containers to multi-use returnable boxes. In particular, Sony is working to standardize the sizes of, and materials used in, returnable containers while aiming to expand the range of items for which such containers are used.

Available water resources vary greatly in terms of quantity and quality, depending upon the region. In manufacturing, it is necessary to consider water resources from the perspective of securing enough water for production while maintaining good stakeholder relations.
Sony uses water risk assessment tools provided by the World. 
Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) to perform water risk assessments for the regions where Sony sites are located. Sony is working with local stakeholders to ensure proper use of water by promoting activities that reflect the water risks in each region.
Proper Water Management to Protect the Local Environment. 
Water Usage and Risk at Sony Sites. 
Water is a constantly circulating and unevenly distributed resource, which makes water issues very regional in nature. To tackle this issue,
Sony set the goals of improving water usage intensity value on sites that use high volumes of water by 5% relative to fiscal year 2020 and implementing risk reduction measures at sites located in water risk areas. In fiscal year 2021, water usage intensity value at sites worsened approximately 1.7% relative to fiscal year 2020. Water usage was approximately 19.55 million m3, an increase of 4.5% relative to fiscal year 2020. Sony is making efforts to recycle water and save water on production sites, but the amount of water used has increased, mainly due to the expansion of semiconductor factories and increased production.
Sony also takes steps to ensure the quality of wastewater at its sites.
In addition to observing related laws and regulations in each of the countries and territories in which it operates, Sony manages wastewater quality criteria further than is required. For example, the introduction of sophisticated water treatment facilities has enabled it to reduce BOD and COD levels* in wastewater.

Increasing Semiconductor Production while Reducing Water Usage. 
Sony Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (SCK) is working toward reducing the amount of water it uses for the semiconductor production while increasing the production capacities. Nagasaki. 
Technology Center is working to reuse wastewater from gas detoxifying equipment used in the semiconductor manufacturing process, and is reusing about 80% of the wastewater.
Kumamoto Technology Center (Kumamoto TEC) is aiming to reduce water used for combustion treatment to remove exhaust gas emitted from the semiconductor production lines. To do this, they have enhanced the equipment to increase the proportion of recycled water, thereby lowering the amount of fresh water needed by about 50%. In addition, in order to help preserve the abundant aquifer in the Kumamoto region, Kumamoto TEC has for many years been conducting “groundwater recharge” efforts. This involves flooding fields with river water that slowly permeates into the water table during times before planting or when no crops are being grown. In fiscal year 2021, approximately 3.09 million m3 water intake was recharged, a volume that exceeds that used by Kumamoto TEC.

Managing Chemical Substances. 
The Sony Group has developed a group-wide approach to the management of chemical substances used at sites where the use of these chemicals is controlled by legislation, designated as having a potentially harmful impact on the environment, or used in large quantities.
Reinforcing Standards for Managing Chemical Substances. 
Sony categorizes chemical substances into four classes and carefully manages and reduces the amounts s of these chemical substances used, as well as the amount transferred as air, water, or soil emissions and waste. In countries where no legal reporting requirements exist for chemical management, Sony sites apply standards based on. 
Japan’s Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (PRTR) as internal rules. Chemical substances are classified as follows:
Reducing Water Usage in Various Ways. 
Green Cycle Corporation, an affiliate of Sony that engages in the recycling of home appliances, began harvesting rainwater in fiscal year 2014. The rainwater undergoes rigorous quality tests before being used in recycling processes that involve crushing machines, etc. Via measures such as turning the entire 2,500 m2 rooftop of Plant. 
No. 2 into a rainwater collection area, Green Cycle Corporation was able to harvest 1,429.9 m3 of rainwater in fiscal year 2021, which covered 40% of the plant’s total water usage.
The Sony headquarters building uses treated wastewater to cool its heating equipment. By using water treated at the nearby Shibaura. 
Water Reclamation Center to cool heating equipment, the amount of clean water normally used to replenish the water in the cooling towers has been reduced by approximately 30,000 m3 per year.
Sony Technology (Thailand) Chonburi Plant (STT-C) focuses on wastewater recycling as a means to reduce tap water usage. It has installed an on-site wastewater treatment plant to supply make-up water to air-conditioning cooling towers, which normally use large amounts of tap water. By using recycled water for the cooling towers,
STT-C reduced its tap water consumption in fiscal year 2021 by 29,475 m3.
Efforts to Reduce VOC Emissions to Air.

Environmental Risk Management at Sony Sites. 
To carry out effective risk management of chemical substances and emergency responses, the Sony Group has enacted the Sony Group. 
Standards for Site Environmental Risk Management, which set the management standard and give examples of improvement measures.
Based on these standards, at each site Sony has implemented accident prevention measures, including prohibiting the burial of tanks for chemical substances and pipes, and various leak prevention measures. In addition, Sony rigorously works to prevent environmental accidents through ongoing improvements to its systems based on regular audits at each site, information sharing among sites and other initiatives. Sony has established a system whereby its sites are required to promptly report environmental accidents to the authorities and to take appropriate countermeasures. No such accidents were reported at any of Sony’s sites in fiscal year 2021.
Response to Soil and Groundwater Contamination. 
In the event that an incident of soil or groundwater contamination is identified at a Sony site in a voluntary check or other assessment, remediation processes are implemented in compliance with pertinent local laws and ordinances. For example, Sony Group companies in. 
Japan deal with the occurrence of contamination of soil and groundwater at Group sites by taking steps in line with the Sony. 
Group Standard for Assessing Soil and Groundwater, an internal. 
Example of Reduction in Chemical Substance Usage. 
Sony Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (SCK) collaborated with an equipment manufacturer to develop a proprietary volatile organic compound (VOC) treatment system as part of efforts to reduce the amount of VOCs released. Conventional VOC treatment systems are installed near ventilation duct outlets. Since such equipment is designed to treat extremely rarefied organic substances, it is very large, making space and cost constraints an issue for semiconductor plants that want to install these types of systems. SCK responded by focusing on production equipment for highly concentrated organic substance and developed a small, fixed condensing-type VOC treatment system in conjunction with an equipment manufacturer. The newly developed system can be installed near production equipment and is able to treat VOCs efficiently.
Incidents of soil and groundwater contamination resulting from operations have been confirmed at Sony Group sites as follows. In response, Sony has been remediating the contamination and submitting regular reports to authorities. Sony Semiconductor. 
Manufacturing Corporation’s Nagasaki Technology Center completed the treatment of contaminated soil in a 613.3 m2 area that had been designated as an area requiring notification of character change to land, and the designation was lifted on June 25, 2021.
Ozone-Depleting Substances. 
Sony succeeded in completely eliminating first-generation chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) from its manufacturing processes in 1993 and banned the use of second-generation hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) at the end of fiscal year 2000. Sony business sites currently prohibit the use of ozone depleting substances stipulated under the. 
Montreal Protocol. Sony uses CFCs as a refrigerant in some air- conditioning units only. Compliance with laws and regulations in each country is ensured, and strict care is taken to prevent leakage of. 
CFCs from these units during maintenance.
Small, fixed, condensing-type VOC treatment system developed by SCK in conjunction with an equipment manufacturer. 
Phase 1. 
Investigate past and present chemical use and confirm the existence or otherwise of used or unused underground tanks, buried piping, other similar equipment, or previous incidents, at the site. Perform an inspection of the site to ascertain whether there is any residual soil or groundwater contamination.
Phase 2. 
Based on the investigations undertaken in Phase 1, carry out an assessment of the areas that are potentially contaminated. Undertake measurements at these locations in line with the Soil Contamination Countermeasures Act.
Phase 3 If any contamination is identified based on these results, carry out prevention and remediation procedures.

Since its inception in 1972, the Kohda Site of Sony Global. 
Manufacturing & Operations Corporation, a producer of products such as digital still cameras, has protected a natural woodland on its site, naming it Sony Forest. Sony Forest was designated as a wildlife sanctuary* (Kohda Northern Wildlife Sanctuary, Aichi Prefecture,
Japan), and is vital to the neighboring ecosystem. Owls are at the top of the ecosystem pyramid, so in order to build a rich ecosystem inhabited by them, we continue activities at the Kohda Site such as building spaces for owls to fly and feed, as well as installing nest boxes. As a result of these efforts, inhabitation of endangered owls has been confirmed every year since 2016.
Monitoring Survey of the Recovering Gamo Tidal Flats. 
Sony Group Corporation’s Sendai Technology Center (Sendai TEC) and Sony Storage Media Manufacturing Corporation’s Tagajo site are conducting a biological monitoring survey of the Gamo Tidal Flats (Sendai City, Miyagi Prefecture, Japan), which is about 4 km from the manufacturing site. The Gamo Tidal Flats were damaged by the tsunami caused by the Great East Japan Earthquake, devastating the surrounding pine forest and reed fields, leading to a critical situation for the area’s flora and fauna. This rich natural area was originally inhabited by a variety of worms and gobies, is a breeding ground for little terns and Kentish plovers, and is also the wintering ground for the brant goose, a natural monument of Japan, and has been designated as a national wildlife sanctuary special protection area.
Since 2014, Sendai TEC and the Tagajo Site have been tracking the recovery of the Gamo Tidal Flats in collaboration with the Gamo. 
Conservation Society environmental NGO. A decade has passed since the earthquake, and the environment of the Gamo Tidal Flats continues to recover. A 2020 survey confirmed 12 species of benthic life including sand blubber crabs, 21 species of birds including the red-necked stint and other plovers and sandpipers, 11 species of plants including okahijiki and hamanigana, and 4 species of insects including earwigs. Three rare species, osprey and dunlin (birds) and herbaceous seepweed (salt-tolerant plant) were also observed.

Reducing the Environmental Impact of Logistics. 
Promoting Modal Shift. 
As a part of its efforts to reduce environmental impact from the transport of finished goods, Sony promotes modal shift, switching the modes of transport it uses from air to sea and from truck to railroad.
Modal Shift for Tape Media. 
From fiscal year 2020, Sony Storage Media Solutions Corporation switched from air to sea transport for storage tape media that is manufactured in Japan and destined for distribution centers in the. 
US, Belgium, and Singapore. The modal shift led to a reduction of approximately 905 tons of CO2 emissions in fiscal year 2021 compared to the previous fiscal year.
CO2 Emissions from Transport of Finished Products. 
With the target of reducing absolute CO2 emissions related to logistics between nations and within regions by 10% (compared with fiscal year 2018) by fiscal year 2025, Sony has worked to reduce transport weight by making products and packaging smaller and lighter, while optimizing transportation efficiency and switching to transportation methods that have a low impact on the environment.
In fiscal year 2021, the total CO2 emissions from product transport (international and regional*) was approximately 191 thousand tons, an increase of 5% over fiscal year 2018. This was the result to restrictions on production and international transportation due to the. 
COVID-19 pandemic.
* Some countries and regions are excluded from “intraregional transportation.”
Logistics particular, such as BRAVIA™ TVs, Sony proactively uses railroad for long-distance (500km or more) domestic transport. Recognizing these efforts, since 2011, Sony has been certified by the Japanese. 
Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism as a certified company in the “Eco Rail Mark” system, while BRAVIA TVs have earned product certification.
Sony also promotes domestic sea transport. In fiscal year 2021, CO2 emissions attributable to the transport of products in Japan were approximately 231 tons lower than would have been the case if products had been transported by truck.

Recycling Law requires consumers to pay collection, transport and recycling fees when disposing of applicable home appliances, retailers to take back such appliances and return them to manufacturers, and manufacturers to recycle these appliances.
Sony has established a nationwide cooperative recycling network with four other manufacturers. As a consequence, Sony-manufactured televisions are now recycled at 15 recycling plants across Japan. At these recycling plants, TVs are manually disassembled, and the parts are crushed and sorted using various equipment.
Materials such as iron, copper, aluminum, and plastic are then separated out and sold to businesses that produce raw materials, making them available for reuse. In addition, certain harmful substances such as lead and mercury found in some older products and parts are removed and disposed of properly in accordance with the law.
Recycling Activities in Europe. 
Take-back legislation in Europe—in particular, the European Union (EU) Directives on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE),*1 Batteries*2 and Packaging*3—requires manufacturers to organize and finance the collection and recycling of end-of-life products and packaging.
Sony takes full responsibility for its take-back obligations in all applicable European countries. With the aim of building a recycling market where the principle of competition works in Europe, Sony formed the European Recycling Platform (ERP) in cooperation with other companies in 2002, building efficient and cost-effective systems for the collection and recycling of end-of-life products that enable member companies to fulfill their obligations as manufacturers.
Sony continuously strives to find the best recycling partners.
*1 Directive 2012/19/EU on waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) *2 Directive 2006/66/EC on batteries and accumulators and waste batteries and accumulators *3 Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste. 
Sony’s Recycling Compliance Systems. 
Sony utilizes authorized collection schemes for the collection and recycling of WEEE, batteries and packaging across Europe. These conduct regular on-site audits of all contracted recyclers to ensure compliance and prevent illegal shipments outside the EU. Sony engages authorized partners that undertake recycling on behalf of manufacturers to ensure our products are recycled in a compliant manner, in accordance with European Directives and country specific regulations.
In 2021, Sony financed the costs of recycling approximately 41,253 tons* of end-of-life products and packaging in Europe. In collaboration with other manufacturers, Sony discloses relevant information on components that require special treatment for product categories placed on the market in Europe for recyclers to facilitate safe recycling.
* End-of-life products and packaging in fiscal year 2021 does not include certain countries, such as France.

Korea: “ART” (Action Really Together) Campaign. 
In Korea, the recycling law has been in place since 2003 and covers electronics, battery as well as packaging. Sony Korea has been working with related associations to collect the specific volume assigned by the government annually. In addition, to educate and encourage employees and local community to play their parts in e-waste recycling, Sony Korea has initiated the ‘Zero Waste. 
Campaign’ in Korea since 2012. This initiative has since been extended to Sony Group companies, neighbors and friends of Sony employees as well as other organizations. Hence, the campaign was renamed “Action Really Together (ART)” in 2016 to emphasize the importance of taking actions together for a good cause, regardless of brands. Besides collecting end-of-life products for recycling, Sony. 
Korea also collects unwanted used products in good working condition and donates them to a local NGO.

Management of Risks Related to Chemical Substances. 
As a company that uses chemical substances, Sony discloses information on emissions of such substances and exchanges views on safety and environmental issues with residents in the vicinity of its sites, as well as with local authorities, with the aim of reinforcing mutual understanding.
For instance, Sony Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation actively participates in local community events and organizes its own interactive events at all of its plants. The company also holds tours of its manufacturing plants, during which it explains to visitors how wastewater is processed by environmental-related equipment.
Stakeholder Engagement. 
Sony is active in a wide range of fields, and its stakeholders have diverse expectations. In order to promote a healthy, spiritually abundant, sustainable society, Sony is deeply committed to stakeholder engagement, a process whereby it seeks to earn greater trust from stakeholders and cooperate with them to achieve common aims.
Partnership and Participation in Multi-Stakeholder Frameworks. 
Consumer-Focused Environmental Communication. 
Sony promotes Environmental Communication to share environmental information with consumers through the official website, video sharing sites and social media. We introduced our group-wide environmental targets and environmental features of new products in some of the product announcement videos released in fiscal year 2021. This kind of Environmental Communication enabled us to reach more consumers with this information.
Furthermore, Sony China displayed camera lenses at regional Sony stores along with a video that showcased resource conservation efforts in products, which resonated with many of our customers.

Materiality Rationale. 
Since its establishment, Sony has sought to remain at the forefront of technological development, building continuously on its achievements to deliver new value for people everywhere. In these efforts, Sony recognizes the people who work at Sony to be its most important management resources. Employees are important stakeholders in. 
Sony’s diversified, global business and are the key to its efforts to achieve sustainable growth and generate social value. Sony is committed to increasing employee engagement by making the most of the individual strength, skills, abilities, and creativity of its diverse people. Sony seeks to sustainably elevate its talent and organizational capabilities in order to raise its overall business performance.
Basic Approach. 
Since its founding, Sony has viewed employees not as a group, but as individuals. Sony respects the independence of each individual and their enthusiasm for taking on challenges and cherishes a corporate culture that places the company and employees on equal terms, based on the partnership of choice between Sony and each individual employee, where each party is accountable for being responsive to the needs of the other. With the recent launch of Sony’s new organizational structure, Sony’s People Philosophy— unchanged since the beginning —is now described with the phrase, “Special You,
Diverse Sony.” Accordingly, Sony’s HR strategy framework is organized around the themes of “Attract talented individuals,” “Develop talented individuals,” and “Engage talented individuals.” Sony seeks to maximize the value that each of its diversely talented employees can create, thereby driving the Sony Group’s sustainable value creation.
System. 
Material issues related to employees are discussed and deliberated at group-level meetings and by HR committees for each business segment. The Sony Group Corporation officer in charge of human resources and HR managers from the six Sony business segments also hold regular meetings.
The Diversity Committee reports directly to the CEO about diversity, equity & inclusion, and Sony also has structures in place for employees to get consultation on a broad range of issues including human rights issues, human rights risks, work-life balance, and LGBTQ+ concerns.
Looking to the Future. 
With a focus on diversity, equity & inclusion, talent development, and engagement, Sony Group will continue to offer working conditions that contribute to the health and safety of employees as part of its efforts to achieve sustainable growth and generate social value. Sony will provide opportunities for employees to improve and make the most of their individual strength, skills, abilities, and creativity.

Highlight. 
Some of the Main Initiatives Aligned with Sony’s HR Strategy. 
Attract Talented Individuals: Opening Up New Fields for Persons with Disabilities (Financial Services)
Sony Life and its special-purpose subsidiary Sony Life. 
Business Partners (SLBP) promote inclusivity and offer environments where employees with disabilities can “be themselves” in their work.
SLBP was established by Sony Life as a special-purpose subsidiary in March 2019. Sony Life was expanding its regular workforce, and recognized the need to hire persons with disabilities and expand the fields in which they could confidently play an active role. In addition to clerical and cleaning work, it started to provide work that involved collecting used stationery to be recycled and reused. Sony. 
Life aims to provide a place where persons with mental, developmental or intellectual disabilities can find independence and autonomy, and can contribute to society through high-quality work.
Develop Talented Individuals: Positive Influence (Music)
Positive Influence is the first talent and inclusion program to be run at Sony Music Entertainment (SME). By opening up paths into the music industry, it has continued to really change things for young people from lower socio-economic communities.
Employees receive specialized coaching from the Creative. 
Mentor Network, a charity that has partnered with SME, so that they can have a positive impact on the communities concerned, on SME, and on the creative industry as a whole.
The Positive Influence program enables employees to play an active role in those communities, share their knowledge of the music industry with young people from lower socio- economic communities, and facilitate opportunities for them.
Simultaneously the program has added value to Sony’s internal culture by helping to support the development of its employees and create a deeper understanding amongst its workforce of the systemic issues faced by young people trying to break into the industry, encouraging them to become advocates for change and actively champion diverse talent.
Engage Talented Individuals: SIE Heroes 2021 (Game & Network Service)
SIE Heroes 2021 is a peer-to-peer recognition program that celebrates and recognizes the efforts of SIE colleagues from across the globe. The program was started in 2020, which was a challenging year for SIE with the pandemic and the launch of a new console. It was the first significant employee engagement activity since SIE moved to a global model.
In 2021, there were 6,000 nominations (an 82% increase from the previous year) in four categories, Work/Project,
Emotional Support, Unsung Hero, or Something Else. The leadership team is invested in this project, sending personal notes to employees who received the highest number of nominations. Nominations are displayed on an in-house website with the prior approval of the parties concerned. This program surfaces thousands of organic stories of employees demonstrating positive cultural behaviors and has helped SIE to continue fostering a culture of recognition and support.

Sony’s People Philosophy. 
Sony’s People Philosophy: Special You, Diverse Sony. 
This has been redefined in line with the new organizational structure established in 2021. The phrase “Special You” describes an independent individual who shapes their own career with a spirit of freedom and open-mindedness and opens up the future. “Diverse Sony” represents. 
Sony’s culture, which values diversity and supports each employee’s individual strength, thoughts, dreams, and the challenges they are excited about. “Special You, Diverse Sony” conveys the message that each unique individual and Sony itself, which embraces the individual, can grow together, aligned by our shared Purpose.
Since its founding, Sony has respected the independence and aspirational spirit of individuals, always cherishing a corporate culture based on the partnership of choice between Sony and each individual employee, where each party is accountable for being responsive to the needs of the other. This is the essence of Sony’s. 
Founding Prospectus, written in 1946 by co-founder Masaru Ibuka, which reads, “We shall establish an ideal factory that stresses a spirit of freedom and open-mindedness, and where engineers with sincere motivation can exercise their technological skills to the highest level,” and “We shall place emphasis on a person’s ability, performance and character, so that each individual can fully exercise his or her abilities and skills.” It is also reflected in the words that fellow co-founder,
Akio Morita, spoke to newly hired Sony employees: “If you regret joining Sony, quit immediately. Once you’ve decided to work for. 
Sony, let us be responsible to each other. I’d like every one of you to think at the end of your life that you have no regret spending time at. 
Sony.” A positive growth cycle by which the growth of diverse individuals propels Sony’s growth is possible because the company and the employees stand together on equal terms, with an overarching expectancy to mutually deliver and scale up, as Sony continues to provide employees with a range of growth opportunities so they can willingly take on their best career options.
The group-wide HR strategy is based on Sony’s People Philosophy and is organized around the themes of “Attract talented individuals,” “Develop talented individuals,” and “Engage talented individuals.”
Attract talented individuals: Sony approaches a broad range of talent via recruitment campaigns across the Group, attracting diverse people who identify with the Sony Purpose, embrace a challenging spirit and possess ambition to grow. Develop talented individuals:
Sony provides employees with a diverse range of spaces and opportunities for autonomous learning and has systems in place that make various career challenges available to them. Engage talented individuals: Sony boosts employee engagement and creates relationships where organizations and employees help each other to develop and grow. Because each of the Sony Group’s diverse businesses requires various management styles and talent with different skills and abilities to create value, each business plans and executes a HR strategy that best suits its needs, while operating in line with the shared People Philosophy. Rather than managing each individual business, Sony Group Corporation leads and supports the evolution of each Sony business, while focusing on common themes that will drive sustainable growth for the entire group.

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. 
Sony Group Diversity Statement. 
Sony, which develops diverse businesses globally, employs employees with diverse backgrounds. Sony leverages its diverse businesses and workforce as strengths in its business strategy. The. 
Sony Group Diversity Statement was established in 2013 to serve as a global policy to further highlight the importance of diversity in the workplace. Sony’s People Philosophy establishes that Sony is a “place” that supports and realizes the growth of independent “individuals” and will grow together to fulfill the Sony Purpose &
Values. Accordingly, Sony values the perspective of equity and strives to ensure true inclusion. Sony regards diversity, equity and inclusion as a key management concern and will continue to maximize its performance in this area.
Sony Group Diversity Statement. 
It is in Sony’s DNA — and a source of our innovation — to value different perspectives and backgrounds as we conduct our business activities globally and rise to new challenges. Sony promotes diversity across the Sony Group as a key management strategy by ensuring an inclusive work environment and by recruiting, hiring, training and promoting employees from diverse backgrounds.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. 
Business and Geographies. 
Cross-Business Collaboration. 
Sony is engaged in a broad range of businesses, and its diverse employees collaborate across them to take on new challenges in the development of products, services and content, and marketing. In fiscal year 2021, a total of 3,400 Sony Group employees were transferred to other companies within the Group to enable them to branch out in their careers and build cross-business connections, and this is creating new opportunities for collaboration around the Group.
Employees Activities Across Regions. 
As of March 31, 2022, approximately 960 employees were transferred overseas as part of Sony’s global deployment of personnel, to transfer technology and knowledge, and launch new businesses. This includes some 80 employees dispatched from group companies outside of Japan, working in various business fields, approx. 50% of whom are in management positions. The Sony Group operates job transfer policies to efficiently facilitate international transfers. In fiscal year 2021, the global COVID-19 pandemic continued to be a major impediment to personnel transfers. In response to this, Sony took a flexible approach while carefully assessing the situation in line with restrictions and regulations on international entry.
To better support employees of all nationalities and languages, the. 
Sony Group in Japan follows up on employees after hiring and assists employees in their networking and career development. To facilitate. 
English communication among employees from around the world, intranet content and systems for personnel and accounting are offered in both English and Japanese. Sony also shares government information related to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as about border controls and vaccinations, and provides comprehensive support with the practicalities of daily life.

Sony* (Diversity Initiative for Value Innovation at Sony), Sony Group companies in Japan have conducted surveys and interviews with non-Japanese employees, their managers and colleagues. Using these results, those companies have identified issues they face and are working on devising and implementing necessary measures.
Specifically, Sony provides opportunities for non-Japanese employees to explore their own career development and gain insights, and implements ongoing initiatives to foster a culture that respects diversity. These initiatives include Sony Happy Hour, a regular networking event for non-Japanese employees, interviews with non-Japanese management personnel who serve as role models, cross-cultural communication events, and talks on diversity by globally known outside speakers.
* DIVI@Sony stands for Diversity Initiative for Value Innovation at Sony.

The goal of the lecture was to encourage the audience to take individual action aimed at gender equality. Feedback from top management included the comment, “We need to create a corporate culture and workplace environment where women can develop their career.” The event was a clear reminder of how mindsets are being changed.
China. 
To coincide with Diversity Week 2021, Sony China held online workshops on topics such as “how to find happiness at work and in life,” “what defines an inclusive workplace,” and “unconscious bias.” It also held an offline campaign called “Diversity Blossoms” which offered many opportunities to think about diversity, equity and inclusion.
United States. 
Sony Music Publishing held a management workshop on unconscious bias. Inclusivity is essential when managing a diverse workforce. Participants in the workshop could see how they, just like everyone else, have unconscious biases and learned how important it is to look at things from diverse angles.

Promoting Greater Opportunities for Individuals with Disabilities. 
Sony employs and supports individuals with disabilities in compliance with the laws, regulations, and rules of the countries and regions in which it operates, while endeavoring to create inclusive working environments that enable employees to build successful careers regardless of any disabilities they may have.
Sony co-founder Masaru Ibuka once recalled the day when an initiative was launched, saying, “We had a spirit of autonomy and a belief in creating workplaces that do not offer charity, but rather create an environment that makes it possible for individuals with disabilities to manufacture products that exceed those manufactured by individuals without disabilities.*1” Sony’s senior management has been seeking to build an environment in which individuals do not feel held back by their disability and disabilities do not create barriers, enabling everyone to thrive.
Sony Taiyo Corporation, which was established in 1978 prior to the legal institution in Japan of special-purpose subsidiaries, has begun to share throughout the Sony Group the know-how and experience it has amassed on the employment of persons with disabilities. Sony develop leadership skills and mindsets among women and support their networking, by providing opportunities for career development and assisting the professional growth of women. In March 2022, Sony invited an expert to give a lecture in celebration of International. 
Women’s Day. The event was intended to provide a deeper understanding of global trends and to encourage the audience to take action aimed at gender equality.

Key Activities to Promote Career Development of Individuals with. 
Disabilities at the Sony Group around the World. 
Global. 
Sony was selected as one of the Iconic Companies in The Valuable 500, an international initiative to promote participation by individuals with disabilities so that they can demonstrate their latent potential to bring value to business, society, and the economy. The Iconic Companies are a driving force in their respective countries, regions, and industries. Sony is providing support for The Valuable 500 Media Hub Project.
Japan. 
The Sony Group in Japan is creating inclusive workplace environments where a disability is no impediment to building a career, and is working with employees with disabilities to check building accessibility and make improvements where necessary. Ten Sony Group companies participated in the annual job fair, which was held online with company information sessions and individual interviews taking place on the same day, and was an opportunity for job seekers with disabilities to engage with Sony Group companies. As the only company in Japan selected by The Valuable 500 as one of its Iconic Companies, Sony is discussing initiatives with affiliated companies in Japan and The Nippon Foundation Library to create a society where people with disabilities can flourish.
United States. 
Sony Corporation of America works with partners such as Disability:IN, a global organization devoted to inclusion and equity for persons with disabilities in business, to provide training and educational opportunities to support employees with disabilities.
China. 
Sony China goes beyond simply providing employment opportunities for people with disabilities; it endeavors to promote the hiring of people with disabilities via a diversity and inclusion program that supports practical courses which help university students with disabilities adapt to their future life as a working adult.
has created an inclusive environment at its three special-purpose subsidiaries: Sony Taiyo Corporation, Sony Kibou/Hikari Corporation which specializes in providing employment opportunities for individuals with intellectual and mental disabilities, and Sony Life. 
Business Partners Co., Ltd. which was established in 2019 to carry out clerical work and other tasks for Sony Life. Sony is now expanding initiatives to create an inclusive environment throughout the group.
Sony Group special-purpose subsidiaries are independent business establishments that seek to provide job satisfaction via carefully thought out employment, such as duties carried out jointly with other business sites or individual companies. These initiatives are leveraged in the employment of persons with disabilities at each group company.
Guidance is provided to prepare suitable work environments and raise employee awareness so that everyone can flourish at work wherever they are, and to increase workplace knowledge about disability employment and expand job opportunities in individual companies. Amongst other steps, Sony prepared group-wide guidelines on reasonable workplace accommodations, prior to legislative changes introduced in Japan in 2016. These guidelines ensure that sufficient discussions take place with individual employees who have a disability prior to making such accommodations.
Group companies outside Japan also employ persons with disabilities in partnership with national and local government agencies or as allowed by local circumstances, and in some cases have received external recognition for employment of persons with disabilities or have been cited as examples for other companies to follow. Sony provides opportunities for learning about special-purpose subsidiaries in Japan and approaches to employing persons with disabilities, as well as avenues for companies to share expertise. By employing persons with disabilities in a way that only Sony can, Sony is practicing the approach of co-founder Masaru Ibuka both locally and globally.
In December 2019, Sony became a signatory of The Valuable 500, an initiative of the World Economic Forum that focuses on the inclusion of persons with disabilities. Sony has been selected as one of the. 
Iconic Companies among the 500 signatories, and is providing support for the Media Hub*2 project.
In addition to employing persons with disabilities and giving consideration to the accessibility of products and services, Sony aims to lead the inclusion of persons with disabilities throughout the global community, linking its efforts to spread the sentiments of Sony’s founders and expand its corporate initiatives to Sony’s intrinsic value.
LGBTQ+ Inclusivity. 
Sony globally strives to provide LGBTQ+*1 employees with working environments in which they can feel comfortable being themselves, striving to be a leader whilst acknowledging various national and regional considerations and circumstances.
In Japan, Sony has expanded certain personnel programs*2 to encompass same-sex partners and implements an e-learning course for all employees that covers LGBTQ+ issues, while also offering. 
LGBTQ+ workshops.
Sony also supports the diversity of employees in other ways, such as enabling employees to use their preferred names at work, providing multipurpose restrooms, using gender-neutral uniforms, making it optional for job applicants to indicate their gender on applications, and providing private toilet and shower facilities in each room at corporate dormitories.
In addition, Sony organizes internal and external events designed to raise awareness on working environments that are comfortable for everyone.
In recent years, Sony has also been focusing on the impact that the presence of allies who understand LGBTQ+ issues and offer active support has on the psychological safety and willingness to work of. 
LGBTQ+ employees. It is making efforts to increase the numbers and visibility of such allies in its workforce, and held joint events with companies in other businesses to explore this topic in fiscal year 2021.
*1 LGBTQ+ is an acronym for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or questioning, and others. The expression is broadly used to refer to persons who do not identify as straight (heterosexual) or cisgender (identifying with the gender assigned at birth).
*2 Personnel programs that have been extended to same-sex partners include monetary gifts and leave for bereavement, rent subsidies, and participation in employee family events.
Employees with disabilities accounted for 2.87% of Sony Group. 
Corporation’s workforce as of March 31, 2022, while the average for the Sony Group in Japan (companies with over 101 employees, consolidated basis) was 2.50% as of March 31, 2022, both above the 2.3% mandated by Japanese law for companies over a certain size.

LGBTQ+ Initiatives by the Sony Group around the World. 
Japan. 
Sony organizes talks on LGBTQ+ issues for employees and the public online, making them easier to attend for employees from other business sites and staff in charge of diversity at other companies. In addition to expanding opportunities for employees of the Sony Group in Japan to learn about LGBTQ+ issues, this has made the Sony Group’s stance known to the wider public. Sony has also co-hosted events with other companies to increase the number of employees who are LGBTQ+ allies. Sony sponsored and was involved in Diversity Career Forum, an event organized by the NPO ReBit. Through the forum, Sony was able to broadly highlight its LGBTQ+ and diversity initiatives to the public. Sony received the highest Gold rating in the PRIDE Index from the volunteer organization work with Pride (wwP), in recognition of its internal and external efforts to promote understanding of LGBTQ+ issues.
United States. 
In the United States, Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc., Sony Corporation of America, Sony Interactive Entertainment Inc. and Sony Electronics all achieved the maximum score of 100% based on assessments in the Corporate Equality Index from the Human Rights Campaign Foundation, recognizing them as companies that create ideal working environments for LGBTQ+ employees. These scores reflect the level of fairness achieved within the organization toward LGBTQ+ employees, which is underpinned by rules designed to support these employees. Sony holds training on LGBTQ+ inclusion in partnership with the LGBTQ+ media advocacy organization GLAAD, and is also an official sponsor of the 33rd Annual GLAAD Media Awards, which honor media for fair, accurate, and inclusive representations of LGBTQ+ people and issues.

Talent Development. 
Career Development. 
Sony has always encouraged its employees to take on new challenges, fostering this mindset both to further the growth of its employees and its growth as a company.
Back in 1966, Sony became the first Japanese company to launch an internal job posting program, which has now been in place for 56 years. The program provides an avenue for employees to explore career opportunities while serving to optimize the assignment of personnel and strengthen key parts of Sony’s business. To date, more than 7,900 employees have moved to new positions via the program, which has become essential to Sony’s personnel strategy of developing employees who are eager to take on new challenges.
In fiscal year 2015, Sony introduced Career Plus, a program that enables employees to remain in their current positions while also being involved in other jobs and projects posted by the company by holding concurrent or secondary positions. The program enables personnel to broadly leverage their expertise and knowledge while also building up their networks within Sony.
Moreover, in order to ensure that career development is focused on the individual, Sony has greatly expanded its existing open recruitment system, adding new programs to it. These include a free agent program that gives talented employees the ability to declare their availability to Sony Group companies, which provides them with greater opportunities to branch out and pursue job opportunities in new fields, and Sony CAREER LINK, a program in which employees who register a profile can be contacted by a specific workplace or human resources department when a position matching their skills and experience becomes available.
Every autumn, Sony offers employees opportunities to network and explore new avenues in its Career Month, when it holds lectures and workshops to encourage employees to be more proactive about their career and provides career counseling. Employees also meet directly with their supervisors to discuss development plans regarding their careers and growth, and to review their skills. They receive support in autonomously shaping their career path in a way that is appropriate to their current career stage. Sony seeks to support employees’ growth through work experience, and the New Performance. 
Management Program used at Sony Group companies was revised in fiscal year 2016 to better reflect individual observations and foster growth. The program not only enables employees to set individual goals and track their progress, but also encourages year-round communication with their superiors by incorporating feedback on such aspects as their everyday conduct and impact on their workplace.
Sony is pursuing its purpose of “fill the world with emotion, through the power of creativity and technology” by encouraging its employees to take on new challenges and supporting their career development by giving them professional experience within the Sony Group.

Sony strives to further enhance motivation and encourage personal growth for its employees through on-the- job learning, as well as through access to a variety of programs designed to enhance individual abilities and skills and tailored to local needs.

Accordingly, Sony is implementing initiatives aimed at fostering such employees and creating even more opportunities to bring their capabilities into full play.

Sony is also strengthening its overall management using leadership development and coaching strategies at its overseas bases and in its businesses.
In addition to mandatory training, Sony supports employee-driven development. It offers seminars, courses at outside institutions, and a growing range of online courses to fit the needs of employees, and has also expanded individualized study opportunities by opening a learning platform for group companies in Japan in 2021. Sony is creating an environment that makes employees aware of their own career path and individual growth. To be more specific, it is doing this via recommended content based on an employee database of individual skills and so on, an approach that delivers the learning an employee needs when they need it, and the visual representation of the employee’s learning trajectory. Sony is also working on content collaboration with overseas group companies via the platform.
Overseas group companies also run their own initiatives, and have provided personalized learning content based on the situation of each employee. In addition, programs to acquire the skills needed to produce high-quality output in a changing work environment have been provided in Japan and overseas. For example, Sony Corporation of America runs sessions where experts talk about working successfully in a hybrid environment, and provides tools and resources to support employees in transitioning to a hybrid environment.

PORT— An Ideal Venue to Develop New Talent. 
Sony recognizes the importance of fostering a culture and nurturing an environment in which the group’s diverse businesses and the diverse employees who drive those businesses can learn from each other and continue to grow. PORT is a place where ambitious employees who hold diverse values — people from various specialized fields and backgrounds — can organically interact across business and geographic boundaries.
It embodies this concept by providing a venue for employees of the. 
Sony Group to gather, connect, and create synergies in order to grow as individuals and nurture human resources who can navigate Sony into the future. PORT holds a large number of spontaneous employee-led lectures, study sessions, workshops, and brainstorming sessions. In fiscal year 2021, more than 1,000 events, mainly online, were held, bringing in more than 54,000 participants over the year. There is a wide range of content, including lectures by employees to explore Sony’s diverse businesses in depth, round- table discussions where employees share their work-related experiences and thoughts on their job, lectures to get people to think about their career, groups to discuss work styles in remote environments, AI-related workshops, lectures on career development, and discussions of topical books.
Sony provides active support so that employees can keep these activities going. PORT supports the creation of learning communities, facilitates lateral connections amongst employees actively engaged in initiatives, and provides a venue where know-how can be shared.
It directly supports more than 20 communities, and regular study group meetings are held more than 700 times a year.
PORT Shinagawa and PORT Minato Mirai provide environments geared to online PORT activities. With the support of dedicated staff and access to Sony cameras and equipment, employees can record and stream training sessions and learning activities and create their own content.
These efforts enable employees of the Sony Group working in different countries and regions to stay connected despite geographical limitations and continue to create voluntary learning opportunities.
Career support for Senior Employees. 
In today’s era of extended longevity, work and life planning are not uniform, and each individual has different needs and values. Sony has deployed the Career Canvas Program for veteran and senior employees to encourage them to think about, design and implement their own life plans while working actively within Sony. In line with. 
Sony’s founding philosophy of “building one’s own career,” we offer a variety of programs, including workshops on career development and financial assistance, to help employees relearn how to keep developing themselves.
Engineering Talent. 
To pursue its purpose of “fill the world with emotion, through the power of creativity and technology,” Sony must engage in innovation to win new customers. Technology vitally underpins the value creation which drives all Sony Group businesses, so Sony constantly seeks to get even closer to people, to understand their motivations, and to pursue “technology that inspires emotion.”
Using Field-Specific Technology Strategy Committees to Achieve Inter-Organizational Collaboration. 
Sony aims to create long-term social value, in addition to generating sustainable, strong revenues. In order to create sustainable value and continue growing, Sony must leverage the diversity of its businesses and employees to further evolve. Lively interaction among employees from different backgrounds who hold diverse values leads to their own continual growth and ultimately drives the growth of. 
Sony. Technology strategy committees are given the role of sharing knowledge from various fields across organizations, systematically advancing the technologies, and promoting the growth of human resources. The committees are highly significant in Sony’s efforts to create sustainable value and secure ongoing growth.

Technology Training Courses. 
At the Sony Group in Japan, approximately 300 Sony engineers with frontline expertise in key technological fields serve as instructors, developing curricula and textbooks for use in core technology training courses and contributing to the enhancement of engineer expertise. These courses, which serve as the foundation for gaining further technical skills, have been in continuous development since the 1980s. Employees with a high level of expertise in a specific technical field serve as leaders who plan courses with selected themes that are in demand based on the latest conditions in specific fields and Sony goals. The courses are used by employees to expand their knowledge of specialized subjects, brush up on their knowledge for application in other areas, or re-learn subjects.
Sony develops the basic skills of its new recruits by offering them general technological training designed by its leading engineering experts, as well as specialized training programs developed by each of Sony’s business units, which are designed to familiarize the trainees with technologies specific to each business.
In fiscal year 2021, 90% of all training was held online and the AI and cloud-related educational content was enhanced. As a result of these efforts, a total of 26,100 employees took part in these courses, which are the cornerstone of the Sony Group’s training for engineers, and will continue to be provided as opportunities for professional development.
Engineers are provided with various opportunities to gain advanced knowledge in related fields and foster their ongoing professional development by participating in sponsored courses, seminars given by outside experts, and employee open houses.
Sony Outstanding Engineer Award. 
Created to further inspire engineers to take on new challenges, the. 
Sony Outstanding Engineer Award is the highest form of individual recognition for engineers of the Sony Group. In order to develop products and services that appeal to customers’ sensibilities, there is a wide range of technologies that Sony will have to work on. In addition to elemental technologies, there is also a need to integrate creative new technologies, and to optimize complex systems. Intended to increase the motivation of engineers, such awards have encouraged employees to be proactive in addressing challenges and have also promoted a corporate culture that emphasizes value creation.
Corporate Distinguished Engineer Program. 
Based on Sony’s Purpose, the Corporate Distinguished Engineer program is designed to accelerate formulation and implementation of technology strategies that support sustainable growth and the development of talent. The term Distinguished Engineer (DE) designates those engineers group-wide who possess outstanding expertise and technical knowledge in key technological fields and are capable of carrying out the DE mission, shown below. The program highlights the important role that the DEs play as “the faces of Sony technology” who take the lead in formulating technology strategies and supporting talent development. Publicizing this program within the company and in society at large demonstrates this awareness and legacy at a group-wide level.
The Distinguished Engineer’s Mission. 
The DE is to formulate and execute technology strategies while identifying signals of change, and support the development of talent in order to ensure Sony’s sustainable growth. The DE: • Formulates the technological strategies that underpin our Sony’s corporate strategy beyond the existing frameworks • Supports the execution of corporate strategies through technology by building global network and identifying signs of change • Discovers engineers with high potential and supports their development. 
Sony Technology Exchange Fair. 
The annual Sony Technology Exchange Fair (STEF) provides an opportunity for engineers of the Sony Group to present their R&D work to colleagues and create new value by sharing information and ideas among more employees. In addition to providing a space to present technologies of the Sony Group’s businesses, STEF also seeks to enhance expertise and knowledge, featuring lectures and seminars by invited speakers from inside and outside the group, panel sessions chaired by a DE, and the Open Innovation Showcase featuring exhibits by companies receiving investment from the Sony. 
Innovation Fund. The event has served as a launchpad for numerous business applications since it was first organized in 1973. With “Kando-Creating Technology” as its theme, STEF was held as a hybrid format with a mix of online and on-site venues in fiscal year 2021.
More than 15,000 Sony Group employees worldwide participated in the event. COVID-19 measures were in place at the on-site venue, and the mood of the engineers was buoyant as the exhibitors and visitors interacted in person for the first time in two years. There was a live stream from the on-site venue in Tokyo for employees around the world who could not make it in person, creating a sense of unity between all the venues. 48 online seminars were also held featuring guests and DEs who play a prominent role in their field. Sony is a creative entertainment company with a solid foundation of technology, and STEF is a key corporate event that brings employees together and creates the potential for collaborations throughout the. 
Sony Group. STEF is intended to generate technologies that will underpin the Sony of the future.

This program has achieved real business results through experimentation.
Movie. 
To support the development of top talent, Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc. facilitates four programs intended to build leadership and industry acumen at key stages in an employee’s career. The Business of Entertainment 101 program provides an overview of the entertainment business to emerging leaders to develop their business acumen. The Business of Entertainment 201 program provides a deep-dive into industry trends and research, to stimulate new ideas and deepen collaborative relationships between leaders across the company.

There is an on-demand portal site that supports leaders to continue their professional growth, and effective team building tools are also provided.
Entertainment, Technology & Services. 
Sony Corporation provides a wide range of learning opportunities for young employees to study proactively in diverse settings and boost their potential to flourish professionally. These opportunities include practical work in solving future organizational challenges from the perspective of a manager, and sessions on business imagination and leadership development, whose aim is for software engineers to create and drive new business. Some departments already run management training for section leaders that is based on dialog with the employees working under them, and are running a program on sustainable management methodology that brings out the initiative and creativity of diverse employees working from home. The results of employee engagement surveys and stress checks are utilized to gain an understanding of concerns and challenges so that reforms can be accelerated.
Imaging & Sensing Solutions. 
As part of its strategies to nurture the next-generation of leaders, Sony Semiconductor Solutions runs a Core Personnel Training Mini MBA for management. The one-year program provides an overview of “management” and “business,”and the aim is for the participants to comprehensively examine the organization, update the role that they as leaders should play within it, and expand their horizons. After completing the course, they draft a medium-term plan that converts challenges in their own organization which came up in group discussions into solutions for the SSS Group. They present their mediumterm plan to top management, which ensures that they do not simply acquire information but are also motivated to modify their behavior. In addition, to help them develop specific strategies to assist middle management, they carry out surveys of all SSS section managers (around 500 people) to gain an understanding of the true state of management affairs and identify challenges.
Leadership and Future Leaders. 
Sony provides opportunities for professional growth across the Sony. 
Group by leveraging the comprehensive capabilities of its diverse businesses to ensure that it continues to nurture future leaders.
Sony University was established in 2000 with the mission to “cultivate talent who can create and lead management visions and strategies,” to “pass on the Sony Spirit,” and to “create a human network for group management.” Under this mission, Sony University programs are designed to foster top management candidates and global leaders who will play key roles in driving the business forward.
The courses offered include a program for leading managers from different Sony organizations around the world to foster innovative thinking and polish their leadership skills. Managers from Sony group companies who show promise as potential business leaders are selected to participate in a half-year program focusing on management literacy and interpersonal skills. Lively interactions with people from different business units and organizations, and opportunities to learn from each other, give Sony University an atmosphere of friendly rivalry.
The course for global general managers was extended and made more widely available in fiscal year 2021. Participants drawn from. 
Sony Group companies worldwide engaged in group discussions and dialogue with members of the management teams of various business segments, endeavoring to improve their skills and mindsets in areas such as leadership and vision. There was a dialogue session with CEO. 
Kenichiro Yoshida where participants representing each business unit gave presentations on initiatives based on the theme of “getting closer to people.” Their presentations were followed by an active exchange of opinions in which the other participants also joined.
In the courses for general managers and leaders in Japan, selected teams submitted suggestions to the top management about new initiatives and policies Sony should tackle. Lively discussions ensued with CEO Kenichiro Yoshida, CFO Hiroki Totoki and other executives, including those in charge of Sony’s business segments.
Regular talent reviews in each business segment and lateral group- wide opportunities for professional growth serve to maximize knowledge of other business segments, expand personal networks and support synergies between business segments. Having a robust talent pipeline also helps Sony to formulate systematic business succession plans.

Employee Engagement. 
Sony implements diverse structural, environmental, and cultural initiatives, so that employees can constantly challenge themselves to create value.
Work-Life Balance and Well-Being. 
Sony believes that strong revenues are sustained by providing a worker-friendly environment where all employees can perform to their full potential. Under this vision, Sony considers employee health and work-life balance as essential to creating innovation and sustaining strong revenues as a company. Sony offers flexible working provisions and work conditions for employees to realize this work-life balance, while adhering to the customs and laws in countries and regions where it does business.
Each employee of the Sony Group plays a part in the sustainable growth of the company. As part of its commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion, Sony has an important responsibility to create inclusive workplaces with attractive working conditions, and to encourage ways of working that enable employees to make the most of their talents while balancing their work responsibilities with events in their personal lives, including parenting, nursing care, and medical treatment. Sony recognizes the need to accommodate diverse ways of working to secure the health and motivation of employees.
Sony’s workstyle reform project was launched at group companies in. 
Japan in 2017. It endeavors to further raise awareness of existing initiatives such as a day for leaving work at the prescribed time and ensuring employees take advantage of such schemes, as well as encouraging employees to take their annual paid leave.
In Japan, Sony has introduced a flex-time system, a discretionary working system, and an advanced professional system which enable employees to have versatile work options. Last year, Sony Group. 
Corporation employees used an average 14.8 days of paid leave, and employees of the Sony Group in Japan used an average 13.2 days, which is higher than the general average.
Main Work-Life Balance Initiatives at Sony Group Companies around the World. 
Game & Network Services (Global)
Sony offers online therapy, fitness classes, and free telemedicine services. The promotion of work-life balance also includes the Reset Friday initiative to allow all employees to concentrate on their work every Friday afternoon without being interrupted by meetings.
Music (Europe)
Efforts have included a talk by a psychologist on work-life balance and by a psychiatrist on the effects of exercise on the brain and stress levels.
Movie (United States)
Sony has introduced a leave system to accommodate changes throughout the various stages of life, including leave to deal with medical treatments for employees and their families. Sony also offers health-related programs, referrals to physicians, and benefits related to employee family support.
Entertainment, Technology & Services (Japan)
Some Sony Group companies provide services for employees who are raising children or planning to become parents, such as private spaces for nursing mothers, emergency childcare services, and daycare facilities. Other childcare support activities include creating communities where parents can share information on education and other child-related topics.
Flexible Work Options for Diverse Lifestyles. 
The Sony Group in Japan offers human resources programs that enable employees to make the most of their talents within their preferred lifestyles.
Sony Group Corporation has a flexible career leave program, which has been in place since 2015 and is designed to open up a wider range of career paths. It enables employees to take up to five years off to pursue studies or work on upgrading their language or communication skills, or when accompanying a spouse who has been assigned abroad or embarks on international studies, or to take up to two years off to pursue studies at their own expense to further develop their expertise.
The company has a flexible work policy, which broadened the scope of its former telework policy in 2018 by making all employees eligible and expanding the number of telecommuting days available to employees. As a special measure to prevent the spread of COVID-19, the maximum limit on full telecommuting days that employees can take under the flexible work policy has been eliminated, and since. 
June 2020 the core hours that were part of the flextime policy have been abolished. These changes were made to prioritize the health and safety of employees by mitigating the risk of COVID-19 transmission and creating an environment that allows for more flexible and efficient work styles. Even under these circumstances,
Sony’s efforts are unchanged to expand programs to provide employees with flexible and efficient work options, with the aims of enhancing the business efficiency of its organizations, fostering an organizational culture that generates ideas, and increasing the productivity and output of each employee.

Promoting Work-Life Balance. 
In addition to establishing programs that promote work-life balance, the Sony Group in Japan strives to create a corporate culture in which employees seeking to balance the demands of childcare (or nursing care) and work can build careers. Sony conducts seminars for employees who will be taking childcare leave. At these seminars, employees gain knowledge and information that will be useful during their leave, review their career so far, and start career planning for their return. Follow-up seminars are offered to those employees after returning to work. Both seminars are also attended by the employee’s managers. Sony also conducts seminars to encourage men in the workforce to take parental leave by providing them with information on the various provisions available to them, including paid and unpaid leave, as part of the company’s goal to foster environments that make it easier to balance work and childcare. The seminar enables participants to hear about the experiences of other men who have taken parental leave.
Starting in 2018, Sony established a tie-up with a daycare provider to assist employees of Sony group companies in Japan who find it difficult to secure a daycare for their children and return to work. The tie-up enables the use of corporate-led daycare facilities* throughout. 
Japan. To meet the needs of the growing number of family caregivers,
Sony also conducted seminars and lectures on strategies for balancing nursing and work, while providing essential information about nursing.
Through these initiatives, Sony is helping employees to continue developing their careers while balancing it with parenting and nursing.
* Under amendments to Japan’s Child and Child Care Support Act, which came into effect in April 2016, the Cabinet Office of Japan introduced provisions to allow for corporate-led daycare facilities in an effort to address shortages of places and long waiting lists for daycare facilities, so that parents can work. The provisions enable corporations to organize the establishment and operation of daycare facilities. 
Organizational Culture and Communication. 
Communication. 
Sony values employee communication. Embracing a corporate culture that promotes the spirit of freedom and open-mindedness passed down since its founding, Sony fosters diverse forms of communication both within workplaces and across organizational boundaries in order to create value.
Communication between Top Management and Employees. 
Sony treats communication between top management, including the. 
CEO, and employees as a priority. Through the corporate intranet, information is provided on progress made in the Group’s businesses, and communications are exchanged via e-mail and other media.
Sony also works to create many other opportunities for direct dialogue between top management and employees. For example,

Supporting Employees Balancing Work with Child Care, Nursing Care, and/or Medical Treatment.

The plan is designed to help Sony employees achieve work-life balance by creating an environment in which they can make the most of their skills at all stages of their career and throughout the various events in their lives.
Under the Symphony Plan, the Sony Group in Japan has various support programs including childcare paid leave (up to 20 days), which can be used in conjunction with childcare leave, a childcare and nursing care leave grant, which enables employees to take leave without having to worry about finances, and “life vacations” and “accumulated leave”, which can be used for the purposes of childcare, fertility treatment, nursing care, and medical treatment (cancer).

Communication among Employees. 
Sony is exploring new avenues for fostering even more active communication. Sony Group companies in the picture business and the entertainment, technology & services business operating in North. 
America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region have adopted a system that allows employees to recognize and give accolades to peers for their contributions.
Sony employees are voluntarily creating various communities across business and organizational boundaries, which serve as platforms for information exchange, learning, and idea creation. Sony Corporation is utilizing We Project, a bottom-up initiative designed to ferment corporate culture, to hold opinion polls about corporate culture and build communities on the in-house SNS.
Sony actively supports these communities by providing venues and platforms, providing endorsement from the management team, and asking management to be involved in planning various activities.
Labor Unions.

management, but the views of employees can also be used to enhance the quality of management.
Employee Engagement Survey. 
Sony implements a single employee engagement survey across all of its businesses worldwide to collect information that is used to increase the engagement of each employee and energize the organizations. The survey gathers and analyzes information on key factors for continuously improving employee engagement such as employees’ trust in the company and attitudes about value creation, work efficiency and effectiveness, work environment, career, growth and, as of 2021, employee wellbeing indices. The survey results are used to identify areas for further improvement and effective action.
Even though the survey was carried out during the prolonged global. 
COVID-19 pandemic, the number of people who felt they had a chance of building a career in the Sony Group increased, and the engagement index remained favorable for the second year running.
The survey results were used as the basis for detailed analyses of each business segment and senior management discussions on effective action. The improvement initiatives were shared with employees via the corporate intranet and general meetings, with periodic review of results to monitor progress. The survey results were disclosed to managers on the day of the survey to facilitate discussions with employees on improvements that can be made with regard to issues for each organization based on the results and comments from staff who provided them. Sony makes the most of these employee surveys to shed light on employee engagement and promptly incorporates results into ongoing discussion and action across its organizations.

Activities of the Sony HQ OHS Office. 
Monitoring. 
To achieve the Vision Zero goals, the HQ OHS Office regularly collects information on the occurrence of occupational accidents and illnesses at Sony Group companies and sites, and information on the OHS activities carried out there. To collect information, Sony holds regular meetings with regional safety officers to share examples of good practices and events in the region, and this information is used in problem solving. Regional conferences are hosted by safety officers and attended by representatives from sites in the region to gather opinions from individual workplaces and share about any issues. In addition to regularly including information on good practices collected by the HQ OHS Office in in-house newsletters, each time a significant incident occurs or information on an accident comes to light, the office also instructs that actions be taken to prevent a recurrence.
Global Audit System. 
At Sony’s sites, internal audits, corporate audits and external audits are employed to examine the effectiveness of OHS management systems.
Internal audits are conducted for sites to examine the effectiveness of their own OHS management system in order to continuously improve the system and ensure that occupational accidents are prevented. The HQ OHS Office and Regional Safety Offices carry out corporate audits to examine compliance with corporate rules. External audits are conducted to provide confirmation of the effectiveness of the OHS management system by a third-party certification body.
These three types of audits combine to determine the effectiveness of the Sony Group OHS management system as a whole.
The HQ OHS Office is responsible for training corporate auditors and examining the effectiveness of audits carried out at the regional level.
Once it has established an in-house auditor system and determined auditor qualification requirements, it conducts periodic auditor training to enhance auditing skills.

Occupational Health and Safety Initiatives by Region/Business. 
Occupational Health and Safety Initiatives in Japan/East Asia. 
In fiscal year 2021, 7 out of the 11 accidents caused by unsafe behavior that led to absence from work were due to slips and falls, and there is a tendency for the length of absences from work to increase.
Although the number of accidents causing absence from work among external contractors’ employees working at Sony sites decreased, such accidents continue to occur. Sony will further reduce industrial accidents through efforts such as raising awareness of accidents caused by slips and falls, measures to prevent recurrence, and the lateral sharing of examples of good practices, and by requesting that external contractors cooperate in ongoing safety activities.
As initiatives to reduce employee health risks, Sony carries out risk assessments in response to changes in work styles and workplace environments, with a particular focus on working from home, and is boosting mental health awareness. In addition, Sony has achieved its goal of “banning indoor smoking” and keeping workplaces free of second-hand smoke at its main business sites in Japan, and continues to educate smokers on the risks and provide support for kicking the habit.
In fiscal year 2021, Sony continued to regard the COVID-19 pandemic as a new health risk and has been implementing measures to prevent its spread at all of its sites, including disinfection and temperature checks when entering premises.
Occupational Health and Safety Initiatives in China. 
In the China region, Sony completed its transition to ISO 45001 certification in fiscal year 2020, with comprehensive ISO 45001 certification for the China Regional Safety Office and the manufacturing sites under its jurisdiction. In fiscal year 2021, the scope of the OHS management system was expanded to include non-manufacturing sites, and seven non-manufacturing sites were among the sites that acquired comprehensive certification.
Also, various ongoing regional safety initiatives have been implemented since fiscal year 2015 to achieve zero occupational accidents. These include raising awareness of near-miss accidents, safety simulations for electric motorbikes, and production of safety videos. In fiscal year 2021, Sony produced a regional traffic safety video that is being widely used in orientation courses for new recruits and in safety training. It also ran training to foster a better understanding of traffic laws and regulations, and a total of 25,000 employees at 12 business sites attended the course.
Emergency Preparedness. 
The SEL Security team hosts an emergency preparedness event and releases newsletters twice a year. The event in December 2021 featured the “If You See Something, Say Something” campaign and the current run-hide-fight guidance from the U.S. Department of. 
Homeland Security. It highlighted how to recognize and report terrorism-related suspicious activity.

Maintaining and Promoting Health. 
Creating a Workplace Culture of Wellness. 
It is essential that employees be mentally and physically healthy if they are to perform at their best and create innovation. Sony focuses on enhancing organizational and personal well-being (health and happiness) by fostering a corporate culture that values both body and mind in order to help ensure sustained growth for both the company and employees.
Using data from health checkups and stress checks, Sony is addressing employee’s health issues involving mental health, balancing medical treatment and work, and lifestyle diseases and taking various steps to resolve these issues.
Sony is focused on the prevention and early detection of health problems, improving the workplace environment, and the health literacy of employees, through attentive and individualized support, education and training for line managers, and providing information and activities to raise awareness via a variety of channels.
Promoting Mental Health. 
Sony implements comprehensive mental health support measures with the aim of helping employees to display their full potential.
These efforts are focused particularly on preventing health problems and motivating employees and organizations.
Employees with fewer stress responses such as fatigue and anxiety tend to display higher levels of engagement. To bolster the ability of the individual to manage stress, which is a key to a vibrant organization, Sony holds mindfulness workshops for employees. It also holds online sessions for communication between employees and medical professionals, and is facilitating such dialogues in an endeavor to boost the health literacy of its employees with regard to managing their health with new work styles.
Support for individual employees is also important. Sony has established health-counseling services, offering access to counseling with clinical psychologists, industrial physicians and occupational health nurses via in-person or online sessions. Sony also works with outside professional organizations to implement a program under which employees returning to work after taking mental health leave receive help readjusting to the workplace via Sony’s employee assistance program (EAP). Sony has a mental health support program in place to provide employees with psychological care in the event of natural disasters and other incidents, as well.
Helping Employees Receive Treatment while Working. 
Sony actively seeks to provide support that will enable employees to strike a proper balance between treatment and work, and to feel fulfilled and motivated in their work. In fiscal year 2020, Sony introduced the Symphony Plan, a program to help employees attain this particular balance. Sony has increased the involvement of medical professionals and incorporated expert perspectives to support the provision of working conditions tailored for individual treatment plans.
For employees who receive treatment for cancer or other diseases while continuing to work, Sony offers medical consultation with occupational physicians and occupational health nurses, who reduce such employees’ health risks by devising job arrangements tailored to each individual situation. To ensure that employees are able to choose from a diverse array of flexible work styles, their workplace works with the Human Resources Department and Occupational. 
Health Department to provide the most appropriate job support.
As part of its efforts to support cancer prevention and early detection,
Sony provides cancer education (e-learning) for employees and cervical cancer testing for younger employees. It launched a program in fiscal year 2021 to encourage employees to undergo secondary cancer screenings.
Health Management for Employees Who Work Long Hours. 
Working long hours for an excessive period of time not only causes physical and mental health issues, but also reduces the job satisfaction of employees and risks the health of the organization as a whole. Sony actively works to create a better working environment in both respects.
Line managers, the Human Resources Department, and the Occupational. 
Health Department work together to improve working environments, with workplace structures that do not concentrate an excessive burden on certain employees and a focus on workplace culture in which employees feel comfortable consulting with their superiors.
Sony provides education and training for line managers on the impact of working long hours to help them understand the health issues involved and enhance their skills of managing the work hours and health of the employees in their team. As part of the comprehensive efforts to help employees stay healthy and prevent health problems, Sony employees who work long hours are seen by industrial physicians and occupational health nurses.
Women’s Health. 
To establish dynamic working environments where women can display their abilities, it is important to address health issues that affect women. Sony is working to increase literacy about women’s health so that women can improve their own physical and mental health and reach their full potential. Sony seeks to educate and inform employees of all genders about health issues that affect women at different stages of their lives through various initiatives including online seminars led by experts. Additionally, Sony operates a support hotline for women’s health issues that lends a sympathetic ear and individualized advice about health issues that affect women.
Preventing Lifestyle-related Diseases. 
Preventing lifestyle diseases caused by lack of exercise and/or sleep, irregular eating habits, and other aspects of an imbalanced lifestyle is a major challenge for corporate employees. Sony makes sure that employees undergo comprehensive medical checkups and examinations and then receive personal health advice from industrial physicians and occupational health nurses, as well as support for follow-up examinations at medical institutions if needed. Sony also focuses on counseling and advice dealing specifically with managing metabolic syndrome. Additionally, Sony implements various.

initiatives to set employees up for better lifestyle habits and increase health literacy. These initiatives take into account analysis of data on employee health issues compiled by organization, based on data from employee medical checkups. The initiatives include disseminating lifestyle information and holding various seminars for employees.
Helping Employees Quit Smoking and Preventing Passive Smoking. 
Sony actively encourages employees to quit smoking and works to prevent second-hand smoke from affecting non-smokers. In order to eliminate unwanted second-hand smoke, Sony is moving forward with steps to eliminate cigarettes and smoking areas from working environments such as moving smoking areas outdoors. Industrial physicians and occupational health nurses work closely with employees who are smokers to provide one-on-one counseling and support to ensure that they correctly understand the health risks to themselves and, through second-hand smoke, to those around them, and to motivate them to quit smoking. Other support measures include providing financial assistance for employees to participate in stop-smoking support programs, support for outpatient stop-smoking medical consultations, and information and awareness-raising. These efforts are gradually reducing the percentage of smokers in the Sony workforce.
COVID-19 Measures and Accommodating New Work Styles. 
Sony is committed to maintaining a safe working environment that ensures sufficient physical distance between employees at business sites. In consideration of governmental guidance in each country and the specific work style of each of its diverse businesses, Sony limits the number of employees allowed to report for in-person work based on attendance plans at each company and unit.
With many employees working from home, Sony recognizes the importance of mental health care. Sony provides tips for self-care and employee care, and is enhancing autonomy and activating workplace communication to reduce the anxiety and sense of isolation of employees working from home.
Sony has also set up a counseling desk where medical professionals provide timely advice on topics such as reducing stress and improving working conditions and lifestyle habits while self-isolating and working from home.
Main Initiatives in Japan (Primarily for areas under restrictions during a state of emergency or quasi-state of emergency) • Prohibited international and domestic business travel • Expanded the provisions for working from home • Eliminated core hours in the monthly flextime system • Added special leave due to temporary school closure and special measures for the COIVD-19 vaccine • Relaxed restrictions on commuting to include private cars and bicycles • Paid allowances for working from home and to support COVID-19 infection prevention • Ordered employees to refrain from business meals • Opened satellite offices to support diverse work styles • Implemented corporate COVID-19 vaccination drive • Added special leave for the COVID-19 vaccination • Conducted harassment prevention training related to vaccination from Japan are stationed in 40 countries worldwide. This is why Sony has established a health management system that ensures that staff stationed overseas and their families can live and work in safety and good health. Before departing for an overseas post, in addition to receiving healthcare information, medical checkups, and vaccinations, employees are provided with information on the medical, health, hygiene conditions and medical facilities in the country where they will be stationed. Employees also receive online health guidance and counseling and regular healthcare information during their period of stay. During the pandemic, Sony is providing extensive information to employees on topics such as COVID-19 vaccines, adjusting to working from home and dealing with stress. It is also constructing a system that enables employees to receive a medical examination in the country where they are stationed if they are temporarily unable to return to Japan.
Sony offers employees who stationed overseas with the same stress checks that employees in Japan receive, working to improve work environment and support mental health at the place of assignment.
In addition, Sony works to prevent disease and mitigate risk, with industrial physicians tracking the situation at sites and medical facilities overseas to provide the support that employees working overseas need in order to feel secure.
Infectious Disease Measures. 
In addition to protecting employees who are active globally from the threat of infectious diseases by arranging for employees to receive necessary vaccinations if they work in or travel on business to countries at risk, Sony also provides information on safety and infectious diseases in specific countries, issues alerts, and implements such safety measures as restrictions on business travel under certain circumstances. Timely information on such infectious diseases as malaria, hepatitis, and HIV is also provided to employees. In Japan, if there is an outbreak of a new strain of influenza, tuberculosis, rubella, measles, or other illness, Sony cooperates with the government and other entities as necessary in order to respond flexibly while staying ready to implement business continuity plans. Sony provides male employees from age groups that were not vaccinated through public rubella vaccination programs with access to rubella antibody tests when they receive their regular health checkups.

Highlight. 
Dialogue with Stakeholders on DE&I and Social Justice. 
The ESG Briefing in September 2021 included explanations about “Protecting the Earth: Sony’s ‘Responsibility’ and ‘Contribution’” and “Evolution of Sustainability Management.” As stated in its Purpose, Sony’s goal is to create value for the society in which we live, through an array of businesses centered on people. Sony is fostering diversity, equity, and inclusion (DE&I) throughout the entire Group, where differences in background, gender, and ability are viewed as strengths.
It also promoting initiatives aimed at fostering diversity and social justice in its engagement with greater society, and referred to the initiatives as examples of this.
One example is the utilization of technology to enhance the accessibility of Sony’s products and services. Sony conducts interviews with employees and users with disabilities during the product planning and development process. With the feedback we receive from this user research and usability testing, we improve our products and services, thereby incorporating the needs of diverse customers. Sony is also devoted to creating an inclusive work environment where employees can pursue their careers regardless of any disabilities they may have.
Treating all people with respect and dignity is one of Sony’s most important principles. We have built a corporate culture which finds strength in the diversity of our businesses and employees. In 2020, Sony established the 100 million USD Global Social Justice Fund.
Through this fund, Sony Group companies will support initiatives that promote social justice and anti-racist initiatives to foster DE&I around the world.
As our society grows ever more unstable against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is becoming increasingly important to offer a physically and mentally healthy environment in which creators can immerse themselves in their work. For example, the Sony Music Group outside of Japan is working with NPOs and other organizations to provide support to artists in the US, the UK and other countries via the Artists & Songwriters Forward initiative. In Japan,
Sony Music has launched B-Side, a project to support both the mental and physical health of artists and creators signed with Sony Music, as well as the staff who support them. Sony will continue to provide various support so that diverse and talented individuals can maximize their creative potential.

Human Rights Initiatives. 
Human Rights Due Diligence. 
Sony is committed to respecting internationally recognized human rights in its business activities and value chains, and engages in initiatives to prevent or mitigate any potential negative impact in line with the United Nations Human Rights Council-published The United. 
Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGP).
The UNGP outlines preemptive steps companies should take to prevent or mitigate any negative impact on human rights in their business activities and supply chains.
Human Rights Impact Assessments. 
Sony has undertaken group-wide human rights impact assessments since 2012 in partnership with BSR, an independent, global, non-profit organization devoted to building a just and sustainable world to identify relevant risks and to work to mitigate them.
Sony draws up a list of human rights issues from international standards such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the ILO. 
International Labour Standards, and the OECD Guidelines for. 
Multinational Enterprises. We also reference source materials from human rights experts, advocates, academics, governments, NGOs and other experts to identify potential human rights risks. This information is compared to Sony’s areas of business to identify risks most relevant to Sony’s business activities.
Prevention or Mitigation of Potential Negative Impact on Human Rights. 
The human rights impact assessment carried out in 2020 identified the following as potential human rights risk areas: • Human rights risks related to workers in the electronics industry supply chain, including the procurement of raw materials • Potential human rights risks in new technologies such as AI • Potential risks that customers with whom Sony has direct or indirect business relationships may engage in human rights abuse. 
Sony has established areas of focus based on this assessment. Sony will prioritize action in the areas of focus listed below and further enhance initiatives to prevent or mitigate potential negative impact on human rights.
1 . Responsible supply chain 2 . Respect for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE&I) 3 . Responsible development and use of technologies. 
Key Human Rights Initiatives in Diverse Business Operations 1. Responsible Supply Chain. 
Sony believes that it bears responsibility for its entire product supply chain. This includes areas such as human rights, labor conditions and environmental protection, not only at its own productions sites but also at those of its suppliers and subcontractors. Sony is a founding member of the RBA and has played an active role on the RBA Board of Directors since 2020. The RBA Code of Conduct represents industry best practices; Sony was not only involved in its formulation but also adopted it as the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct. Sony electronics manufacturing sites and suppliers are requested to comply with the. 
Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct. They are also requested to carry out risk assessments, be subjected to regular monitoring regarding compliance with the Supply Chain Code of Conduct, and implement any necessary improvements based on the results of the monitoring.
Sony Manufacturing Sites. 
Self-assessment surveys were carried out at 12 Sony manufacturing sites in Japan, China, Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, and the UK in fiscal year 2021. The results showed a low level of risk at all of them.
Supply Chain. 
In fiscal year 2021, Sony requested new and existing suppliers to comply with the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct, and conducted assessments using questionnaire for 796 plants, written improvement instructions for 94 plants, and remote/on-site assessment for 39 plants to provide instructions for improvement.
Responsible Supply Chain 2. Respect for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. 
Sony is committed to creating a workplace that respects human rights and provides equal employment opportunities that allow all individuals to make the most of their capabilities. Sony also helps to ensure that workers’ rights are safeguarded by adhering to worker protection laws, regulations, and standards in all regions where it operates.
The Sony Group Code of Conduct, which sets forth Sony’s global policy on respect for human rights, also includes Sony’s policy on equal opportunity in employment and nondiscrimination. The Sony. 
Group Code of Conduct expressly states: “Sony strives to promote diversity and seeks to create a culture that allows all Sony personnel to contribute their unique talents and skills so as to provide the best products and services to our customers, and Sony is committed to recruiting, hiring, training, promoting and otherwise treating applicants and employees without discrimination based on factors that are unrelated to Sony’s legitimate business interests.”
Boosting Awareness of Human Rights Is a Cornerstone of Diversity. 
Human rights issues that corporations face today are increasingly complex and wide-ranging. Sony considers it essential to boost awareness of human rights, an awareness that underpins respect for diversity. The importance of this concept is emphasized in training courses and other actions taken by Sony to enhance employees’ understanding of human rights and diversity.
Global Social Justice Fund. 
Sony is committed to respecting human rights, advancing social justice, and promoting DE&I. One of Sony’s core principles is to treat all people with respect and dignity. Sony has built a corporate culture which finds strengths in diversity. To further these efforts, in 2020,
Sony Group established a US$100 million Global Social Justice Fund (“Fund”). Through this Fund, we support initiatives that promote social justice and anti-racist initiatives to foster DE&I around the world.
Sony’s Two Global Funds. 
Accessibility.

3. Responsible Development and Use of Technologies. 
Responsible AI Initiatives. 
Sony aims to use AI technology in its products and services in a manner that will enrich people’s lives and contribute to the advancement of society. In 2018, Sony was one of the first companies to establish AI. 
Ethics Guidelines to ensure that AI development and usage would be aligned with our values, including fairness, transparency, privacy, and stakeholder engagement. The Sony Group AI Ethics Committee, established in 2019, examines AI use cases to ensure compliance with these guidelines. In 2021, Sony added AI ethics assessments to the quality management system for electronic products and services, and established the AI Ethics Office as the office responsible for implementing the assessments. The AI Ethics Office serves as a centralized body to provide subject matter expertise to all Sony. 
Group businesses. Sony strives for ethics by design, meaning that ethical considerations are evaluated at every stage of the AI development process, from planning, to design, to development and deployment. In 2021, Sony also launched the AI ethics research flagship within Sony AI, with the goal of conducting cutting-edge AI research that will enable our AI products and services to be at the forefront of ethical technologies.
Responsible AI. 
Hotlines. 
Sony has established the following hotlines for employees and stakeholders to report and seek advice concerning any potential violation of laws, regulations, the Sony Group Code of Conduct, the. 
Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct or other internal rules. These hotlines equip Sony to respond quickly and appropriately, while giving full consideration to personal privacy. Sony strictly enforces confidentiality and ensures that reporters are not subject to reprisal for reporting or using these services.

In addition, an e-learning course focusing on the protection of human rights is provided to all employees of Sony Group Corporation as well as many Sony Group companies. In fiscal year 2021, 94% of eligible employees took the e-learning course.
Raising Employee Awareness of Human Rights. 
Sony Group companies in Japan have formed their diversity promotion committees, which conduct workshops on human rights, diversity, and related matters. Based on the information obtained from those initiatives, they collaborate laterally via a Diversity Liaison to share best practices and study the latest information. Serious cases of harassment and communication issues related to human rights are discussed within the overall system and appropriate responses considered.

Responsible Supply Chain. 
Materiality Rationale. 
In recent years, stakeholders have grown increasingly aware of how crucial it is that companies fulfill their overall responsibilities throughout their supply chains, including procurement and production. Sony takes these stakeholder concerns seriously and is working closely with its suppliers on initiatives in fields such as human rights, labor conditions, health and safety, and environmental protection. These initiatives cover not only Sony’s own sites, but sites throughout the supply chain — from parts and material suppliers, to mineral mining operations, to production sites operated both by Sony and by subcontractors.
Basic Approach. 
Each and every Sony director, executive, and employee complies with the Sony Group Code of Conduct and conducts ethical business practices. Based on this approach, Sony focuses on supply chain management and responsible procurement of minerals and works with suppliers and subcontractors to establish a responsible supply chain that ensures compliance with the Sony Supply Chain. 
Code of Conduct and the Sony Group Policy for Responsible Supply. 
Chan of Minerals. These efforts are undertaken in collaboration with relevant industry organizations and other stakeholders.
Structure. 
Under the Senior Executive in charge of Sustainability, the sustainability section and compliance department at the head office play central roles in promoting actions aimed toward creating a more responsible supply chain, cooperating with procurement and other related departments in our businesses, as well as management departments at manufacturing sites.
Looking to the Future. 
In order to further strengthen efforts to establish a responsible supply chain, Sony will expand assessments of its own sites and its suppliers, for example by having primary suppliers request secondary suppliers and other subcontractors to comply with the Sony Supply. 
Chain Code of Conduct. Sony remains committed to ongoing efforts to raise awareness, educate, and provide training not only to employees, but also across the supply chain, communicating with suppliers to raise awareness and the capacity to respond effectively to responsible supply chain issues. Sony will also continue to strengthen its countermeasures of high-risk minerals in its procurement.

Highlight. 
Communicating with Suppliers. 
Distributing Videos to Suppliers. 
In 2021, we distributed a video about sustainability to all our suppliers through a distribution system specifically for them in order to improve awareness of Sony’s sustainability activities overall, including conduct for a responsible supply chain. Available in Japanese, English and. 
Chinese, the video explains what is required according to the Sony Group Code of Conduct and. 
Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct, and requests the establishment of management systems for compliance with the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct upstream of the supply chain.
The video was also shared with internal procurement personnel, to aid in communication with suppliers.
Visualizing Supplier Sustainability Efforts. 
We check for supplier compliance with the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct, which includes their efforts for human rights, ethics, environmental and health and safety initiatives, and this oversight is vital to our supplier selection process. In consideration of the fact that supplier sustainability activities will continue to grow more important, In fiscal year 2021, we built a system to visually identify and centrally manage supplier sustainability achievement (including compliance with the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct, reducing the effect on the environment) and are preparing to more appropriately select suppliers in consideration of their results in the future. We communicate the meaning and social significance of these efforts, providing direct feedback to our suppliers to motivate them toward sustainable endeavors and maintain their compliance with the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct.
Training and Raising Awareness in Internal Procurement Personnel. 
We implement training for internal personnel who are involved in parts procurement for socially responsible procurement and the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct.
Continuing from the previous year, in fiscal year 2021, this training was provided to new employees and midcareer hires. The training covers the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct, as well as laws and regulations in different countries, responsible mineral procurement, environmental conservation, and management of chemical substance contained in product.
These sessions educate employees on the importance of responsible procurement and how it relates to their work while also assessing their general knowledge.

Establishing and Promoting the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct. 
Sony recognizes the increasing importance of global companies’ responsibility to manage their supply chains responsibly as diligent members of society. This extends beyond our manufacturing sites, including those of parts suppliers and subcontractors. Sony works with its suppliers to address issues such as human rights, labor conditions, health and safety, and environmental protection throughout its supply chain in order to ensure a responsible supply chain.
Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct. 
Sony was involved in establishing the RBA Code of Conduct, which indicates industry best practice, and adopted that code to establish the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct. Sony actively implements efforts to comply with the code for our manufacturing sites and suppliers. The RBA Code of Conduct has been translated into 26 languages including English, Chinese, Japanese, Thai, and Malay.
Compliance with the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct is included in contracts signed when Sony begins doing business. As a part of the customer requirements under this Code of Conduct, parts suppliers must comply with the Green Partner Environmental Quality. 
Approval Program and the Sony Group Policy for Responsible Supply. 
Chain of Minerals. Suppliers are also requested to distribute and comply with the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct within their own supply chain.

Organizational Structure. 
At Sony, the Sustainability Section and compliance groups at the head office take the lead in promoting efforts toward a responsible supply chain in cooperation with other related procurement divisions and management departments at manufacturing sites.
Under the supervision of the Senior Executive in charge of. 
Sustainability, the Sustainability Section at the head office assesses external trends and communicates with stakeholders, drawing on both to formulate basic company-wide supply chain management policy.
The Senior Executive in charge of Sustainability appoints the management responsible in each relevant business unit. They are then responsible for overall operational compliance for the area in their charge, including compliance with the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct, as well as risk assessment, regular monitoring and remedial measures. Administrative offices are responsible for overall implementation for suppliers.
In cases where assessments or external sources indicate any possibility of violations of the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct or a material legal violation, or in cases where the supplier does not provide adequate cooperation with assessments and audits, the managers responsible for implementing the rules work together with the Sustainability Section and compliance groups at the head office to determine the facts and take action deemed necessary, and the situation is reported to the Senior Executive in charge of Sustainability.
Initiatives at Sony Electronics Manufacturing Sites. 
Conducting Regular Assessments. 
As part of its efforts to ascertain Sony manufacturing sites’ compliance with the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct, Sony uses standard tools provided by the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) to check compliance, assess improvements, and implement other monitoring activities.
Specifically, Sony utilizes the RBA questionnaire as an annual self- assessment survey at all of its electronics manufacturing sites in and outside of Japan to evaluate compliance designated by the Sony. 
Supply Chain Code of Conduct in terms of labor, health and safety, ethics, environment, and management systems. At manufacturing sites where self-assessment surveys indicate issues with compliance and further evaluation and improvement in these areas are deemed necessary, appropriate measures to improve compliance are developed and implemented.
In fiscal year 2021, 12 manufacturing sites in Japan, China, Korea,
Thailand, Malaysia and the UK, completed self-assessment surveys.
The results showed that risk of noncompliance was low at all manufacturing sites.
Employment and Working Conditions of Foreign Workers. 
In recent years, forced labor among foreign and immigrant workers at factories manufacturing electronic products and components has become an issue both in Japan and around the world.
Since fiscal year 2017, Sony has been conducting surveys of actual work conditions and risk assessments to monitor the employment status and labor conditions of foreign workers at Sony manufacturing sites in Japan. The assessments check whether the site has any foreign workers or not (in either direct or indirect employment) and confirm the hiring processes and labor conditions. The surveys of actual conditions are conducted for selected manufacturing sites. In fiscal year 2021, Sony continued to conduct document assessments of on-site subcontractors at a number of manufacturing sites to verify their hiring processes for technical intern trainees in Japan and the countries in which they were hired, as well as the labor conditions of trainees. The results showed that steps are continuously being taken to ensure compliance with the labor standards set out in the Sony.

Sony’s Approach to Supplier Relations. 
Requesting Compliance and Monitoring Compliance Status with the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct. 
Requesting Compliance. 
Compliance with the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct is included in contracts signed when Sony begins doing business with suppliers.
All suppliers are provided this Code of Conduct upon signing a new contract, and are kept informed of changes through updated documents. Further, Sony regularly reminds suppliers of their responsibilities and obtains a compliant consent from them. Upon the revision of The Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct in 2021, the code was distributed again with a further reminder, and a compliant consent was obtained.
When starting new business dealings with suppliers, Sony requests compliance with the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct not only from the primary supplier, but also from plants supplying materials and parts.
Furthermore, if a primary supplier is a trading company, Sony acquires a compliant consent from the parts manufacturer and manufacturing sites through the trading company and confirms that compliance is implemented.
Sony also distributes the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct to our own supply chain, requesting through primary suppliers that it is observed by secondary and further suppliers.
Supplier Assessment. 
To ascertain supplier compliance with the Sony Supply Chain Code of. 
Conduct, Sony conducts assessments based on the supplier’s risk level for all suppliers and their manufacturing facilities. If Sony does not deal directly with the manufacturing facility, the assessments are conducted through the trading company or manufacturer that is the primary supplier.
If a manufacturer is suspected to be in violation of the Sony Supply. 
Chain Code of Conduct, instructions for improvement are issued, an on-site assessment is conducted and employees and managers are interviewed in person to verify the actual management situation, based on the identified potential risk. If issues are found, guidance for improvement is provided, and we continue to verify and evaluate subsequent actions taken. Sony’s policy is to review its business relationship with a supplier if a serious violation (such as forced labor, child labor, inhumane working conditions, unlawful discrimination, lack of an emergency and disaster action plan, presence of risks that cause a serious life-threatening accident to a worker, significant environmental pollution issues) of the Sony Supply Chain Code of. 
Conduct is confirmed or if the supplier fails to cooperate fully in an investigation or audit.
New Suppliers. 
Sony conducts assessments based on the supplier’s risk level for all new suppliers and their manufacturing facilities. All direct suppliers and their plants are requested to comply with the Sony Supply Chain. 
Code of Conduct. Suppliers and their plants are categorized by risk level, based on such factors as the country and region in which they are located, size of business, industry, and type of business. Suppliers and their plants conduct an assessment using questionnaires from the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA).
In assessment, questionnaires evaluate compliance with the Sony. 
Supply Chain Code of Conduct specifically in items related to forced labor among foreign, migrant and immigrant workers, which has become a serious issue worldwide. Questionnaires returned by suppliers are analyzed to identify potential risks for individual manufacturing plants.
Existing Suppliers. 
Major OEM and ODM suppliers that do sizable business with Sony continue to conduct annual assessments using questionnaires from the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA). If an assessment indicates a high risk, the OEM or ODM supplier is subject to an on-site audit, which may include an audit by a third-party. Furthermore, with growing stakeholder interest in the issue of forced labor in the electronics industry supply chain overall, Sony has been strengthening activities related to periodic assessment of existing suppliers for compliance with the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct since 2020.
Just as for new suppliers, existing suppliers and their plants are categorized by risk level, based on such factors as the country and region in which they are located, size of business, industry, and type of business to determine if they fit criteria for assessment.
Assessment using labor issues-specific questionnaire is conducted for applicable existing suppliers, and supplier response is analyzed to identify potential risks for individual manufacturing plants.

Responding to External Reports. 
In cases where any possibility of violations of the Sony Supply Chain. 
Code of Conduct is reported via external sources, such as NGOs or media reports, we work expeditiously and objectively to confirm facts regarding the report, including an RBA audit by a third-party auditor.
If this determination confirms the reported violations at our electronics manufacturing sites, Sony ensures that corrective action is immediately taken, including an RBA audit conducted by a third-party auditor. At supplier plants, we promptly request to make an improvement plan.
We request progress reports for implementation of these plans and check further by conducting follow-up audits as needed. In cases where any possibility of violations is reported at a secondary supplier,
Sony works with the primary supplier to ensure that remedial action is carried out. Sony’s policy is to review its business relationship with a supplier if a serious violation of the Sony Supply Chain Code of. 
Conduct is confirmed or if the supplier fails to cooperate fully in an investigation or audit.
Communicating with Suppliers. 
Sony is deeply committed to communicating with suppliers and is involved in a variety of measures to this effect. See the Highlights page for further information on these efforts in 2021.
Communicating with Suppliers. 
Supplier Hotline. 
Sony has established a Supplier Hotline which suppliers may use to report conduct by a Sony Group company executive or employee that violates laws, regulations, the Sony Group Code of Conduct, or the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct, as well as conduct that violates the company’s agreements with suppliers as a framework to facilitate sharing of concrete information.
Supplier Hotline (in Japanese)
Participation in the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA)
Supply chains overlap considerably in the electronics industry, with multiple manufacturers of finished products sharing the same subcontractors and parts suppliers. Accordingly, there are fears that the introduction of independent, company specific standards for socially responsible management will cause confusion and constitute a significant burden on companies in the supply chain.
With the aim of improving processes in the electronics industry supply chain, in 2004 Sony and other companies established the. 
Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC, currently the RBA). The alliance then developed the RBA Code of Conduct (formerly the EICC. 
Code of Conduct) incorporating best industry practices.
The RBA is working with its member companies to develop tools that help to establish and manage codes of conduct, Web-based systems, and skills development programs for suppliers. As of June 2022, the. 
RBA consisted of more than 200 participating companies from. 
Europe, the Americas and Asia, and members included manufacturers and OEM companies. The RBA has membership categories for different levels of engagement and has granted Full. 
Member status to Sony, its highest membership category. Sony was granted representation on the RBA Board of Directors in 2020.
The RBA promotes corporate social responsibility (CSR) in supply chains through the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI), which addresses issues with minerals procurement, the Responsible Labor. 
Initiative (RLI), which addresses human rights issues such as forced labor, and other programs.

Responsible Sourcing of Minerals. 
In recent years, stakeholders have become increasingly concerned about violations of the human rights of workers and environmental issues in the sourcing of mineral resources essential for the manufacture of electronic products. Sony is working with its suppliers to address issues related to human rights, labor conditions, health and safety, and environmental protection at production sites, as well as in its procurement of minerals.
Establishing the Sony Group Policy for Responsible Supply Chain of Minerals. 
Some minerals that are used in Sony products carry human rights and environmental risks in the extraction process.
In the Sony Group Code of Conduct, Sony set forth basic policies including prohibition of using any form of forced labor, specifically, child labor. Sony has established the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct to be complied with throughout the electronics product supply chain.
In addition, in October 2017, Sony established the Sony Group Policy for Responsible Supply Chain of Minerals, replacing the Sony Group. 
Conflict Minerals Policy that was established in 2014.
Basic Policy. 
In the policy, Sony pledges that, in order to avoid contributing to conflicts or serious human rights abuses through its sourcing practices,
Sony identifies certain minerals that are sourced in conflict-affected and high-risk areas and that are high-risk for Sony from the perspective of corporate social responsibility (“High-Risk Minerals”). Sony’s policy is to refrain from knowingly purchasing any products, components or materials that contain High-Risk Minerals that contribute to conflicts or serious human rights abuses in the chain of custody.
High-Risk Minerals. 
Tantalum, Tin, Gold, Tungsten and Cobalt. 
Expectations for Suppliers. 
Sony requires its suppliers to source High-Risk Minerals from smelters determined to be compliant with the Responsible Minerals Assurance. 
Process (the “RMAP”) * protocols established by the Responsible. 
Minerals Initiative (the “RMI”), or other smelters that have been determined not to be contributing to conflicts or serious human rights abuses under other trusted traceability projects.
* Responsible Minerals Assurance Process: A program in which a third party certifies that the minerals handled by the smelter are from sources that do not fund armed conflict or engage in human rights violations.
OECD Due Diligence Guidance Initiatives. 
Sony exercises due diligence on the source and chain of custody of. 
High-Risk Minerals in our supply chain to determine supplier compliance with our policy. We follow the Organization for Economic. 
Cooperation and Development (the “OECD”) Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from conflict affected and high-risk areas (the “OECD Guidance”) or other internationally recognized framework when conducting such due diligence.

Addressing the Issue of Conflict Minerals. 
Addressing US Law on Conflict Minerals. 
The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and adjacent countries have been mired in conflict with armed groups perpetuating human rights abuses in that region. These armed groups have been trading in certain minerals commonly found in that region to finance their activities. These minerals, tantalum, tin, gold and tungsten (“the four minerals”) are commonly found in many products, ranging from jewelry to electronics to airplane components. Section 1502 of the. 
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in the. 
United States, which first became effective in January 2013, defines the four minerals as “conflict minerals.” This law seeks to ensure transparency and reporting related to conflict minerals and requires companies whose stock is listed on a US stock exchange, as Sony’s is, to conduct an inquiry into the origin of the four minerals in their supply chains. On May 26, 2022, Sony submitted its ninth report to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) based on its review of its supply chain activities for the 2021 calendar year.
Sony’s SEC Report (Form SD & Conflict Minerals Report) [PDF:593KB]
Survey and Results on Use of the Four Minerals. 
The four minerals enter global supply chains from numerous countries. Determining the mine of origin for these minerals requires the cooperation of many levels of suppliers and intermediaries in the supply chain. Sony is committed to working with suppliers to continuously improve supply chain transparency and reduce risk.
Investigation on the origin of the four minerals used by the Sony. 
Group overall is conducted as follows.
1 . Every survey year, Sony checks each business group to see if there is any possibility for the four minerals being used in its products 2 . Sony further looks for the presence of the four minerals in the products of the identified business group that are manufactured or outsourced for manufacturing by Sony in the survey year and identifies target products 3 . The survey is conducted using the RMI Conflict Minerals Response. 
Template (CMRT), the industry standard, and target suppliers are asked to participate by filling out a survey response for each product concerned. in order to identify the smelters or countries of origin for the procured minerals concerned 4. The smelters indicated in the survey responses are then carefully compared to the RMI smelters list.
In 2022, while the results of Sony’s due diligence for the 2021 report to the SEC was not able to confirm the country of origin for all of the tin, tantalum, tungsten or gold in Sony’s electronics products, the country of origin of these minerals was not identified as being from the DRC or adjacent countries. In the 2021 survey, Sony identified a total of 339 smelters and refiners as potential sources of the four minerals and, of those, 255 smelters and refiners were compliant with. 
RMAP or were certified by London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) *1; 153 of these smelters and refiners*2 in the supply chain were reported to procure materials from the DRC and its adjacent countries.
*1 Includes smelters under RMAP assessment *2 Please refer to the smelter list in the aforementioned Sony report to the SEC, which includes smelters confirmed as conflict-free through Sony’s traceability program.

Expectations for Sony Suppliers of the Four Minerals. 
If it is determined that any of the four minerals are used in the manufacture of products, Sony requires relevant suppliers to comply with the Sony Group Policy for Responsible Supply Chain of Minerals and to fully cooperate with its due diligence efforts regarding sourcing the four minerals in accordance with the terms of this policy. In addition, to ensure that products, components or materials delivered to Sony do not contain any conflict minerals, Sony expects suppliers to have in place pertinent policies, a due diligence framework and a management system consistent with the OECD guidance.
Approach to Mitigating Risks in the Supply Chain. 
In the event that Sony confirms that any of its products, components or materials may contain conflict minerals, Sony, in collaboration with relevant suppliers, shall take actions reasonably necessary to eliminate such minerals from such products, components or materials and shall request that the suppliers makes necessary improvement to its sourcing practices. This includes adoption of a conflict-free sourcing policy, increased responsiveness and accuracy of the supplier survey, and increased use of the four minerals sourced from smelters or refiners participating in the RMAP program. Further, in the event that. 
Sony confirms that a supplier has failed to cooperate sufficiently with a due-diligence investigation, fails to follow Sony’s requests for remediation or has otherwise violated this policy, Sony shall take necessary actions, including without limitation, termination of business with such supplier by stopping new orders. As part of its efforts to promote RMAP-conformance among smelters, Sony identifies non-conformant smelters and works with them to gain certification. In 2021, 58 suppliers specified in their CMRT that they source from smelters that were not listed as conformant or that were unwilling to undergo an RMAP assessment. As a result of an improvement request by Sony, 36 suppliers conducted investigations and responded that the non-compliant smelters were not in fact in their supply chains, while we continue to request improvement from the remaining 22 suppliers.
Sony has also established a hotline to allow any interested party to voice concerns regarding the circumstances of mineral extraction, trade, handling and/or export in conflict affected and other high-risk areas. In addition to its internal risk assessments, the hotline enables. 
Sony to be alerted to risks in its supply chain.
Sony Group Policy for Responsible Supply Chain of Minerals Hotline. 
Managing the Cobalt Supply Chain. 
Cobalt is an important mineral used in lithium-ion batteries for a wide range of products including electric vehicles and smart phones. There have been concerns about child labor and working conditions at sites where it is extracted in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), a country known to have the largest reserves of cobalt in the world.
In 2016, a supplier reported that some lithium-ion battery parts procured by Sony contained cobalt produced in the DRC. In response,
Sony established the Sony Group Policy for Responsible Supply Chain of Minerals in October 2017. This policy is a revision of the Sony. 
Group Conflict Minerals Policy, which targeted the four minerals. In addition to the four minerals, Sony has recognized cobalt as another. 
High Risk mineral and launched efforts to build a responsible cobalt supply chain.
Since then, Sony has continued to manage its cobalt supply chain using industry standard tools, such as the Cobalt Reporting Template (CRT) developed by RMI, and by carrying out further third-party RMAP audits of cobalt refineries.
In fiscal year 2020, we conducted a CRT-based survey of lithium-ion battery suppliers and identified cobalt refineries in the supply chain.
As we identified the refineries not compliant with RMAP, we requested that such refineries conduct third-party RMAP audits and that suppliers with such refineries in their battery supply chain also encourage such refineries to conduct third-party audits.
In fiscal year 2021, Sony conducted CRT based surveys of 8 lithium- ion battery suppliers. Within these, we identified 23 cobalt refineries in the supply chain, and confirmed that all were either RMAP- compliant or currently conducting third-party RMAP-based audits (as of March, 2022) .
Multi-Stakeholder Cooperation. 
Sony recognizes that multi-stakeholder collaboration is the key to identifying and mitigating the adverse human rights impact that can be associated with mineral extraction in high-risk areas. Specifically,
Sony continuously collaborates with various multi-stakeholder efforts such as RMI in order to participate in the development of the due diligence process and mitigate human rights risks in the supply chain.
Participating in Industry Groups and the Public-Private Alliance. 
For High-Risk Minerals, Sony actively participates in and supports industry groups and alliances that identify the negative effects of mineral mining in high-risk areas, and works to mitigate or prevent these effects.
RMI. 
In 2011, RBA launched the industry-leading Conflict Free Sourcing. 
Program (CFSP, currently RMAP), then, with the aim of promoting collaboration with other industries and multiple stakeholders outside electronics, established RMI (formerly CFSI) in 2013. Sony utilizes the frameworks developed by theses industry groups and alliances as part of its efforts to ensure responsible sourcing of raw materials. RMI holds workshops for discussions with NGOs, socially responsible investors, local government representatives and other stakeholders, in which Sony participates.
Furthermore, Sony donates to the following RMI-related funds.
• The Initial Audit Fund (RMAP Audit Program):
This fund helps cover the costs for cobalt refineries to undergo third-party RMAP audits (donated fiscal year 2016-2019, 2021) • RMI-Pact partnership for supporting Alternative Livelihoods through a Vocational training program:
A program in cooperation with Pact, an NGO that provides vocational support to young people in cobalt mining areas of the DRC (donated fiscal year 2020) • Better Mining:
A project in cooperation with the RCS Global Group that aims to improve the health and safety of mines in areas of the DRC where artisanal and small-scale mining takes place (donated fiscal year 2020)

The Sony Group exhibited at the 37th CSUN Assistive Technology Conference (CSUN)* in. 
Anaheim California from March 14 to 18, 2022.
By exhibiting at CSUN, Sony is promoting efforts to improve accessibility by making more customers aware of accessibility-friendly products and services, and listening to the voices of various customers.
The 2022 CSUN was an in-person event and the Sony Group booth had measures in place against COVID-19. BRAVIA™, PlayStation®5, SRS-NS7, LinkBuds and the Alpha 7 IV were among the products on display. People of all ages with diverse needs and backgrounds visited the Sony Group booth and provided a lot of new perspectives and valuable feedback.
Sony will continue to provide opportunities for customers to experience products and services for themselves, and to reflect the feedback it receives in its initiatives to improve products and services.
* The world’s largest international conference focused on “Accessibility,” which introduces the latest products, services and initiatives in this field.
CSUN. 
In order to enhance security quality, since 2017 each business unit has been conducting annual inspections to ensure these security quality measures are being properly implemented for all products and services. Such inspections enable Sony to swiftly identify new challenges, such as the need to respond to vulnerabilities in the supply chain, and to formulate, add and implement improvement strategies in order to maintain and improve security quality.
Sony has included requirements for conformance to the IoT security regulations in the Sony. 
Security Development Life Cycle, and is establishing operations that observe the relevant laws in individual countries/regions.
Sony recognizes that ensuring the security of the products and network services it provides is a key quality requirement (security quality) and strengthens it every year. The prevention of product security issues is an ongoing initiative to maintain and enhance safe and reliable security quality so that vulnerabilities in shipped products and network services cannot be exploited to cause problems.
In 2012, the Sony Security Development Life Cycle was formulated as measures and rules to enhance security quality throughout each phase, from product development and network service planning right up to the time the product becomes waste or the network service is terminated. Those measures and rules are in place for all Sony products and network services.

Responding to the Customer. 
Sony makes active use of customer feedback to improve its products and customer service. Sony customer information centers promptly and accurately evaluate customer opinions, reports of malfunctions after purchase, questions regarding use, and other feedback. These feedbacks are aggregated in the database for the planning, design and product quality groups to work together to improve product quality and strengthen product performance, reporting progress to top management on an as-needed basis.
In recent years, the communication tools used by customers have become more diverse. In order to meet broader customer expectations, Sony has started to analyze customer feedback on social media as well.
Quality Hotline. 
It is vital to detect product quality-related problems at the earliest stage possible. To that end, Sony has established the Quality Hotline to gather product quality-related information, including reports of problems, as well as opinions from Sony Group employees.
Group employees can use the Quality Hotline, an in-house website, to send messages regarding matters that are too difficult to handle at their workplace, such as certain product quality issues. They can also share findings identified during customer use of products and any problems with the quality of product-related customer service as perceived by customers who have made use of those services. Upon investigating a problem to ascertain the veracity of the information received, the Quality Hotline office proposes and introduces measures to prevent previous problems from recurring and precluding potential new problems.
Market Quality Improvements. 
Sony has established dedicated quality management organizations in each of its business areas that are responsible for improving the quality of pertinent products in each market. At Sony headquarters, information related to quality issues arising in the marketplace is gathered in a timely manner from a broad range of sources in Japan and overseas and reported weekly to headquarters quality management and technical specialists. Based on the reported information, Sony ascertains whether or not issues in the marketplace have been addressed appropriately. In addition to ensuring that such issues are thoroughly addressed, Sony is accelerating its quality improvement performance by promoting measures to prevent recurrence and proactive measures in relation to quality issues.
Responses to Quality Issues. 
Sony recognizes that ensuring its customers’ satisfaction, confidence and trust is one of its most important management tasks and strives to prevent quality-related problems through the systems and efforts described above.
Sony responds swiftly in the event of a quality-related issue, with the relevant departments working together to investigate facts and take appropriate action on a global scale. When such an issue arises, Sony decides upon the need for public announcements and market action for customers, and implements any needed steps after undertaking various studies of the issue, following a process common to all Sony products.
This process starts with the gathering of information from customer service centers worldwide and collaboration with concerned local parties to ensure an accurate grasp of the issue. Based on information collected, Sony then works to determine the correct response by identifying the cause of the issue, implementing countermeasures and promptly verifying the effectiveness thereof, and reviewing the issue from the customer’s perspective. Sony also cooperates with CS officers at sites in each region to ensure the same level of service is provided to customers the world over.
With regard to methods and media for issuing public announcements of product quality-related issues, Sony examines the effectiveness of the various means at its disposal, including the. 
Internet, e-mail, notification via app, or other media.

Improving the Quality, Safety and Long-Term Reliability of Products. 
Improving the Quality of Products. 
Sony strives to maximize product quality by improving design, manufacturing, and parts.
Design-Related Quality Initiatives. 
In the initial stages of the design process, the individual in charge of a particular business unit verifies new technologies and new parts and, from the user’s perspective, determines how a product is to be used. At the conclusion of the design process, the individual in charge confirms the degree to which the intended levels of product quality and reliability have been realized. In addition, to ensure that customers are provided with products of a quality worthy of the Sony brand, Sony requires relevant departments including original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and original design manufacturer (ODM) companies to comply with group-wide quality standards. Compliance with these standards is also tested at the end of the design process. Such approaches prevent the occurrence of problems pertaining to new technologies and new product parts, while also ensuring that product designs incorporate consideration of user convenience.
Production-Related Quality Initiatives. 
In the effort to ensure that Sony does not receive, manufacture or ship anything with quality-related problems, Sony adheres to a policy of workmanship at all of its manufacturing sites that ensures customers can use Sony products with confidence. Initiatives include setting important targets at each manufacturing site and implementing PDCA processes, thereby facilitating the achievement of such targets and the continuous improvement of product quality. Sony has also established standard product quality rules to ensure Sony products manufactured by OEM/ODM companies are of the same high quality as those manufactured at Sony production sites.
Parts-Related Quality Initiatives. 
Recognizing the importance of parts and determined to manufacture products built for long-term use, Sony carefully selects key parts independently for each of its major product categories and is pursuing focused efforts aimed at increasing the reliability of the parts it uses through cooperation among relevant departments.
Improving Product Safety. 
Providing reliable products that customers can use safely is a top priority for Sony. Accordingly, at every stage of its business activities, including product planning, development, design, manufacturing, marketing, and after-sales service for all products and services, Sony takes steps to comply with safety standards based on laws and regulations while constantly striving to surpass those standards in order to maintain the safety of its products. As part of these efforts, Sony has established a team in charge of product safety assessment from a medical perspective. When developing products employing new technologies and using new technologies at events, Sony also seeks advice on product safety from a medical perspective from outside experts in order to ensure products do not affect customer health, and this advice is then incorporated into technology assessment, product development, design and engineering. When deemed necessary, Sony also conducts evaluation tests to assess safety with the assistance of a specialized organization. If a safety-related problem involving a Sony product is reported, Sony immediately collects information and examines the facts, and then takes the steps necessary to rectify the problem.
Improving the Long-Term Reliability of Products. 
Sony has established a Quality Reliability Lab supporting Sony’s commitment to deliver safe, durable and reliable products to customers.
The Quality Reliability Lab has assigned specialists to work full time on improving technologies essential to product reliability and continues working to ensure the long-term reliability of products by developing elemental technologies for preventing age-related deterioration and corrosion of materials and parts, as well as technologies necessary to ensure the reliability of new technologies and functions required for new products and to analyze and evaluate such technologies and functions. These technologies and the information obtained through these activities are utilized to improve design and parts selection processes and increased reliability of products. Sony also presents some of its own knowledge of evaluation technologies at academic meetings and industry conferences and gatherings, seeking to go beyond its own walls and contribute to the industry.
Efforts to Improve Quality of Product Security. 
With more products connecting to networks, there is a heightened danger of personal information leaks, falsification or destruction of data, product hacking and other such security issues. As a consequence, it is very important to improve the quality of the security of products and network services.
Sony has a function for collecting security risk-related information from outside experts, researchers and other individuals. Sony assigns managers responsible for the software security of products and has a dedicated department for it. The department coordinates with business units to address issues with the security of products. Based on the information received, the department assesses the impact of risk on customers from a software security perspective and implements appropriate measures.
To deliver products that customers can use with confidence, Sony has security design and response systems that ensure the security of products over their entire life cycle — from planning and shipment to disposal — such as conducting security risk assessments, using product security vulnerability detection tools, and security inspections prior to product shipment. Sony has also established internal guidelines pertaining to the security of products and continues to implement employee training programs to strengthen product security.
Due to growing concern over security issues with Internet of Things (IoT) devices, regulators in countries/regions are developing new laws and regulations concerning IoT security. Sony is establishing internal frameworks for gathering and responding to regulatory information in order to secure regulatory compliance.
Responsible AI. 
In accordance with the Sony Group AI Ethics Guidelines, Sony established an internal document stipulating requirements to be complied with in the commercialization process of electronics products and services, and in July 2021 started to include AI ethics assessments in the product development life cycle.

Customer Service. 
In addition to continuously improving product quality, Sony is taking various steps to improve its responsiveness and its customer service capabilities, in line with its commitment, set forth in the Sony Pledge of Quality: “Sony employees will always respect our customers’ viewpoints in striving to deliver product quality and customer service that exceed their expectations.” In customer service, this includes responding to changing customer needs, and in repair services, building organizations designed to ensure the best possible repair service quality.
System. 
Sony has assigned CS officers responsible for improving the quality of customer service in markets around the world where Sony products are sold. Under the guidance and supervision of the Senior Vice. 
President in charge of Quality Management and of regional headquarters, Sony has also introduced a set of key performance indicators to enhance customer service quality on a global level. Sony has also established a network of bases through which it provides services tailored to the needs of customers in each region.
Training for Customer Support Staff. 
Committed to providing high-quality services to customers around the world, Sony provides ongoing training for employees and the staff of service partners. In addition to focusing on the acquisition of new service technologies and the sharing of solutions to ensure issues are swiftly and effectively addressed, staff are trained to help customers get the greatest possible enjoyment from their Sony products.
Customer Information Centers and Customer Service Improvements. 
Sony established its first customer information center in 1963 in Japan to respond to customer inquiries. Today, Sony has customer information centers worldwide, enabling it to provide prompt responses to customer needs that reflect customers’ perspectives, thereby helping Sony to improve the quality of its customer service.
In addition to support via telephone and e-mail, in several regions. 
Sony provides customer support via such means as live Internet chat sessions, support using social media and messaging apps, and online community forums where customers can share information to help each other find solutions. In these ways, Sony tailors its support to meet the increasingly diverse needs of its customers in every region of the world.
In addition, Sony conducts surveys to determine customer satisfaction at various touchpoints, and makes improvements based on the survey results in its efforts to continually improve customer satisfaction.
More Convenient, Eco-Friendly Instruction Manuals. 
To provide better explanations on how to use its products, Sony is bolstering its online support and providing online instruction manuals for improved searchability and greater convenience so that users are able to quickly find what they are looking for.
The Sony website has a support section that offers not only information on the products themselves but also additional support information on software upgrades and network service updates. This is designed to help users better understand Sony products, software, and services, as well as to enable them, when needed, to troubleshoot as quickly as possible. To accommodate a variety of user environments, Sony also provides support information compatible with mobile devices for greater customer convenience.
When it comes to printed product manuals, Sony provides brief “startup guides” that focus on the information needed to begin using a product, such as how to connect and set up, and how to use the basic functions.
For some products sold globally, Sony has developed instruction manuals with minimal text and more extensive visuals, making it possible to include multiple languages in a single manual, which is expected to contribute to environmental protection by reducing paper consumption.
Repair and Service Network. 
Currently, there are 3,458 Sony repair service locations worldwide. To enhance customer satisfaction, Sony is working to meet customer needs by performing immediate problem diagnosis at the repair reception desk, improving repair quality and reducing the number of days required for repairs, among other efforts. In addition, Sony is continuously enhancing its service network to ensure that it can respond appropriately to repair requests in each region for each product. By strengthening the feedback mechanism for product quality based on repair information, Sony also aims to keep enhancing quality.

Improving the User Experience. 
User experience is an essential aspect of quality at Sony.
In order to gain an accurate understanding of the increasingly diverse needs of customers and to deliver a superior user experience, Sony has adopted Human-Centered Design (HCD) processes and ensures that its design efforts always take the customer’s perspective.
System. 
Sony is promoting HCD via collaboration between relevant departments and business groups. The initiative is driven by a team that promotes activities across the Group and is overseen by the corporate executive officer in charge of product quality. Products and services are becoming more multi-functional all the time, and their user interfaces also tend to be more complex with the advance of technology. Sony employs intradepartmental cooperation on development to deliver products and services that people can use with ease and comfort.
Using Human-Centered Design in Product and Service Development. 
Sony is working to improve product usability and create experiences that meet the core needs of customers. It conducts worldwide user research including home visits and user interviews. These efforts are part of a continuing cycle of issue identification and product improvement, which includes prototyping and usability testing in the upstream stage of design. Employees also conduct long-term usage surveys, including interviews with customers, both before and after product release. In addition, Sony analyzes how customers feel and behave when they use a service, and then works to improve the user experience by sharing customer feedback with relevant personnel.
Human-Centered Design (HCD)
Systems for User Research and Testing. 
Sony has built an environment and established systems that ensure user research and testing can be carried out quickly and efficiently via group-wide collaboration spanning sites in Japan, North America,
Europe, India, and China. Via steps such as the introduction of online systems, it ensures that the necessary user research and testing can be carried out in spite of the physical constraints imposed by the. 
COVID-19 pandemic. There is also an internal monitor program through which employees and their families participate in questionnaire surveys, interviews, and usability tests. These systems and programs enable Sony to deliver a superior user experience and keep creating products that are easy to use.
Human Resource Development and Awareness-raising Activities on HCD. 
In order to continue delivering a superior user experience, Sony launched a system in 2021 to certify employees with a high level of expertise and experience as HCD experts. These experts will play a leading role in the workplace. Eight HCD experts were certified in the first phase, and Sony is working to ensure that HCD becomes further entrenched in development departments.
Sony provides internal training so that not only experts but also development site personnel and leaders can acquire the needed skills to help deliver experiences that better meet the needs of customers.
People with HCD skills are also being actively hired in order to increase the number of employees with a high degree of expertise who are ready to lead customer-focused initiatives. In order to further deepen employee understanding of HCD, Sony also holds timely lectures and events open to all employees featuring internal and external experts. Through these activities, employees involved in various aspects of product and service creation are working to acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to master HCD.
Usability testing. 
Formulating Internal Standards and Applying Acquired Expertise. 
Product and service designers from across the Sony Group meet to formulate standards for interactions, use of words and icons on devices and screens, and so on. The knowledge gained through user research and testing, the expertise of the product development departments, and case studies of the application of UX (user experience) design are shared across the Group as well.
These standards and expertise are posted on Sony’s internal portal site to ensure that everyone at the Sony Group has access to them.
This information is used in product and service development as Sony continues to work to enhance usability for customers.

Accessibility. 
With the purpose of “filling the world with emotion, through the power of creativity and technology,” Sony continues to pursue accessibility initiatives in order to contribute to a future where everyone can equally share “Kando” (emotion).
System. 
Under the Senior Vice President in charge of Quality Management, a team that promotes accessibility and inclusive design* across the group stands at the core of efforts involving cooperation with the people responsible for promoting accessibility in the business units.
Having established a globally consistent set of standards and systems, we are using them as the basis for continuous improvements. We provide comprehensive support for the Sony Group’s accessibility- related activities, including employee training, company-wide lectures, surveys and evaluation tools designed to improve accessibility, and the introduction of inclusive design.
* Inclusive design is an approach that obtains new insights into designs for all by ensuring that the needs of a wide range of users are understood and included.
Ensuring That as Many People as Possible Can Enjoy Sony Products and Services. 
In December 2019, Sony joined The Valuable 500, an international initiative to help promote participation by individuals with disabilities so that they can demonstrate their latent potential to bring value to business, society, and the economy. From amongst the 500 signatories, Sony was selected as one of the Iconic Companies that will play a leading role in their country, region and industry. As part of this role, Sony is promoting accessibility and inclusive design initiatives group-wide so that as many customers as possible can enjoy Sony products and services. For information on accessible products and services, please visit the Accessibility page of the Sony. 
Group Portal website.
Accessibility. 
Employee Education. 
Sony Group holds forums and seminars led by experts to increase employee understanding of accessibility.
E-learning training is offered at the principal Sony Group companies to foster a general understanding of accessibility, and around 28,500*1 employees took the course in 2021.
Every year on Global Accessibility Awareness Day (GAAD)*2, Sony. 
Group companies hold lectures and events to enhance employee understanding of accessibility. For example, Sony Pictures. 
Entertainment (SPE) held a lecture for its employees to coincide with. 
GAAD. In addition, SPE held “family-friendly sensory screenings” with adjusted lighting and sound setting for persons with hypersensitivity, such as autism, which were offered at offices in the US. The aim was to boost employee awareness and understanding of hyperesthesia while enjoying a movie with employees and their family members and those who have this condition.
*1 The number of participants in Japan.
*2 Global Accessibility Awareness Day is a day to discuss, think and learn about accessibility and inclusion for those who need it.
Inclusive Design Initiatives. 
To enhance accessibility and enable more people, including people with disabilities, to enjoy its products and services, Sony employs inclusive design. Sony incorporates feedback gained through the participation of employees with disabilities in the planning and development process, interviews with people with disabilities, and usability tests.
For example, in developing televisions, Sony asks users with visual impairments to try the products for a designated period of time, participate in hands-on experience and provide feedback on how to improve product design. Sony released the PS5™ software Ratchet &
Clank: Rift Apart in 2021 which features a great set of accessibility features. They were developed by employees with disabilities alongside external accessibility consultants and other employees with diverse backgrounds.
Employees with disabilities evaluate the Walkman® so that their perspectives can be incorporated into the product on an ongoing basis.
Collaborative Initiatives. 
Sony is also accelerating collaborations with other companies to enhance accessibility and inclusion. Its truly wireless headphones. 
LinkBuds, released in February 2022, were a collaborative project with. 
Microsoft Soundscape to empower richer experiences for everyone to explore their surroundings using 3D spatial audio. Sony also participates in the “With My Eyes” project to bring “difficult to see” into “clearer sight” for people with low vision, QD Laser, Inc.’s laser retina projection device can be attached to Sony cameras, allowing people with low vision to shoot video and still images with their own eyes.
Movie Initiatives. 
Sony Pictures Entertainment (SPE) is developing a process for creating audio descriptions and captions* for use when movies are screened in cinemas or released on DVD or Blu-ray. The audio description system uses audio to convey information, such as people’s movements, movie scenes, captions, and on-screen messages, primarily for people with visual impairments. Captions are primarily for people with hearing disabilities. They show the names of the people speaking and their lines as well as meaningful onscreen information on the audio, such as music, sound effects, and ambient noises. Audio description and captions enable more people to enjoy movies and videos.
* The movies where these features are supported vary by country and region.
Independent Employee Initiatives. 
Groups of employees (Employee Resource Groups) at Sony are taking the lead in improving accessibility.
At Sony North of America and Sony Interactive Entertainment, employee networks are leading the way in supporting employees with disabilities and regularly disseminating information to raise awareness of accessibility within the company. For example, the diverse range of perspectives brought by Sony Interactive Entertainment’s employee resource group in Europe and America played a central role in the development of the ABLE@PlayStation Inclusive Language Guide.
This guide helps to resolve mutual misunderstandings, improve communication, and boost awareness. It has also been made available for external use to support inclusivity for all outside of Sony.

Making the Most of Diverse Customer Feedback. 
Sony exhibits at accessibility-related events in order to gather consumer feedback and use it to improve products and services. It has been exhibiting at the CSUN Assistive Technology Conference (CSUN), the world’s largest international showcase for accessibility, since 2018. In March 2022, Sony’s accessible products such as. 
BRAVIA™, PlayStation®5, a wireless neckband speaker and the Alpha 7 IV were on display at CSUN.
At the TechShare Pro conference gathering for accessibility experts held in November 2021, Sony once again participated as a Silver. 
Sponsor and featured its products online.
Moreover, Sony sites in Europe and the United States also provide opportunities for regular dialogue with organizations of people with disabilities as part of efforts to make Sony’s products and services even easier to use.
Standardization for Accessibility Improvements. 
Sony has established its own evaluation standards for accessibility, based on industry standards and designed to improve the quality of accessibility in its products and services. These standards are implemented company-wide. Periodic product assessments are carried out using the standards, with a particular focus on electronics products such as BRAVIA™ and Xperia™. The results of those assessments are then leveraged in ongoing efforts to improve products and services.
Sony is also proactively involved in standardization* activities aimed at driving improvements in accessibility throughout the industry.
* IEC 62731 Text-to-speech for television; IEC 62944 Digital Television Accessibility;
IEC TC 100/TA 16 Active Assisted Living (AAL), accessibility and user interfaces. 
Working to Enhance Sony Website Accessibility. 
Sony has established the Sony Group Web Accessibility Policy which sets forth the accessibility standards and compliance requirements for all Sony Group Companies’ websites. Sony Group’s web accessibility requirements are aligned with the Web Content Accessibility. 
Guidelines (WCAG) published by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).
With the use of websites and other digital platforms continuing to rise, the Sony Group Web Accessibility Policy seeks to ensure that. 
Sony Group companies’ websites are designed and developed in a way that is accessible to all, including members of the disabled community and the elderly.
Sony has been actively promoting the established web accessibility policy, as well as working with companies within the Sony Group in implementing the policy and conducting checks to ensure compliance.
Sony has regularly conducted a range of web accessibility trainings targeting different roles in the organization and will continue to do so in the future.
Creating an Environment for Carefree Internet Use. 
Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE) will continue to make games as popular as music, movies and broadcasting, and has been developing the PlayStation® business for users in all age groups.
Console game industry organizations have responded to the proliferation of new game genres by introducing rating systems for customers in Japan, the United States and Europe (CERO, ESRB and. 
PEGI, respectively), based on games’ target age groups. Sony has applied the U.S. system for more than 20 years, offering parents and guardians suggested age categories and descriptions that detail the contents of a game. PEGI is endorsed by the European Commission as a paradigm of self-regulation in the entertainment industry. In. 
Japan, measures are being promoted to make the system more effective, including, with the cooperation of retailers, the voluntary refusal to sell software rated by CERO for ages 18 and above to underage customers.
SIE has enhanced its parental controls features on its game consoles, including PlayStation®5. This enables parents to navigate the play experience of their family in a way that works best for their needs.
For example, the family manager can control the setting so their children can only use the console to enjoy games that are suitable. 
Sony Life Insurance Co., Ltd. and Sony Assurance Inc. provide sign language and written communication services to facilitate inquiries from customers with hearing or speech disabilities. Operators use their sign language interpretation skills for sign language or written conversations with customers.

Community Engagement. 
Materiality Rationale. 
Sony can only create sustainable social value based on its Purpose when society itself is healthy. It is Sony’s responsibility as a global company to recognize various social issues and contribute to the creation of a sustainable society via community engagement activities.
Doing so helps Sony to build relationships of trust with communities.
Basic Approach. 
Under the slogan “For the Next Generation” and based on its policy of community engagement, Sony develops initiatives in collaboration with various stakeholders in order to contribute to the resolution of a wide range of global issues by making the most of. 
Sony products, content, and technologies.

The Basics. 
Sony’s ethics and compliance program starts with “Tone from the. 
Top.” Senior management continuously communicates the importance of being true to Sony’s core ethical values. Their commitment is supported by a robust ethics and compliance program aligned with business processes, including policies and procedures, training and messaging, ongoing risk assessments, program assessment and surveys, third party management, reporting mechanism, and monitoring and audits. Sony continuously improves its program in accordance with regulatory guidance and other leading practices that organizations with mature ethics and compliance programs have found to be effective.
The Sony Group Corporation Board of Director’s Audit Committee provides oversight of Sony’s program and receives monthly reports and periodic in-person updates concerning ethics and compliance program activities. Reports to the Board’s Audit Committee provide program performance results, compliance hotline metrics, employee training data, and new program and communications initiatives, and updates on global regulatory developments. In addition, the. 
Sony Group Corporation Board of Directors also receives annual updates on compliance related risks and Sony’s global ethics and compliance program.
Policies and Procedures. 
Sony’s global policies provide necessary rules and procedures to help ensure ethical and responsible business conduct and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. For example, Sony maintains global policies in each of the following risk areas. • Sony Group Anti-Bribery Policy • Sony Group Record Retention Policy • Sony Group Economic Sanctions Compliance Policy • Sony Group Customer Due Diligence Policy • Sony Group Global Policy on Antitrust / Competition Law. 
Compliance • Global Insider Trading Prevention Policy. 
These policies are regularly communicated to all Sony Group personnel and relevant third parties. The Sony Group Anti-Bribery,
Economics Sanctions and Customer Due Diligence policies provide screening for applicable transactions to help ensure compliance with anti-corruption, sanctions and anti-money laundering laws.
Training and Messaging. 
Sony adopted a “Compliance Education Protocol” to ensure that minimum ethics and compliance training and communications in critical risk areas are provided to all employees and relevant third parties working for Sony. For example, all Sony personnel and relevant third parties working for Sony are required to complete the. 
Code of Conduct and Proper Workplace Conduct training within 90 days of first providing services to Sony. Additional compliance training is mandated based upon risk assessments and employee and third party roles and responsibilities.
Key Compliance Training (assigned based upon risk assessments and roles and responsibilities) includes: • Anti-Bribery • Economic Sanctions Compliance • Customer Due Diligence • Antitrust and Fair Competition • Import / Export Trade Compliance • Information Security and Privacy • Manager Training. 
Risk Assessment Areas under Ethics and Compliance Program. 
Sony conducts ongoing risk assessments to help assure that Sony’s ethics and compliance program activities effectively mitigates and manages top risks.

Reporting Mechanism. 
Sony provides many different types of resources to employees to enable them to raise concerns to ensure the effectiveness of Sony’s global ethics and compliance program. Please refer to “Sony Ethics &
Compliance Hotline” for more details.
Monitoring / Audit.

This is done by conducting periodic assessments of program implementation on a global basis. It also conducts risk- based compliance audits and validations of controls.
Sony Ethics & Compliance Hotline. 
Sony believes that a “speak up / listen up” culture — where employees are encouraged to raise concerns and feel confident that they can do so without fear of retaliation — is a key to early detection and prevention of ethical and regulatory problems.
Multiple Reporting Channels. 
Sony provides many different types of resources to employees to enable them to raise concerns, including the Sony Group Ethics &

Compliance Officer, collect more information, or take other actions as appropriate. The Office also works with legal and/or other subject matter experts to determine how best to investigate and resolve the allegations. Management will take corrective action to improve business operating systems or take disciplinary action against employees who have violated the law or company policy, when the facts warrant doing so.
Each Regional Compliance Officer reviews all reports and responses in his or her region, as an added check to help assure matters are fully and fairly addressed. The status of raised concerns is also reported on a monthly basis to the Sony Group Corporation. 
The Hotline is available online (in 27 different languages) or by phone, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The phone lines are staffed by specially trained third party representatives, with translators in up to 52 different languages. All information provided to the Hotline is handled confidentially.

Third Party Management. 
Sony is firmly committed to ethical and responsible business conduct in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. As part of. 
Sony’s commitment to ethical and responsible conduct, Sony only does business with reputable third parties. Sony established internal rules and procedures to help ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations related to potential third party risks, which include: anti-corruption, anti-money laundering, economic sanctions, trade controls, tax laws and restrictions on other financial crimes. Sony identifies transactions that may pose higher risks. Sony performs pre-transaction due diligence, and ongoing monitoring, for these higher risk transactions to protect Sony Group companies from being involved in transactions concerning the proceeds of criminal conduct and/or with entities or individuals who are designated on an economic sanctions list and/or trade control list. Depending on the risk profile of the transaction, additional protections, such as contractual warranties may also be required. Sony provides periodic training to ensure its employees are well aware of policy requirements as well as relevant “red flags” identifying potential transaction risks.
Any concerns are promptly investigated via the Global Network and the legal department of each subsidiary. Appropriate action for the case such as disciplinary, remedial, or corrective measures are considered and implemented.
Anti-Bribery and Corruption. 
Sony believes that corruption negatively impacts the communities and economies where we do business and that it must be eliminated to realize a sustainable, inclusive and transparent society. One of the core principles set forth in Sony Group Code of Conduct is the need to give due consideration to the impact of our business activities on the interest of our stakeholders. Sony Group Code of Conduct prohibits all types of corrupt practices. Sony has also adopted a global anti-bribery policy that contains rules and procedures designed to prevent corruption involving government officials (“Sony. 
Group Anti-Bribery Policy”). All Sony Group personnel are required to read, understand and follow the Sony Group Anti-Bribery Policy and the Sony Group Code of Conduct.
Sony closely monitors global anti-corruption law enactment and enforcement trends to ensure that Sony’s global ethics and compliance program and internal controls properly address these evolving risks.
Policies • Sony Group Code of Conduct prohibits improper payments in every transaction, whether with a government official or with a private party.
• The Sony Group Anti-Bribery Policy was established and most recently revised in 2022 under the policy above. It identifies types of transactions that are considered to pose higher risks based on regulatory landscape and Sony’s business and provides conditions and procedures that all Sony Group personnel must adhere to when interacting with officials of various governments around the world. This includes strict limitation on the type of expenditures that are permitted, due diligence and pre-approval requirements.

Sony believes it is important to protect the personal information of. 
Sony’s customers, employees and other stakeholders and thus ensure trust.
Sony has entered a new digital age, where the global privacy landscape and advancements in information and communication technology are changing at a faster pace than ever before. New global privacy laws continue to emerge, raising the bar for privacy compliance across the world.

Responsible AI. 
Framework for AI Ethics Initiatives. 
Through the utilization of artificial intelligence (AI), Sony aims to contribute to the development of a peaceful and sustainable society while delivering kando — a sense of excitement, wonder or emotion — to the world. At the same time, Sony understands that the influence of AI on society is multi-faceted and can have unintentional consequences.
Sony established the Sony Group AI Ethics Guidelines in September 2018 to guide all Sony officers and employees to utilize AI and/or conduct AI-related R&D in a manner that conforms with our values and emerging social norms. The guidelines were subsequently revised to align with Sony’s Purpose established in January 2019 to “fill the world with emotion, through the power of creativity and technology.”
In December 2019, Sony established the Sony Group AI Ethics. 
Committee and since that time has been strengthening its initiatives and framework for AI ethics. In 2021, the AI Ethics Office was established to provide subject matter expertise on AI ethics to all Sony business units. In addition, Sony has established a notification system for AI utilization in products, services, and internal operations in Sony. 
Group’s business units, to share information on AI ethics risks. In. 
March 2021, in accordance with the Sony Group AI Ethics Guidelines,
Sony established an internal document stipulating requirements to be complied with in the commercialization process of electronic products and services, and in July 2021 started conducting AI ethics assessments in the product development life cycle. Sony uses e-learning tools to promote an understanding of AI ethics among its employees and invites speakers from outside the company to discuss this issue at lectures and symposia.
Stakeholder Dialogue and External Collaboration. 
Sony actively pursues dialogue with relevant companies, organizations, and the academic community on ethical issues surrounding AI utilization, while considering the interests of diverse stakeholders, including customers and creators.
In May 2017, Sony became the first Japanese company to join the. 
Partnership on AI to Benefit People and Society (PAI), a non-profit organization created to contribute to solutions for some of humanity’s challenging problems, including advancing the understanding of AI and addressing ethics surrounding AI technology. One of the most common issues in AI ethics is that of fairness, transparency, and accountability, abbreviated as “FTA.” Sony utilizes knowledge it has gained from its AI and robotics related research, development, and business ventures and contributes to a number of working groups addressing this issue. Sony chaired the Social and Societal Influences of AI Working Group, which focuses on the social impacts of AI, and currently serves as an expert advisor for PAI’s strategic planning. Sony also serves on the steering committee for ABOUT ML,* an initiative to improve the transparency of machine learning. Sony also serves as an expert advisor to the Explainability Research Project and Diversity and Inclusion Research Project. Sony’s Global Head of AI Ethics is also one of the General Chairs of the 2022 ACM Conference on Fairness,
Accountability, and Transparency (FAccT), the premier conference on sociotechnical algorithmic systems.
Sony is also involved with Japanese initiatives to establish principles and guidelines that promote the utilization of AI for social good.
These initiatives include the AI Utilization Strategy published by. 
Keidanren (Japan Business Federation) in February 2019 and the Social. 
Principles of Human-centric AI published by Japan’s Cabinet Office in. 
March 2019. Sony is currently a member of the Conference toward AI. 
Network Society, a group within the Ministry of Internal Affairs and. 
Communications whose goal is the comprehensive study of the social, economic, ethical, and legal factors involved in the promotion of AI networks throughout society as a whole. Additionally, Sony is a participant in the Global Partnership on AI, an initiative launched in. 
June 2020 to promote the development and utilization of AI based on human-centric principles, and serves as a member of the AI and. 
Pandemic Response Subgroup, a working group that aids the development of responsible AI solutions for epidemics of infectious disease such as COVID-19.
* ABOUT ML stands for “Annotation and Benchmarking on Understanding and. 
Transparency of Machine Learning Lifecycles.”
Trusted R&D for AI. 
Sony pursues R&D for AI that is trusted and backed by solid technologies, and is engaged in technical initiatives related to AI ethics.
As a solution for securing FTA, Sony equipped its AI development tool Neural Network Console with eXplainable AI (XAI) to make it easy to use. XAI is a technology that enables people to understand the logic behind AI decision-making, an area often called the “black box” since it is not always immediately apparent. Sony has also released its machine learning fairness library and Responsible AI XAI source code as open source software. Additionally, Sony provided its. 
Prediction One predictive analysis tool with the ability to visualize the predictive reasoning.
In 2021, Sony also launched the AI ethics flagship within Sony AI with projects to conduct cutting-edge research on the challenges faced in the development of AI products and services, including ethical data collection and algorithmic fairness. Taking advantage of its position as a company that extends across a wide range of industries, Sony will put fair and transparent AI into practice, leveraging its global and diverse perspective.

Corporate Governance. 
Materiality Rationale. 
Historically, Sony Group Corporation has consistently focused on effective group management by evolving its governance while diversifying its businesses, the regions it serves and its capital procurement methods. Sony Group Corporation therefore sees corporate governance as the basis for management that improves corporate value over the mid- and long-term as highly important, not simply as a response to legal requirements or social trends.
To realize Sony’s Purpose and achieve sustainable corporate growth, Sony Group Corporation continuously strives to operate. 
Sony effectively by maintaining objective, transparent and sound management and realizing timely and efficient decision-making.
Basic Approach. 
Sony Group Corporation continuously strives to strengthen its corporate governance system based on the understanding that corporate governance is an essential basis to promote our management in order to fulfill the company’s corporate social responsibility and increases corporate value over the mid- and long-term. To operate Sony effectively, Sony Group Corporation continues to approach its corporate governance through two basic precepts: (a) The Board of Directors (the “Board”) , a majority of which is comprised of independent outside Directors, focuses on effective oversight of management’s operation of the business and maintains a sound and transparent governance framework by utilizing the Nominating Committee, the Audit Committee and the Compensation Committees; and (b) The Board determines Sony’s fundamental management policies and other material matters and delegates to each of the Senior. 
Executives that assume important roles for the management of. 
Sony, including the Corporate Executive Officers, decision-making authority to conduct Sony’s business operations broadly in line with their respective responsibilities, as defined with a view to promoting timely and efficient decision-making within Sony.
Structure. 
In furtherance of these efforts, Sony Group Corporation has adopted a “Company with Three Committees” corporate governance system under the Companies Act of Japan (Kaishaho) and related regulations (collectively the “Companies Act”). Under such system, Sony Group Corporation has introduced its own requirements to help improve and maintain the soundness and transparency of its governance by strengthening the separation of the Directors’ function from that of management; maintaining what the company believes is an appropriate Board size, which enables the members of the Board to actively contribute to discussion; and advancing the proper functioning of the statutory committees.
Milestones 1961: Issued American Depositary Receipts (ADRs); Started US-GAAP accounting 1970: Listed on the New York Stock Exchange and disclosing quarterly earnings release 1971: Started appointing independent directors 1997: Introduced a new corporate executive officer system 2003: Adopted a company with three committees system 2005: Majority of the board became independent 2015: Split out business units as subsidiaries 2021: Launch of Sony Group Corporation.

Basic policy regarding Senior Executive remuneration. 
Senior Executives are key members of management responsible for executing the operations of Sony as a whole, or of their respective businesses.
In order to further improve the business results of Sony, the following two elements have been established as the basic policy for the determination of remuneration of Senior Executives. • Securing a talent pool possessing requisite abilities from a global perspective; and • Providing effective incentives to improve business results on a short-, medium- and long- term basis.
Based on the above, Senior Executive remuneration shall primarily consist of the following components. The amount of each component and its percentage of total remuneration shall be at an appropriate level determined in accordance with the above basic policy and the individual’s level of responsibility. The amount and percentage will also be based on research conducted by a third party regarding remuneration of management of both Japanese and non- Japanese companies, with an emphasis on linking Senior Executive remuneration to business results and shareholder value.
Type of remuneration Description. 
Fixed remuneration • Set at an appropriate level determined based on research conducted by a third party regarding remuneration of management of both Japanese and non-Japanese companies with a view to the level of responsibility of the Senior Executive and maintaining competitiveness for securing talent.
Remuneration linked to business results • Structured appropriately and based on appropriate metrics to ensure that such remuneration effectively incentivizes Senior Executives to achieve financial targets for the mid- and long-term and financial targets for the fiscal year for which compensation will be paid.
• Specifically, the amount to be paid to Senior Executives shall be determined based on the level of achievement of the two metrics below and can fluctuate, in principle, from 0% to 200% of the standard payment amount depending on the level of achievement. (1) Certain key performance indicators linked to the consolidated or individual business results of Sony during the fiscal year, such as Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS (net income attributable to Sony Group Corporation’s stockholders per share), which are selected based on the areas for which each Senior Executive is responsible.

• Efforts to accelerate value creation through collaborations among the businesses of Sony, sustainability initiatives related to social value creation and ESG (environment, social and governance) and engagement indicators based on employee surveys shall be included in the evaluation factors for individual performance.

Thereafter, the Compensation Committee determines the amount of such remuneration based on the level of achievement of the financial performance KPIs and each executive’s individual performance at the meeting of the Compensation Committee held after the corresponding fiscal year end for Corporate Executive Officers. Bodies or individuals under the supervision of the Compensation Committee make those determinations for Senior Executives other than.

The Compensation Committee determined a target for Adjusted. 
EBITDA for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 that was meant to incentivize management to achieve the 4.3 trillion yen for the three- year period from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022. The target for. 
Adjusted EPS for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 was 523.2 yen, which was obtained by dividing the forecast of net income attributable to Sony Group Corporation’s stockholders for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, which was disclosed in April, 2021 (660 billion yen) by the number of diluted shares outstanding at the beginning of such fiscal year. The results for the Financial.

As outlined above, including the formula, the remuneration linked to business results for Corporate Executive Officers for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 was determined based on the level of achievement of the financial performance KPIs and the individual performance for which those Corporate Executive Officers were responsible. Consequently, the range of potential payment was determined to be, in principle, between 0% and 200% of the standard payment amount. As a result, the ratio of remuneration linked to business results of Corporate Executive Officers for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 varied from 167.8% to 178.5% of the Business.

Board of Directors’ Determination Regarding Internal Control and Governance Framework Pursuant to the Japanese Companies Act and Status for Implementing the Internal Control and Governance Framework. 
As for the summary of the principal frameworks of the internal control and governance framework based on the Board determination above, please refer to each page below.
Financial Reporting Framework. 
Sony’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with Internal Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).
Sony formed a cross-functional steering committee comprised of management in charge of the principal Sony headquarters functions to monitor the actions necessary to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, including documenting, testing and evaluating internal controls and overseeing and assessing the global evaluation.
Based on the evaluation by Sony Group Corporation, CEO and CFO have concluded that Sony maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2022.
Disclosure Framework. 
The securities of Sony Group Corporation, the ultimate parent of all. 
Sony companies, are listed for trading on exchanges in Japan and the. 
U.S. As a result, Sony is obligated to make various disclosures to the public in accordance with applicable securities laws, regulations and rules in those countries and listing standards of the stock exchanges on which Sony Group Corporation’s shares are listed. Sony is committed to full compliance with all requirements applicable to its public disclosures.
Sony Group Corporation’s policy on investor relations activities is to aim to disclose accurate information in a timely and fair manner, as well as to endeavor to promote constructive dialogue with shareholders and investors, with a view to maximizing Sony’s corporate value by building a relationship of trust with shareholders and investors. Sony Group Corporation has established disclosure controls and procedures as an approach to implement this policy. All personnel responsible for the preparation of submissions to and filings with the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the U.S. Securities and. 
Exchange Commission and other regulatory entities, or for other public communications made on behalf of Sony, or who provide information as part of that process, have a responsibility to ensure that such disclosures and information are full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable, and in compliance with the established disclosure controls and procedures.
Sony Group Corporation has established “Disclosure Controls and. 
Procedures,” outlining the process through which potentially material information is reported from important business units, subsidiaries, affiliated companies and corporate divisions and is reviewed and considered for disclosure in light of its materiality to Sony. As a body to assist the CEO and the CFO of Sony Group Corporation, in designing, implementing and evaluating the Disclosure Controls and. 
Procedures, Sony Group Corporation has established the “Disclosure. 
Committee,” which is comprised of members of senior management of Sony who are in charge of a part of Sony’s headquarters functions.
In order to assure appropriate and timely disclosure, the Disclosure. 
Committee shall evaluate events that are reported from the important business units, subsidiaries, affiliated companies and corporate divisions in accordance with Sony’s internal rules in light of their materiality to Sony. Based on such evaluation, the Disclosure. 
Committee shall review the necessity of disclosure in accordance with applicable securities laws, regulations and rules, as well as the listing standards of the relevant stock exchanges, and report to the. 
CEO and the CFO for their determination.
Risk Management System Framework. 
Each business unit, subsidiary / affiliated company and corporate division of Sony periodically reviews and assesses risks for the area of which it is in charge and works on finding, reporting, assessing and responding to the risks. In addition, Senior Executives including. 
Corporate Executive Officers, of Sony Group Corporation have established and maintain a system to identify and control risks that may cause losses to Sony Group regarding the areas of which they are in charge. The Corporate Executive Officer in charge of group risk control comprehensively promotes and manages the establishment and maintenance of the system stated above through the activities with related departments.
Examples of risks that may significantly impact investor judgements include reduced market relevance and profitability due to intensifying competition from competitors; newly incurred costs to comply with laws and regulations in countries and regions where Sony operates; impact on global operations due to trade restrictions and economic sanctions imposed by certain countries and retaliatory measures to them; impairment of long-lived assets; and changes in consumption behavior caused by the increasing prevalence of new technologies and distribution platforms.

Crisis Management System Framework. 
One aspect of risk management is the proper handling of crises if and when they arise, and the proper preparation for such crises. Sony. 
Group’s crisis management and business continuity activities predominately occur at the business and operational level closest to the events Sony Group may encounter. Since some events can have a significant impact on the entire Sony as a whole, Sony Group. 
Corporation has established a group crisis management procedure to enable a swift and organized group-wide response to crises as needed.
Framework on Business Continuity Planning. 
Sony has strengthened its business continuity planning (BCP) to enhance risk management throughout the supply chain. The group identifies, analyzes, and evaluates business risks in order to mitigate the risk of business disruptions due to emergencies such earthquakes, natural disasters, and accidents.
Sony’s electronics business struggled to cope with the impact of the. 
Great East Japan Earthquake and severe flooding in Thailand in 2011, and with the impact of the earthquakes in the Kumamoto region of. 
Japan in 2016. Nevertheless, Sony’s employees and top management rallied together, capitalizing on their experiences in implementing measures to ensure business continuity, and succeeded in minimizing the impact of production disruptions. Knowledge gained from recovery efforts after the Kumamoto earthquakes was shared with relevant companies and local firms through industry bodies, to enhance the competitiveness of Japanese industry and strengthen supply chains. Utilizing lessons learned to date, Sony pursues ongoing initiatives to reduce business disruption risks at its business sites, from the perspectives of disaster prevention, disaster mitigation, and business continuity.
Sony Group Corporation has established a group-wide crisis management and business continuity framework for reviewing crisis management and BCP at each of its businesses and preparing for incidents and business disruptions that would significantly impact the entire Sony Group. In order to boost the effectiveness of Sony’s business continuity planning, top management and Headquarters organizations carry out exercises based on scenarios such as natural disasters posited by the Japanese government.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Sony has established a group crisis management system, placing the highest priority on ensuring the safety of employees and others and preventing the spread of the virus, as well as taking swift action to minimize the impact on Sony businesses.
For example, Sony has shipped and supplied more than 1.2 million face masks to Sony group companies in Japan, Southeast Asia, Europe, and the United States, and supplied Sony group companies in India with medical equipment. Sony is securing business continuity through global coordination while implementing measures in accordance with internal guidelines, and preparing emergency supplies.
Additionally, Sony establishes and manages crisis management and business continuity plans to minimize the impacts of business interruptions. To increase the effectiveness of these efforts, Sony is strengthening its business continuity and enhancing rapid recovery through coordination between the relevant companies and organizations and by conducting realistic exercises.
Sony recognizes the importance of BCP to its business strategy.
Taking into account its experience with large-scale emergencies,
Sony will continue to implement effective, practical measures, such as enhancing risk management across its group-wide supply chains.
Main Initiatives for Reducing Business Disruption Risks for Building and Equipment. 
Countermeasures against Earthquake. 
Utilizing lessons learned from the Kumamoto earthquakes, Sony has established guidelines for seismic measures for Sony group companies in Japan. These measures, which are essential to the safety of employees, are established by determining the seismic wave activity at each business site and conducting simulations to assess risk. The seismic measures apply to building structures and utility facilities as well as non-structural materials such as ceiling materials, to enhance safety in an earthquake. Sony has completed the implementation of particularly high-priority safety measures.
Countermeasures against Fire. 
The Sony Group has global guidelines to facilitate early fire detection and protection against the spread of fire in buildings and equipment.
These guidelines are stricter than the regulatory requirements in. 
Japan. Under the guidelines, Sony’s manufacturing sites around the world implement annual self-checks and are regularly audited on-site by the HQ Facility Management Office to verify compliance with them. Manufacturing sites implement Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycles to address any uncovered issues and establish improvement plans to effectively reduce risks.
Countermeasures against Flood-related Damage. 
Flood-related damage is on the rise due to the impacts of climate change. Sony surveys the flood risk at its business sites, which in turn implement preventative measures to mitigate damages in the event of a flood and ensure operations can be rapidly restored.
Case Example for Reducing Business Disruption Risks. 
Semiconductor Manufacturing Site:
Seismic Isolation Structure and Initiatives to Reduce Fire Risks. 
The Nagasaki Technology Center of Sony Semiconductor. 
Manufacturing Corporation became the first manufacturing site of the Sony Group to adopt a seismic isolation structure. This is being incorporated in its expansion building, which will be completed in stages from 2021 onwards. The seismic isolation system employs a hybrid seismic isolation structure with multiple base isolation devices to mitigate earthquake motion, and micro-vibration control that is essential for a semiconductor plant.
The expansion building is compliant with the Sony Group’s global guidelines on building and equipment specifications, to reduce fire risk. For example, the building features an NFPA* compliant high- sensitivity smoke detection system and sprinklers, non-flammable exterior walls and exhaust ducts, and fire barrier walls between distribution transformers, for early fire detection and protection against the spread of fire.
* The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) is a US-based organization that develops standards for fire prevention.

Information Security. 
Like many companies, Sony faces increasingly sophisticated cybersecurity threats, so the importance of information security continues to grow. In recent years, malicious actors seeking to compromise the information of global companies continue to grow in number, and their attack methods are becoming more advanced.
To address this situation and ensure that Sony continues to earn customers’ trust, Sony maintains and enhances a robust information security program. Led by the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO),
Sony’s information security program is grounded in a company-wide governance structure. Sony manages potential risks effectively, incorporates security controls into systems and products to safeguard information, trains officers, employees and business partners to understand how their actions can introduce information security risk, and deploys 24/7 monitoring and response capabilities to swiftly address attacks.
Information Security Governance. 
Sony’s information security program is governed by a set of global policies and standards based on internationally accepted industry best practices. These policies set forth Sony’s commitment to information security and define practices and procedures to be followed by Sony executives and employees to help protect information resources and information systems from unauthorized access, leakage, falsification, loss, destruction, and other security risks. Sony routinely reviews and revises these policies and standards to address changes in the risk landscape, threats, and the regulatory environment. The CISO monitors the global implementation of and compliance with those policies.
The CISO’s office coordinates with the executive information security officers (EISOs) responsible for information security at Sony group companies to create a group-wide information security management system. These officers ensure effective implementation of policies and standards.
Strong Board of Directors and executive support for, and governance of, information security is essential. The Board of Directors and Senior. 
Executives of Sony Group Corporation are regularly informed of cybersecurity risk and information security program activities. The. 
Directors of Sony Group Corporation in charge of information security review information security activities frequently, and the CISO briefs the full Board of Directors regularly on the activities. Senior Executives of Sony Group Corporation and senior managements of respective group companies also review security activities regularly and play an active role in managing risks within their respective organizations and work to instill a culture of security awareness in all employees.
Sony group companies have set up information security management committees to fulfill this responsibility.
Employee Training as a Key Component of Information Security. 
Every employee has a critical role to play in protecting Sony’s most sensitive information. To increase Sony employees’ awareness of information security threats, Sony requires all personnel to receive annual information security training, where they learn how to report incidents and study the types of behaviors they must avoid in order to reduce risk. Sony employees also regularly receive phishing awareness training, which tests employees’ knowledge of how to spot and avoid cyber-attacks delivered through fraudulent emails.
Monitoring and Response Measures. 
Sony has a 24/7 global security operations center equipped with advanced technical capabilities to prevent and manage information security incidents. Sony’s incident response team defends the company’s information infrastructure by using threat intelligence and analysis, monitoring and detection of malicious activity, rapid response and containment, and sophisticated forensics capabilities.
Strengthening Measures Against New Threats. 
Sony is committed to safeguarding the trust of customers, employees against threat regarding information security and business partners.
Sony continuously looks for ways to improve practices, implement stronger controls, and provide more robust security against new threats, all in order to protect the personal data information entrusted to its care. To do this, Sony employs and invests in a workforce of information security professionals and subject matter experts.
Semiconductor Manufacturing Site: Deployment of. 
Earthquake Motion Prediction System. 
In 2018, Sony Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation completed the deployment of an earthquake motion detection system for its main business sites. The system detects initial P waves (primary waves) from earthquakes and uses the data to predict the magnitude of subsequent S waves (secondary waves). If necessary, critical semiconductor manufacturing equipment is shut down before S waves reach the site, protecting equipment and products. Since the system can also predict epicentral earthquakes, a network of Sony’s business sites and its peripheral observation points is operated to improve response times and enhance prediction accuracy.
Semiconductor Manufacturing Site:
Initiatives against Flood Damage. 
Sony Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation carries out disaster impact assessments for each of its manufacturing sites, based on simulations etc. of assumed risks of flood damage. It is gradually deploying measures such as the installation of water stops to mitigate damage at critical facilities.

Transactional taxes such as VAT and sales taxes, Customs Duty,
Employment Taxes and others are the ultimate responsibility of the relevant divisional Finance Director for each business. The GTO has strong links with these divisional Finance Directors to ensure that in the event of material risks being identified or errors made, the GTO provides support including where necessary liaising with the relevant tax authority.
Approach to Tax Planning. 
Sony operates diverse businesses within a complex global environment, in which tax is an important factor. Sony believes in taking a principled and responsible approach to managing its tax affairs, in line with business objectives and operations. Sony does not engage in transactions where the sole aim is to achieve tax avoidance or profit shifting which are against the spirit of tax laws. The tax function provides appropriate input as part of the approval process for business proposals to ensure the tax consequences are clearly understood. Sony is committed to fulfilling its obligation both to comply with applicable tax laws and to safeguard Sony’s reputation.
The jurisdictions in which Sony does business may offer various tax incentives such as enhanced deductions, credits and exemptions for certain types of income and expense to meet local policy objectives such as encouraging inward investment. Sony Group Corporation believes it has a duty to its shareholders to take advantage of such incentives where they are generally available to all taxpayers who meet the relevant criteria and the requirements to claim the incentive do not conflict with broader business objectives.
Tax Risks. 
Sony employs diligent professional care and judgement in assessing tax risk, and may take advice from third-party specialists and where appropriate consult with or obtain rulings from relevant tax authorities to support the decision-making process. However, tax law is not always clear and unambiguous, and differences in interpretation can arise. Sony monitors its tax positions closely and will not record an accounting benefit unless it determines based on consideration of the facts and the law that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained.
Dealings with Tax Authorities. 
Sony seeks to maintain good professional relationships with tax authorities. When providing responses to Tax Authority questions, all responses are based on an honest and accurate representation of the facts as Sony understands them.
Transparency.

Sony’s policy regarding shareholdings of listed companies (excluding Sony’s subsidiaries), and its policy for exercising voting rights are as follows:
Policy regarding shareholdings of listed companies. 
Shareholding policy. 
Sony Group Corporation and its subsidiaries decide whether to acquire or continue to hold shares of listed companies (excluding the acquisition and holding of shares by Sony Group Corporation’s listed subsidiaries, and Sony Group Corporation’s shareholding in its own listed subsidiaries) based on an appropriate examination of each investment, and choose to engage in such shareholding only if it is judged to meet Sony’s business purposes and to have sufficient economic rationale. If it is determined that investments do not meet these criteria, Sony Group Corporation and its subsidiaries will avoid or reduce exposure to such holdings.
Assessment of rationale for shareholding. 
In all cases where Sony Group Corporation and its subsidiaries hold shares in listed companies (excluding shares held by Sony Group. 
Corporation’s listed subsidiaries, and Sony Group Corporation’s shareholdings in its own listed subsidiaries) for reasons other than for the sole purpose of investment, Sony Group Corporation carries out a timely review to assess the rationale for shareholding, the importance of Sony’s business relationship with each company whose shares it holds (taking into account the progress of, and outlook for, any anticipated business collaboration between Sony and said company) , and any anticipated positive impact of such shareholdings on Sony’s business relationship with the company. In addition, Sony Group Corporation also assesses the appropriateness of these shareholdings by considering the potential of each investment to contribute to mid- and long-term value creation in. 
Sony, via an assessment of expected return on investment and cost of capital. These evaluations are first carried out on the management side, after which the Board, which is responsible for overseeing business operation, carries out its own assessment based on the result of the evaluations by the management side.
Details of the assessment carried out by the Board of Directors. 
Based on the above policy, at the Board meeting held on June 28, 2022, Sony Group Corporation carried out an assessment of the rationale for its and its subsidiaries’ shareholdings in listed companies (excluding shares held by Sony Group Corporation’s listed subsidiaries, and Sony’s shareholdings in its own listed subsidiaries) as of March 31, 2022. As a result of the assessment, it was determined that Sony should consider reducing its exposure to certain holdings, which were concluded to be reduced in such review.
Policy for exercising voting rights. 
Sony Group Corporation believes in the importance of enhancing the corporate value of the listed companies whose shares it holds, and. 
Sony Group Corporation’s own corporate value in turn, through the exercise of its voting rights. Accordingly, Sony aims to exercise its voting rights with the intention of increasing each company’s mid- to long-term corporate value, after a comprehensive consideration of both the significance and economic rationale of its shareholdings, and the details of proposals. For example, Sony Group Corporation has established internal rules determining what factors should be taken into account when considering proposals about matters such as the appropriation of retained earnings, the appointment of directors, statutory auditors and accounting auditors, as well as shareholder proposals. Through these rules, Sony Group Corporation makes appropriate decisions regarding the exercise of its voting rights.
Business relations with companies who invest in Sony Group Corporation. 
Should a company who holds shares of Sony Group Corporation’s stock express the intention to sell such shares, Sony Group Corporation will not attempt to obstruct such sale by threatening to limit business transactions with said company, and will not engage in any transactions that would harm the common interests of the company or its shareholders.
Anti-Hostile-Takeover Measures. 
Sony Group Corporation has not adopted any anti-hostile takeover measures. Sony Group Corporation will fully examine the necessity and rationale with respect to the adoption or implementation of anti- hostile takeover measures with the Board and/or the Audit Committee and once complete, will provide sufficient explanation to shareholders.

Environmental Data Collection Methods and Rationale. 
Scope, Collection Period, and Accuracy of Compiled Data. 
Collection Period: Thursday, April 1, 2021-Thursday, March 31, 2022. 
In principle, data for results was compiled in the period stated above.
Estimates have been used, however, at some sites where the impact on overall results is deemed to be extremely minor.
Scope of Data Collection. 
Site data. 
All ISO 14001-certified sites as of March 31, 2022. Among Sony Group consolidated sites, all manufacturing sites, distribution sites with 100 or more employees, and non-manufacturing sites with 1,000 or more employees are, in principle, expected to obtain ISO 14001 certification.
Product data. 
Data covers all products manufactured by the Sony Group and sold outside the Group. Accessories, semi-manufactured products and components are included. Weight data includes the weight of packaging materials.
Data Accuracy. 
Site data. 
Chemical substance data and environmental cost data collected from certain sites may be slightly less accurate than other data.
Product Data. 
Data for some semi-manufactured products, components, and some products produced and sold overseas may be slightly less accurate than other data.
Greenhouse Gas Related Data Collection Methods and Rationale. 
Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Sites. 
Calculated based on energy-related emissions (power, heat, and fuel usage) and non energy-related emissions(used for manufacturing processes, facilities) from sites.
CO2 emissions from energy consumption (energy-related)
CO2 emissions from energy consumption are calculated by multiplying the quantity of electrical power, heat and fuel (including fuel for motor vehicles, etc.) used at sites by the CO2 conversion rate.
For energy consumption using renewable energy including certificates, the CO2 conversion rate is zero.
Emissions of PFCs and other greenhouse gases (non energy-related)
Emissions of PFCs and other greenhouse gases are converted to CO2 by multiplying greenhouse gas emissions from each site by global warming potentials.
Global warming potentials are based on the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
CO2 conversion rates [Electricity]
Japan: Latest rate published each year by contracted power companies.
Outside Japan: Latest rate published each year by contracted power companies or that for the relevant country/region.
[Fuel and Heat]
Worldwide: Rates based on Japan’s Law concerning the Promotion of the Measures to cope with Global Warming. 
Renewable Electricity Rate. 
Renewable energy includes using electrical power generated from renewable energy sources, purchasing electrical power produced from renewable energy sources, and purchasing renewable energy certificates and other carbon offset credits. Renewable electricity rates are calculated by the following equation.
Renewable electricity rate = renewable electricity consumption ÷ total consumption of sites × 100. 
Total CO2 Emissions from Product Use. 
CO2 emissions from product use are calculated by multiplying the quantity of estimated electrical power consumed throughout the lifetime of products sold in the current fiscal year by the CO2 conversion rates. (In other words, it is not the actual quantity of CO2 emitted in the current fiscal year.) CO2 emissions from product use are calculated by the following equation.
In theory, CO2 emissions during product use in the current fiscal year should be calculated from the total quantity of electrical power consumed by previously sold Sony products that are still in use by consumers in the current fiscal year. However, given the difficulty of determining how many previously sold Sony products are still in use by consumers of the total number of Sony products sold to date,
Sony uses the estimated total quantity of electrical power consumed while in use over the lifetime of Sony products sold in the current fiscal year to calculate CO2 emissions during use.
The hours of operation per year, standby time per year, and years of product use are calculated based on data obtained by various surveys. In Japan, Sony uses the latest CO2 conversion rate provided by the Electric Power Council for a Low Carbon Society. Outside of. 
Japan, it uses country or region-specific CO2 conversion rates provided by the International Energy Agency (IEA).
Operating power consumption × hours of operation per year + × × ×
Power consumption during standby × standby time per year.

CO2 Emissions from Logistics. 
Total CO2 emissions from logistics include emissions arising from international logistics and logistics within regions such as Japan, the. 
United States, Europe, and Asia associated with Sony Group’s electronics products. For logistics within Japan, CO2 emissions from parts logistics are partially included.
CO2 emissions from logistics are primarily calculated by multiplying ton-kilometers transported (weight of goods transported x distance traveled) by the CO2 conversion rate. In certain instances, CO2 emissions arising from transport by truck are calculated by multiplying the amount of fuel used (fuel consumption per kilometer x number of kilometers traveled) by the CO2 conversion rate. For international transport by ship, the calculation uses the weight of goods transported including the weight of shipping containers.
For international transport, the CO2 conversion rate used to calculate. 
CO2 emissions is based on the emissions intensity supplied by the GHG. 
Protocol. For regional transport, priority is given to using the rate supplied by the region or country. For Japanese domestic transport by truck, CO2 emissions calculations multiply the weight of freight transported by two factors: the amount of fuel used per unit of freight transported, as defined in the Law concerning the Rational Use of Energy, and the emissions factor of fuel type used, as defined by the Law concerning the Promotion of Measures to Cope with Global. 
Warming. For transport in the United States, Sony uses the emissions rate supplied by the SmartWay Transport Partnership, which is administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
CO2 Emissions from Employee Business Trips. 
Emissions are calculated for business trips undertaken by employees in central departments, which account for the largest share of business trips taken by employees of Sony Group Corporation and. 
Sony Group Electronics Business companies in Japan, Europe and. 
North America and for business trips taken by employees from some electronics-related companies in Asia (In the case of Japan and North. 
America, some music-related companies are included). CO2 emissions are calculated by multiplying the distance traveled by the number of employees traveling using the basic unit of output by class type proposed by the GHG Protocol.
Category Overview of Calculation. 
Category 1 Purchased goods and services. 
Emissions associated with raw materials and parts for use in electronics products sold by and the goods purchased by the Sony Group, from the extraction of resources through to production, as well as emissions related to certain data center use.
Category 2 Capital goods Emissions associated with the production of capital goods invested in by the Sony Group.
Category 3. 
Fuel- and energy-related activities (not included in scope 1 or scope 2)
Emissions associated with procurement of fuels and energy consumed by Sony Group sites.
Category 4 Upstream transportation and distribution. 
Emissions associated with the transportation and storage of electronics products sold by the Sony Group and purchased parts.
Category 5 Waste generated in operations Emissions associated with the treatment and disposal of waste generated by Sony Group sites.
Category 6 Business travel Emissions associated with travel (by air) for business purposes by Sony Group electronics group companies employees, mainly in Japan, Europe, and North America.
Category 7 Employee commuting Emissions associated with employees’ commutes from their homes to their workplace.
Category 8 Upstream leased assets Not applicable (accounted for in other categories)
Category 9 Downstream transportation and distribution.
