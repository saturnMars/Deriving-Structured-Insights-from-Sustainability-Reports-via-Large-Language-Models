A MESSAGE FROM OUR CEO —— Edison International is at the forefront of the clean energy transition. Our vision is to lead the transformation of the electric power industry in a way that is safe, reliable and affordable for all our customers. While the road ahead is long, I’m proud of the meaningful progress our 13,000 team members from Edison International, SCE and Edison Energy1 made in 2021 to advance our clean energy strategy and provide value to our stakeholders.
Climate Change. 
We remain committed to the global fight against climate change. In 2021, our Mind the Gap policy paper underscored actions needed in California to meet the state’s 2030 climate commitments. Building electrification was highlighted as a gap, and SCE subsequently proposed investing $677 million to support the installation of 250,000 electric heat pumps over the next four years. SCE also continued to execute its $800 million transportation electrification program, launching the second phase of Charge Ready for light-duty passenger vehicles. Last June, Edison International and SCE received one of the industry’s highest honors, the Edison Electric Institute’s (EEI) Edison Award, for transportation electrification advancement.
I was proud to lead Edison International’s delegation at the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) and encouraged by the increased commitment and urgency. 
I heard from international, national, state and business leaders. In 2021, Edison International extended our climate commitment to net-zero GHG emissions across Scopes 1, 2 and 3 by 2045 in alignment with economywide climate actions planned by the State of California.
SCE is adapting its system to the threat of climate change, including grid hardening in the near term to protect against wildfires. SCE recently published the first climate adaptation vulnerability assessment by a California investor-owned utility, with risks projected out to 2070. Meanwhile, Edison Energy advised 22 of the Fortune 100 to support corporate customers’ renewable energy and sustainability goals in the U.S. and internationally.
Reliability & Affordability. 
SCE invests more than $5 billion annually to improve grid resiliency and maintain the safe delivery of clean power. In 2021, SCE announced the planned addition of 535 MW of battery storage at three strategically located substations to enhance grid reliability.
With approximately one-third of customers on an income-assisted rate, SCE works to maintain affordable services for all. While customers are experiencing near-term rate increases, SCE’s system average rate is the lowest among large investor-owned utilities in California. Looking ahead, SCE’s work to modernize the grid and expand access to electric technologies is expected to reduce the average household's cost of energy consumption, including natural gas and gasoline expenses, by one-third by 2045.
Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DEI)
Edison International takes pride in building an inclusive, equitable work environment and reflecting and participating in the communities we serve. In 2021, more than 80% of our shareholder-funded charitable contributions went to organizations and initiatives focused on diverse and underserved communities. Among our 10 DEI commitments, we selected the first awardees for a lineworker scholarship to diversify our talent pipeline, with the opportunity for employment following successful program completion.
We’re committed to supporting our stakeholders and look forward to our continued partnerships in the year ahead.

With its headquarters and primary footprint in California, Edison International has aligned its climate commitment with California’s statewide climate goals and aims to achieve net-zero GHG emissions across Scopes 1, 2 and 3 by 2045. This commitment covers the power SCE delivers to customers and Edison International’s enterprisewide operations, including our supply chain. As part of this commitment, SCE aims to deliver 100% carbon-free power to customers in terms of retail sales by 2045.
Edison International is also focused on enabling emissions reductions across other sectors through adoption of electric technologies connected to a clean power grid. Analyses of ours and others show electrification of transportation and buildings, coupled with the use of low-carbon fuels for technologies not viable for electrification, is the most affordable path to a net-zero GHG emissions economy and can help reduce customers' overall energy costs over the long term.
Edison Energy1 works with clients globally to respond to climate challenges by helping them structure renewable energy projects, electrify their fleets, develop energy optimization programs and set comprehensive sustainability strategies inclusive of net-zero goals and science-based targets.
1 Edison Energy is not the same company as Southern California Edison, the utility, and Edison Energy is not regulated by the California Public Utilities Commission.
CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION —— Edison International is a nationally recognized leader in the clean energy transition. Our principal subsidiary, SCE, delivers power to customers entirely within the state of California, which has some of the most ambitious science-based climate change goals in the U.S. These goals include net-zero GHG emissions economywide by 2045 and net-negative emissions thereafter, along with a 40% reduction in statewide GHG emissions from 1990 levels by 2030 and 80% by 2050.
SCE’s Long History of Clean Energy Action. 
For more than 50 years, SCE has accelerated the addition of renewable energy to the grid and the innovation needed to enable a two-way power flow that supports customer-sited clean energy resources, such as rooftop solar. Today we maintain one of the cleanest electricity mixes in the nation (see 2021 Power Mix for SCE Customers). As far back as the 1970s, SCE has undertaken research to address the environmental impact of traditional power generation and to understand the viability of renewable energy, while initiating customer conservation programs to encourage efficient electricity use. In the 1980s, SCE built two thermal solar plants in the Mojave Desert in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Energy and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power.
California required SCE and other investorowned utilities to divest the majority of their generation assets beginning in the late 1990s in order to promote competitive energy pricing. Among other things, SCE divested from and terminated all contracts with coal-burning resources and, since 2015, has had no coal in its specified portfolio. Today, SCE is wires-focused, with less than 20% of electricity sales coming from SCE's own generating facilities.
In the early 2000s, SCE began to sign large, long-term contracts with third-party developers for wind and solar resources and built the nation’s first transmission line designed to carry renewable power. We continue to honor our long-term commitment to bringing renewable energy to customers with the completion of SCE’s West of Devers Project in 2021. This upgrade is expected to enable the development of thousands of megawatts of renewable energy and battery storage resources in the desert areas in the eastern part of SCE's service. 
To minimize environmental impact in the West of Devers Project, SCE removed and replaced conductors and supporting structures within a corridor containing existing transmission lines. The corridor spans several communities within Riverside and San Bernardino counties, as well as the reservation trust land of the Morongo Band of Mission Indians.

The state of California is also a leader in energy efficiency programs, policies and standards that have reduced the need for new fossil-fuel burning generation assets. SCE’s decoupled rate structure means our financial results are not affected by changes in electricity sales. SCE has exceeded its state-mandated energy efficiency targets year-over-year for the past decade.
Thought Leadership. 
Since 2017, SCE has published policy papers outlining our analysis, recommendations and the cross-sector collaboration needed to achieve California’s climate goals. SCE’s first policy paper, Clean Power and Electrification Pathway, published in 2017, presented an integrated blueprint for California to reduce GHG emissions and air pollutants by 2030. In 2019, Pathway 2045 expanded this analysis to reflect the state’s new net zero goal and identified five key actions to affordably achieve net zero GHG emissions economywide by 2045. Both Pathway papers examined multiple scenarios to achieve the state’s climate goals and found a high-electrification scenario to be the most affordable pathway. In 2020, Reimagining the Grid assessed the grid changes needed to support California’s climate goals, while adapting to evolving customer and climate change-driven needs.

In 2021, Edison International published Mind the Gap: Policies for California’s Countdown to 2030, highlighting the accelerated rate of annual GHG emissions reductions needed across the California economy to achieve the state’s 2030 climate goals. The report recommends state and federal policies and funding mechanisms to close the gap between the state’s current trajectory and the performance required. Building electrification is shown as one of the key opportunities, along with a continued focus on transportation electrification and decarbonization of the electric power grid.
In 2022, Edison International extended its thought leadership to climate adaptation, publishing Adapting for Tomorrow: Powering a Resilient Future.

Climate Action. 
Edison International supports collaborative efforts to address climate change. In April 2021, we joined a coalition of companies led by the We Mean Business Coalition and Ceres to urge President Biden to set a strong U.S. climate goal of at least a 50% reduction in GHG emissions by 2030. We are pleased to see the resulting commitment aligned with this effort. We have since supported two additional letters (July 2021 and February 2022) to the U.S. Congress calling for clean infrastructure investments organized by the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions (C2ES). In February 2022, Edison International CEO Pedro Pizarro and other utility executives met with President Biden to advocate for action on climate change.
CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION (CONTINUED) ——
For more details on Edison International’s approach to advancing our climate change agenda, see Climate Change Mitigation: Additional Details and Political Activities. 
Over the course of 2021, Edison International successfully advocated in support of billions of dollars of federal funding for electric technologies that promote the transition to a decarbonized economy. We were particularly pleased to see support for new programs that support electric buses and the buildout of electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure as key provisions of the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.
Additionally, we continued our support of strong federal and state policies to provide for an equitable transition to a decarbonized economy. This includes the policies outlined in our Mind the Gap policy paper, such as incentives for EVs and strict vehicle emissions standards, as well as an increase to the pace of generation interconnection to expedite the availability of renewable energy on the grid.

CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION (CONTINUED) —— Strategic Investments and Innovation. 
SCE expects to invest more than $5 billion annually in our electric power grid, driven by investments in safety and reliability. We also collaborate across the industry and with government agencies to advance technologies that support decarbonization of the power supply and the capabilities needed to support the shift toward EVs and all-electric buildings. We are particularly focused on grid-related technologies, such as energy storage and predictive analytics to support the clean energy transition, given our wires-focused business model and small utility generation footprint. In the near term, we are also investing in and deploying new technologies to further reduce the threat of wildfires associated with or impacting our system.
SCE is a key sponsor of the Low-Carbon Resources Initiative (LCRI), an industrywide initiative led by the Electric Power Research Institute and Gas Technology Institute to accelerate development and demonstration of key technologies needed beyond 2030 to get to a net zero economy. The five-year, $250 million-plus effort is focused on opportunity areas for decarbonization, such as renewable fuels, hydrocarbon-based processes, and delivery and storage. In 2021, LCRI launched a low-carbon hydrogen accelerator to support startups focused on advancing low-carbon hydrogen production, among other things.
Beyond SCE’s investments, Edison International makes targeted strategic investments in, and develops collaborations with, early-stage companies focused on innovative clean energy technologies and services supporting our strategy.
Edison International has made multiple investments aimed at helping accelerate the transition to electric transportation. We were an early investor in Proterra, manufacturer of electric buses; AMPLY Power, a provider of a fully managed charging-as-a-service model; and ViriCiti, a provider of monitoring solutions for electric fleets. In 2021, Proterra successfully listed on the Nasdaq, while AMPLY and ViriCiti were acquired by BP and ChargePoint, respectively. Most recently, we invested in Forum Mobility, which is developing turnkey electrification solutions for heavy-duty truck fleets that transport goods from ports.
We have also made investments related to the grid of the future, clean energy and operational excellence. For example, Edison International is an investor in Element Energy, which is developing technologies to improve the safety and performance of batteries. In addition, we invested in Heliogen, which is developing renewable energy technology that aims to cost-effectively deliver near-24/7 carbon-free energy in the form of heat, power or green hydrogen fuel. In late 2021, Heliogen began trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Our most recent investment was in AiDash, which uses satellite imagery and artificial intelligence to enhance vegetation management programs and improve other operations activities for utility and energy customers.
Carbon Footprint. 
Our GHG emissions inventory covers Edison International, SCE and Edison Energy1. We account for GHG emissions using The Climate Registry’s General Reporting Protocol and the sector-specific reporting protocol for the Electric Power Sector. Edison International's and Edison Energy's emissions are de minimis compared to SCE's emissions.
Scope 1 emissions represent an estimated 8% of our enterprisewide footprint. Scope 1 includes emissions from SCE's utility-owned generation, as well as emissions related to our transportation fleet, stationary combustion for backup generators and building heating, and fugitives such as sulfur hexafluoride (SF6). In 2021, 80% of Scope 1 emissions came from SCE’s combined cycle natural gas plant, Mountainview, which is covered under California’s cap-andtrade market. Our Scope 1 emissions declined an estimated 29% from 2020 due to Mountainview’s less frequent economic dispatch by the California Independent System Operator.

1 In 2021, SCE updated its “retail sales” accounting to net out excess generation stemming from net-energy metering customers who generate power through rooftop solar and sell the excess back to the grid. This reduces. 
SCE’s retail sales by approximately 3% and has the downstream effect of reducing, from an accounting perspective, the amount of “unspecified” energy SCE purchases on behalf of customers and those associated emissions. It also increases, from an accounting perspective, the proportion of specified resources, such as RPS-eligible energy, in SCE’s retail sales. This updated approach more accurately reflects the load served and power purchased on behalf of and sold to SCE customers. Prior year emissions metrics have not been updated, however, and thus a year-over-year comparison is not feasible for Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions.
2 Edison International and SCE supply chain emissions have been estimated using the spend-based method, which multiplies the economic value of goods and services purchases by average emissions factors for each relevant industry. The estimates are 0.7 MMT CO2e and 0.9 MMT CO2e for 2020 and 2021, respectively.
3 Inventory excludes certain miniscule sources, such as refrigerants related to air conditioning systems that are too small to be captured in SCE’s air quality compliance reporting or emissions from certain specialized vehicle rentals, which we estimate to be miniscule and permitted for exclusion pursuant to The Climate Registry’s GHG emissions reporting protocols.
4 Scope 1 emissions are direct emissions under the control of the company, including utility-owned generation (89%), stationary and mobile combustion (<1% and 7%, respectively) and fugitives, such as SF6 from transmission and distribution (T&D) operations (4%).
5 Scope 2 emissions are indirect emissions required for business processes, including average market-based and location-based facility electricity (<5%) and T&D line losses (96%).
6 Scope 3 emissions are realized as a consequence of our activities, including specified and unspecified power purchases to serve SCE customers (92%), Edison International and SCE's supply chain (8%), and enterprisewide employee commuting and business travel (<1%). Our Scope 3 emissions inventory continues to evolve with the new addition of emissions from Edison International and SCE's supply chain, as well as Edison Energy's 9 business travel and employee commuting.
7 Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions for 2020 have been updated from 1.5 MMT CO2e to 1.4 MMT CO2e, 0.7 MMT CO2e to 0.8 MMT CO2e and 11.3 MMT CO2e to 11.9 MMT CO2e, respectively, to reflect final purchased power data from SCE's 2020 Power Source Disclosure Program (PSDP) filing, which was finalized and submitted after the preparation of the 2020 Sustainability Report, as well as use of other refined data inputs in the inventory. 2020 Scope 3 emissions calculation update also includes the addition of emissions from Edison International and SCE’s supply chain2, as well as Edison Energy’s9 business travel and employee commuting (Edison International and SCE’s business travel and employee commuting were previously included). The 2020 figures for Scope 1 and 2 also now included Edison Energy's emissions.
8 Emissions calculations for 2021 are estimated and include as an input an estimate of SCE's 2021 delivered power mix using the methodology prescribed by the California Energy Commission's (CEC) PSDP as of April 2, 2022.
SCE’s final PSDP report will be filed with the CEC on June 1, 2022, and may include updates to the inputs used in these calculations. The proportion of line loss compared to delivered power in 2021 has also been estimated using 2020 as a proxy.

Scope 2 emissions represent an estimated 6% of our footprint and include line loss emissions from power SCE purchases from third parties and sells to customers. Scope 2 also includes facility electricity, though this is a comparatively small portion of our footprint. Scope 2 emissions declined an estimated 4% from 2020. This appears to be due to normal operational variability associated with SCE’s purchased power mix. An update to SCE’s accounting of “retail sales” for its 2021 power mix may have also caused downward pressure on the line loss emissions estimate when compared to prior years. This is from an accounting perspective only.1. 
Scope 3 emissions comprise the majority of our footprint, an estimated 87%, and largely relate to the power SCE purchases from third parties and sells to customers. Our Scope 3 inventory includes, for the first time in 2021, an estimate.

We continue to report our business travel and employee commute emissions in Scope 3 of our 2020 and 2021 inventories.
In 2021, our Scope 3 emissions declined 3% compared to 2020. The reduction appears to be predominantly due to normal operational variability associated with SCE’s purchased power mix. An update to SCE’s accounting of “retail sales” for its 2021 power mix may have also caused downward pressure on the estimated emissions when compared to prior years. This is from an accounting perspective only.1 We expect our Scope 3 emissions to decline substantially over the next two decades as Pathway 2045 is realized.

CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION (CONTINUED) —— 2021 Power Mix for SCE Customers. 
In 2021, 43% of the power SCE delivered to customers is estimated to have come from carbon-free sources, including RPS-eligible resources such as wind and solar, along with other carbon-free sources such as large hydroelectric and nuclear power. In 2021, SCE’s estimated delivered power mix emitted approximately 45% fewer GHG emissions.

per unit of electricity compared to the latest available U.S. national average.1. 
SCE's performance in terms of proportion of carbon-free power in its delivered power mix was similar between 2020 and 2021. SCE updated the methodology used to account for retail sales in 2021, to more accurately reflect load served and power purchased on behalf of and sold to SCE customers, however, which makes it difficult to compare year-over-year performance.2 We estimate that, under the old methodology, SCE's performance may have shown a slight percentage point decline compared to prior-year performance. This would be due to normal operational variability, and SCE remains well-positioned to meet our 2030 and 2045 RPS and carbon-free power goals and interim targets.
1 U.S. national average available through the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Emissions and Generation Resource Integrated Database (eGRID) for data year 2020 is 822.6 lbs. CO2e/MWh or 0.37 MT CO2e/MWh.
2 In 2021, SCE updated its “retail sales” accounting to net out excess generation stemming from net-energy metering customers who generate power through rooftop solar and sell the excess back to the grid. This reduces SCE’s retail sales by approximately 3% and has the downstream effect of reducing, from an accounting perspective, the amount of “unspecified” energy SCE purchases on behalf of customers and those associated emissions. It also increases, from an accounting perspective, the proportion of specified resources, such as RPS-eligible energy, in SCE’s retail sales. This updated approach more accurately reflects the load served and power purchased on behalf of and sold to SCE customers. Prior year power mix and emissions metrics have not been updated, however, and a year-over-year comparison is not feasible.
3 This is an estimate of SCE’s 2021 delivered power mix using the methodology prescribed by the CEC's PSDP as of April 2, 2022. SCE’s final PSDP report will be filed with the CEC on June 1, 2022 and may include data that differs from the estimate shown here to reflect subsequent changes or clarifications to PSDP's methodology and reporting template. Numbers do not sum due to rounding.
4 "Other" consists of diesel and liquefied petroleum gas from SCE-owned Pebbly Beach Generating Station on Catalina Island.
5 Unspecified power refers to electricity that is not traceable to a specific generating facility, such as electricity traded through open market transactions administered by the California Independent System Operator (CAISO). The power is typically a mix of resources, largely dominated by natural gas and renewables. The generating resources in the CAISO market are getting cleaner as more renewables are added to the grid in line with California state law. Unspecified power also consists of energy from out-of-state wind projects that are not delivered into California. This energy is considered RPS-eligible for RPS compliance purposes, however. See Delivered Power Mix & GHG Emissions: Additional Information.
6 2020 delivered power mix data reflects final data from SCE’s PSDP filing in June 2021, and has been updated from the estimate shown in the 2020 Sustainability Report. Update includes natural gas updated from 16% to 15%.
7 The proportion of natural gas in SCE’s delivered power mix increased in 2021 compared to 2020 due to the addition of two tolling agreements with third-party natural gas generators. The addition of these agreements, which also resulted in a decrease in SCE's procurement of market-based, unspecified energy, was done as a normal course of business to optimize SCE’s portfolio to meet reliability, cost and renewable energy compliance objectives.

Path to Net Zero. 
Edison International is committed to achieving net-zero GHG emissions across Scopes 1, 2 and 3 by 2045.1 GHG emissions stemming from the power SCE sells to customers comprise the majority (87% excluding line losses) of Edison International’s enterprisewide emissions inventory. Thus, a major component of our plan to achieve net-zero GHG emissions by 2045 is to deliver 100% carbon-free power to SCE customers by 2045. This goal is a statutory requirement in California and is supported by interim renewable energy compliance requirements through 2030. SCE has also set an interim carbon-free power target of 80% by 2030, which exceeds our renewable energy compliance requirement, and we have been advocating for the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) to authorize this target. SCE is investing heavily in energy storage and the grid-related capabilities needed to deliver high levels of intermittent renewable resources. We believe we can meet this carbon-free power target using technology that exists today.
SCE’s 100% carbon-free power target and California’s statutory requirement are both on a “retail sales” basis, which excludes, from an accounting perspective, power generation lost via transmission and distribution. This leaves a small amount of headroom for natural gas to serve as back-up power during high heat, peak load days or in case of emergency in 2045.
This could come from SCE-owned natural gas resources (Scope 1) and/or power purchased from third-party generators (Scope 3). All electricity generators in California that emit over 25,000 MTCO2e annually are covered under the state’s cap-and-trade program, including SCE's Mountainview combined cycle plant. All other electricity generators are also included in California’s statewide GHG emissions inventory and thus any remaining emissions from natural gas power plants in 2045 will need to be offset or removed to meet the state’s economywide net-zero GHG emissions goal. Edison International is collaborating with peer utilities through LCRI to advance potential solutions.
We anticipate that the remaining 13% of emissions across our enterprise will decline substantially over the next two decades as California and other jurisdictions enact policies to meet economywide climate goals. Policies already enacted in California support electrification and decarbonization of our transportation fleet and facilities and the phase-out of SF6, a high global warmingpotential gas, from SCE’s transmission and distribution equipment. In addition, we are exploring voluntary actions to accelerate the pace of change. SCE has set its own voluntary targets to electrify its transportation fleet and is exploring ways to engage its supply chain in decarbonization efforts.

Our approach to addressing climate change focuses on adaptation in addition to mitigation. As we have experienced firsthand in California, the effects of climate change have become undeniable. Both the public and private sectors must plan to adapt to the challenges climate change brings. With a focus on vulnerable communities, SCE is working to coordinate medium- and long-term actions and associated investments across sectors to optimize the societal benefits of adaptation planning. In the near term, we continue to adapt our system to the threat of climate change-driven wildfires.
CLIMATE ADAPTATION ——
Long-Term Assessment. 
In May 2022, SCE made public a climate adaptation vulnerability assessment (CAVA), which evaluates the potential long-term impacts of temperature, precipitation, sea level rise and wildfire hazards on our infrastructure and operations. The assessment uses 10 California-endorsed Global Climate Models as the best representation of climatic patterns and a conservative, high-emissions global warming scenario to ground this assessment. We also engaged with the community to inform the assessment, with a particular focus on our stakeholders in disadvantaged vulnerable communities (DVCs).1. 
Edison International's Adapting for Tomorrow: Powering a Resilient Future summarizes key takeaways including the types of vulnerabilities SCE, our customers and our communities could face. Findings include the need for climate adaptation investments over the next three decades, starting with no-regrets foundational measures now; the incorporation of future climate states into planning processes; a common level of understanding of climate change risks among communities and 1 Defined by the CPUC (D. 20-08-046, p. 119) as communities in the 25% highest scoring census tracts according to the most recent version of the California Communities Environmental Health Screening Tool (CalEnviroScreen), as well as all California tribal lands, census tracts with median household incomes less than 60% of state median income and census tracts that score in the highest 5% of Pollution Burden within CalEnviroScreen, but do not receive an overall CalEnviroScreen score due to unreliable public health and socioeconomic data.
SCE is piloting Early Fault Detection technology — devices that are installed on power poles and listen in on the electrical noise coursing through power lines — to help detect and mitigate against disruptions related to electrical infrastructure that could lead to wildfire hazards.
stakeholders; and significant collaboration between private and public sector stakeholders to perform cross-sector resiliency planning.
To support the CAVA, in 2021, SCE launched our Climate Resilience Leadership Group, a forum of community leaders working with SCE on a six-month engagement to collect local feedback from DVCs. The feedback helped SCE identify gaps in our thinking about local community resilience, and we included these insights the CAVA. For example, qualitative feedback collected from these engagements helped SCE adjust and improve quantitative metrics developed to assess how modifying our grid to address climate change impacts would impact surrounding communities. See Environmental & Social Justice: Additional Details for more information.
Near-Term Actions. 
In the near-term, SCE continues to adapt our system to the threat of climate change-driven wildfires. In total, approximately 2.5 million acres burned in California in 2021 — fewer acres than in 2020 but on par with 2019, a previously record-breaking year. In October 2021, a drought emergency was declared across California. Increasing temperatures and heightened drought conditions make areas much more vulnerable to wildfire, especially in high fire risk areas (HFRA), which comprise approximately 27% of SCE’s service area.
SCE continues to harden the electric grid to ensure safety, grid resiliency and system.

readiness for these growing climate change impacts. We met or exceeded nearly all of our wildfire mitigation goals in 2021. We installed more than 1,500 circuit miles of covered conductor, bringing the total to more than 2,900 circuit miles that covers approximately 30% of our overhead distribution lines in HFRA.
Due to our wildfire mitigation efforts, we estimate that customers on the most frequently impacted circuits experienced 70% less public safety power shutoff (PSPS) outage time than they would have if the work had not been performed, based on 2021 weather and fuel conditions. Working with the modeling. 
CLIMATE ADAPTATION (CONTINUED) —— firm Risk Management Solutions, SCE estimates that as of year-end 2021 our wildfire mitigation efforts have reduced the probability of losses from catastrophic wildfire linked to SCE equipment by 65% to 70% since 2018, which shows improvement from a June 2021 estimate of 55% to 65%. Moreover, the PSPS contribution to total risk reduction declined from 40% to 30% between June 2021 and yearend, reflecting SCE's decreased dependency on PSPS as a mitigation measure.
SCE also continued to strengthen partnerships with state fire agencies, as well as academia and peer utilities, to advance wildfire defenses. In 2021, we supported the debut of the most.

effective water- and retardant-dropping helitankers in the world and the formation of the first-of-its-kind, quick-reaction aerial firefighting force. SCE contributed $18 million to Orange County Fire Authority (OCFA), Los Angeles Fire Department and Ventura County Fire Department for the lease of firefighting equipment, after successful partnerships with OCFA in 2019 and 2020. SCE also continued to collaborate with the International Wildfire Risk Mitigation Consortium, a group formed in 2020 between California investor-owned utilities and Australian utilities, to create a framework for utilities worldwide to jointly combat the global wildfire threat.
SCE is a key funder and technical lead to the newly created Cal Poly San Luis Obispo’s Wildland-Urban Interface Fire Information, Research and Education Institute. The institute, which is the first of its kind at a California university, is looking for holistic solutions to mitigate the consequences of wildland urban interface fires. Land where housing, commercial development and wildland areas meet is known as wildland urban interface. Fires in the wildland urban interface are the most frequent source of declared disasters in California and are becoming increasingly more frequent and damaging because of climate change and increased demand for housing in these areas.

ENVIRONMENTAL & SOCIAL JUSTICE —— Edison International is committed to doing our part to support communities that are particularly vulnerable to and face disproportionate economic, social, public health and other effects from climate change and other environmental hazards (“environmental and social justice,” or ESJ, communities) in building adaptative capacity. We believe that a transition to clean energy has the power to create a future full of socioeconomic benefits to all, and we are working hard to ensure that such a transition is just and inclusive.
Our approach to this just transition is focused on expanding access to jobs, training, programs and services to ESJ communities both at SCE and through Edison Energy’s1 client engagements. Given SCE’s wires-focused business model and Edison Energy’s focus on supporting customers in meeting their climate goals, we anticipate that the clean energy transition will continue to support our workforce. We have focused our efforts on building our diverse talent pipeline, in particular by expanding access to training for underrepresented talent and investing in SCE’s supplier diversity program. For more information see Leading with Diversity, Equity & Inclusion.
Beyond expanding economic benefits associated with clean energy-related work and contracting opportunities to underrepresented talent, SCE is focused on designing and implementing customer programs and services that provide clean energy benefits to ESJ communities. Supported by a strong commitment at the CPUC to include ESJ communities in its decision-making process, we have strengthened our ability in recent years to gather early input from ESJ communities and to apply it to our work, as well as to raise awareness within ESJ communities of clean energy opportunities.

ENVIRONMENTAL & SOCIAL JUSTICE (CONTINUED) ——
In 2021, many of SCE’s major programmatic accomplishments included significant planned investments in ESJ communities. For example, the launch of Charge Ready Light Duty (see Light-Duty Vehicles) included a requirement that 50% of all new installations are to be in disadvantaged communities. We also committed 75% of new Low-Carbon Fuel Standard-funded programs to ESJ communities, totaling more than $200 million over the next four years and expect to commit a similarly sized investment from this funding source in the second half of the decade. SCE has a similar focus in its building electrification programming, including running pilots in ESJ communities and proposing in the Building Electrification Application to dedicate about one-third of heat pump and 40% of electrical infrastructure program incentives in ESJ communities or to support incomequalified customers.
To inform this work, SCE engaged regularly with its Community Advisory Panel and Clean Energy Access Working Group (see Stakeholder Engagement). We also worked with the California Clean Fuel Reward program to determine best practices for engaging underserved communities in EV adoption. SCE engaged ESJ communities in preparing its climate adaptation vulnerability assessment (see Climate Adaptation).
Edison Energy1 is helping clients deploy impactful clean energy projects and programs that serve to uplift local communities. Because most of its clients want to be leaders in supporting a just and equitable clean energy transition, Edison Energy sees this as an opportunity to provide them with insights on how they can achieve equity across their energy strategies.
Providing Affordable Clean Energy Options to Residents in Disadvantaged Communities. 
SCE is implementing a residential building electrification pilot for households in three state of California-designated disadvantaged communities (DACs) —
California City, Ducor, and West Goshen — that lack access to natural gas and rely on propane or wood for cooking, space and water heating. The pilot offers to electrify end uses such as water heaters and cooking appliances. SCE aims to collect information and data to analyze the economic feasibility of potentially expanding the pilot to other DACs in the region.

Clean Energy. 
Edison International is a national leader in clean energy, with SCE focused on delivering 100% carbon-free power to customers by 2045 and Edison Energy1 supporting organizations globally in meeting their climate change goals through renewable energy contracts and electrification strategies.
As SCE prepares to deliver increasing levels of renewable and carbon-free power over the next two decades, improving energy storage is a primary focus, along with grid modernization. Batteries and other technologies can store excess energy from renewables and supply it to the grid later (e.g., when the sun isn’t shining or the wind isn’t blowing), thereby reducing dependence on natural gas-fueled power plants.

STRATEGIC FOCUS AREAS ——
SCE's Energy Storage Portfolio. 
With nearly 3,400 MW of energy storage installed or contracted, SCE has one of the largest energy-storage portfolios in the nation. In 2021 alone, SCE procured 530 MW of energy storage through three new contracts from third parties and entered into an engineering, procurement and construction agreement to construct approximately 535 MW of utility-owned storage. We anticipate approximately 1,000 MW of battery storage under contract with SCE and utility-owned will come online in 2022.
SCE’s energy-storage portfolio includes 1,360 MW of new co-located battery energy storage projects, wherein storage is added to existing solar resources. These co-located battery energy storage projects utilize lithium-ion battery technology. They are intended to mainly charge from a paired solar facility throughout the day and discharge energy to the grid in the evening when power needs peak and solar facilities are unable to generate. Co-located battery energy storage projects also have the potential to lower procurement costs and timelines because they are often located in proximity to a solar facility and use existing interconnection facilities and equipment.
help them reduce their carbon footprints and reach their own sustainability goals. Edison Energy has advised on more than 8,000 MW of renewable energy power purchase agreements (PPAs), including 1,475 MW of deals in 2021.
Edison Energy Advising European Companies on Sourcing Renewables. 
Since April 2021, Edison Energy’s European subsidiary, Altenex Energy, has been advising the companies Mars and Cargill on sourcing off-site renewable energy via PPAs in Germany, Poland, the Netherlands and Italy. Both companies are on the way to achieving their science-based sustainability targets. In particular, Altenex Energy expects these PPA deals to help Mars eliminate all fossil fuel use from its operations by 2040 and reduce its absolute Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions by 27% and 67% by 2025 and 2050, respectively. The contracts will help Cargill, a major.

Electrification. 
Significant electrification of transportation and buildings powered by carbon-free energy is the most feasible and affordable way to achieve California’s decarbonization goals. As California’s only investor-owned electric utility without a natural gas distribution business, SCE is uniquely positioned to advance electrification initiatives.
SCE’s approach is centered on accelerating customer adoption of electric technologies through innovative programs and researchbased incentives, as well as advocacy and cross- sector partnerships. SCE is also advancing our grid capabilities to handle the new demand for electricity that will come from devices that are not stationary (see Grid Modernization).
Through our transportation and building electrification programs, SCE is helping reduce the gaps identified by Edison International's Mind the Gap policy paper (see Thought Leadership). SCE’s Charge Ready Light Duty will support nearly one-third of the needed charging stations in apartments and public locations in SCE’s service area through the middle of the decade. SCE’s Charge Ready Transport has jumpstarted the commercial truck charging market and will support the initial conversion of approximately 8,500 vehicles through 2027. We are building new incentives, programs and processes to fill the remaining EV gap by 2030.
If approved, SCE's electric heat pump proposal (see Building Electrification) would fill approximately 15% of the electric heat pump shortage in SCE’s service area by 2030.
Edison International and SCE have continued our advocacy and support for policies and regulations that will help California lead the country in transportation electrification. Two important recent state actions include Governor Gavin Newsom’s executive order requiring in-state sales of all passenger vehicles to be zero emission by 2035 and the CARB Advanced Clean Trucks regulation, which requires truck manufacturers to transition to zero-emission trucks starting in 2024. SCE is engaged in CARB’s development of an Advanced Clean Fleet regulation to achieve zero-emission truck and bus fleets in California by 2045, and we have set our own fleet electrification goals.
Edison International and SCE continue to advocate for building electrification-related policies with state agencies, including advancing. 
Accelerating Charge Ready Schools Pilot. 
In addition to Charge Ready Light Duty,
SCE gained momentum on the Charge. 
Ready Schools pilot, a state-approved $10 million program to provide EV charging stations, including all necessary electrical infrastructure, to K-12 schools within our service area. In 2021, SCE installed 12 EV charging stations at. 
Cathedral City High School in the Palm. 
Springs Unified School District. By the end of the pilot, SCE plans to install approximately 250 chargers at more than 30 other school sites.
In Santa Monica, California, SCE Charge Ready Transport helped the municipal bus line increase the number of zero-emission, plug-in electric buses in its fleet of 195 from one to 19 in 2021.

Transportation Electrification. 
SCE leads the largest utility transportation electrification initiatives and programs in the U.S. In 2021, Edison International and SCE earned the Edison Award, the electric power industry’s most prestigious honor, for our efforts to advance transportation electrification. Presented by the Edison Electric Institute, the award recognizes distinguished leadership, innovation and contribution to the advancement of the electric industry for the benefit of all.
Edison Energy1 has begun supporting clients’ transportation electrification strategies and planning to help companies transform their corporate fleet operations and infrastructure in favor of EVs — advising on early-stage considerations, such as EV options and fleet charging; business case development, including recommendations for timing and sequencing of fleet conversion; and design and construction, including construction and charger installation and building and facilities integration.
Light-Duty Vehicles. 
In 2021, SCE launched the second phase of Charge Ready Light Duty, allowing businesses, local governments and other organizations to sign up to participate in the program. Through this program, SCE installs and maintains the supporting EV charging infrastructure while site hosts, who are nonresidential SCE customers, typically own, operate and maintain qualified charging stations. The $436 million program. 
Promoting Big Rig Electrification Among Customers. 
In 2021, SCE’s Charge Ready Transport Program began helping two transportation and logistics companies — NFI Industries Inc. and Schneider National, Inc. — introduce 50 batteryelectric trucks each into their Los Angelesarea operations as part of the Joint Electric Truck Scaling Initiative, which is being led by the South Coast Air Quality Management District, CARB and the CEC.
Through the initiative, NFI and Schneider will begin using 100 battery-electric trucks for regional hauls and for drayage, or the transportation of goods from ports to nearby warehouses. This is the largest initiative of its kind in North America to date.
SCE customers NFI Industries Inc. and Schneider National, Inc. introduced 50 battery-electric trucks like these to their Los Angeles operations.
will add more than 30,000 charge ports in SCE's service area over the next several years and continue the success of the pilot program and its extension that preceded this effort.
As of the end of 2021, approximately 2,800 light-duty charge ports had been installed at approximately 150 sites through SCE’s Charge Ready Light Duty program.
Medium- and Heavy-Duty Vehicles. 
SCE continued to install EV-charging infrastructure for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles through our $356 million Charge Ready Transport program, launched in 2019. In 2021, SCE completed construction at 21 additional sites, up from six in 2020, which will support 235 new medium- and heavy-duty EVs. In 2021, Santa Monica, California’s municipal bus line — dubbed the “Big Blue Bus” — increased the number of zero-emission, plug-in electric buses in its fleet of 195 from one to 19. In addition to installing the on-site charging infrastructure, SCE reconfigured the circuit and extended the power line that serves the bus yard.
Overall, the Charge Ready Transport investment will include up to 870 SCE customer sites supporting nearly 8,500 medium- and heavyduty vehicles by 2027.
SCE’s Transportation Fleet Electrification. 
Consistent with our clean energy and electrification strategy, SCE is electrifying its fleet of approximately 4,900 on-road vehicles. We are planning, optimizing and building the 1 Edison Energy is not the same company as Southern California Edison, the utility, and Edison Energy is not regulated by the California Public Utilities Commission.

STRATEGIC FOCUS AREAS (CONTINUED) —— required charging infrastructure to satisfy near-term internal vehicle demand and for long-term planning to meet our 2025 and 2030 commitments. There is extensive coordination among teams to determine vehicle needs and construct the necessary chargers at priority locations across our service territory. SCE continues to partner directly with manufacturers to promote innovation and quickly bring to market vehicles we can procure. We advise on product development and serve on several manufacturer advisory boards to help find solutions for utility vehicle needs.
Building Electrification. 
Building electrification represents a vital opportunity to reduce GHG emissions and is the area of California’s economy where the least progress has been made. Approximately. 
Supporting the World’s First All-Electric Mega Terminal. 
In 2021, the Port of Long Beach completed a 10-year project to develop the world’s first all-electric, zero-emission mega terminal. Combining two aging terminals, the redeveloped terminal has more than double the capacity while generating half the emissions of the ones it replaced and 90% fewer emissions than its competitors. SCE was a driving force behind the terminal, undertaking a four-year effort to install the needed electrical infrastructure that now serves as the terminal’s backbone.
SCE undertook a four-year effort to install the needed electrical infrastructure that now serves as the backbone of the fully electrified, emission-free Long Beach Container Terminal.
one-third of building space and water heating will need to be electric by 2030 and almost threequarters by 2045.
SCE has proposed to invest $677 million to install roughly 250,000 electric heat pumps and provide 65,000 households with electrical service panel and circuit upgrades across our service area. If approved by the CPUC, our plan would accelerate the widespread replacement of major fossil fuel heating appliances in homes and other buildings. The actions proposed will ultimately benefit all SCE customers through reduced GHG emissions and improved air quality. Our proposal has a focus on income- qualified customers and ESJ communities (see Environmental & Social Justice Communities).
We also implement our building electrification strategy within the company. SCE has a robust building electrification portfolio, with more than 99% of our buildings by count, and 79% of our total building square footage, using electricity as the primary fuel source. For nearterm construction projects, we replace gas equipment with electric solutions based upon the project scope or the equipment’s end-ofuseful life. Additionally, we are exploring how to replace all other gas equipment to achieve a 100% electric building portfolio.

HVACRedu.net to sponsor on-demand classes for beginner through advanced technicians located in our service area.
Grid Modernization. 
SCE is building the grid of the future to deliver 100% carbon-free power in terms of retail sales to customers by 2045. In doing so, we aim to integrate distributed energy resources and other new technologies and services, while safely delivering reliable, affordable and resilient energy.
SCE’s systematic approach to Reimagining the Grid starts with understanding the availability and composition of renewable and carbon-free resources to supply power, as well as future customer needs and the potential impacts of climate change on the system. In particular, SCE is shifting grid planning capabilities from a systemwide-only focus to one that also meets multiple objectives based on specific and localized needs.
Digitization is at the forefront of grid technology. SCE is investing in the next generation of grid management, communication systems and automation that enhance the grid flexibility needed to support higher amounts of electrification and distributed energy resources, while improving reliability. We are increasing our use of drones to gather images 1 Edison Energy is not the same company as Southern California Edison, the utility, and Edison Energy is not regulated by the California Public Utilities Commission.
in the field, as well as artificial intelligence and machine learning, to drive automation and data integration. In 2021, 75% of aerial inspections in SCE’s HFRAs were conducted by drones. As SCE and other electric utilities introduce digital tools, the grid faces increasing risks from malicious actors searching for pathways to attack via these new technologies. SCE studies new and existing infrastructure to identify where defenses can be strengthened as the threat landscape evolves.
Customer Solutions. 
Edison International is committed to providing superior service and a high-quality experience to SCE and Edison Energy1 customers.
Clean Energy at SCE. 
To meet evolving customer needs and improve the customer experience, SCE develops new customer programs to promote clean energy and energy efficiency for all customer classes, with a particular focus on equity and program participation in ESJ communities.
In 2021, SCE launched the second year of the Clean Energy Optimization Pilot, the first comprehensive pay-for-performance GHG emissions pilot in California. Under the $20 million pilot, SCE provides university campuses incentives to reduce GHG emissions. In the first year, five of the seven campuses participating in the pilot reduced emissions by more than 56,000 metric tons, receiving a combined total of more than $4.5 million in incentives.

OUR COMMITMENT TO A DIVERSE, EQUITABLE & INCLUSIVE ENVIRONMENT ——
Diversity is only effective if it is coupled with inclusion, and while we’ve made strides, we recognize we have more to do to create an even more equitable and inclusive workplace. We take a data-driven approach to DEI, centered on transparency around metrics related to representation, pay equity and feelings of inclusion across our company. Using insights derived from metrics we track as well as observations gleaned through candid, facilitated conversations with employees, we continue to hone our approach to creating a psychologically safe work environment where all our team members can thrive.
1 Edison Energy is not the same company as Southern California Edison, the utility, and Edison Energy is not regulated by the California Public Utilities Commission.
Integrating DEI Across Edison International. 
At Edison International, DEI is everyone’s job. It comes to life at Edison International, SCE and Edison Energy1 through teamwork across all levels. For example: • Each SCE operating unit (OU) has a culture team comprised of employees dedicated to advancing DEI, our company values, safety and wellness within their organizations and across the company • Edison Energy's DEI Task Force is divided into subgroups with team leads, executive sponsors and dedicated contributors to handle DEI communications, employee engagement, education and initiatives. 
We undertake a variety of initiatives to promote a culture of honest feedback and open dialogue. Insights and employee sentiment data gained from these initiatives shape our DEI programs and priorities. Among many benefits, this helps us build cohesive teams, effectively and quickly address team members’ concerns and better retain our talent.
In 2021, we instituted Inclusion and Cultural Literacy Conversations, voluntary facilitated conversations that build upon Inclusion and. 
Cultural Literacy Training. The goal of these conversations is to provide a safe space for team members to discuss concepts such as diversity, unconscious bias, microaggressions and microaffirmations.
DEI Commitments. 
Our efforts to advance DEI throughout Edison International and the communities we serve are guided by 10 commitments, which we established in 2020. In 2021, we implemented each of the 10 commitments, most of which initially focused on our Black colleagues and community. Many of the commitments will be expanded in 2022 and beyond to our broader employee population, to further our efforts to embrace all forms of diversity, including age, disability, race, ethnicity, gender, LGBTQ+, religion, veteran status and diversity of thought, and to support all our team members, partners and communities.
For more information on our DEI goals and commitments, see Edison International's 2021 Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Report. Members of the 2021 cohort of the Edison Lineworker Scholarship Program. Edison International has committed to funding a $250,000 annual scholarship program for four years to expand diversity in the lineworker pipeline.
We’re a team that celebrates our differences and is proud to serve one of the most diverse regions in the country. We believe it’s critical to have a workforce that represents the customers and communities we serve, and their broad diversity.

We view DEI as part of a broader, companywide cultural effort. In 2019, SCE created the Culture Congress, a crossdepartmental, cross-functional group of employees who advance key areas of cultural improvement, including DEI.
SCE's Culture Congress oversees each OU’s Culture Team, which develops and leads initiatives around DEI, values and psychological safety, specifically: • Building an inclusive work environment • Advancing talent development and a leadership pipeline • Increasing diverse workforce representation. 
In 2021, SCE's Culture Congress focused largely on creating a set of comprehensive best practices for all employees to create greater inclusivity in leadership, meetings and everyday behavior, whether in a hybrid, remote or on-site working mode. They also laid the foundation for an Employee Recognition Campaign launching in 2022, to bring appreciation and recognition into greater focus in company culture. See Building a Culture of Inclusion: Additional Details for more information.
BUILDING A CULTURE OF INCLUSION ——
Creating Connections Through Business Resource Groups (BRGs) and Employee Resource Groups (ERGs)
As the cornerstone of a diverse and inclusive culture, BRGs play a critical role. At SCE, 12 BRGs represent employees across a range of cultures, racial and ethnic groups, sexual orientations and abilities and cover topics including safety and environmental stewardship. These employee-led, executivesponsored groups amplify the voices of employees, foster connectivity and collaboration across all levels, and provide opportunities for skill building, mentoring and community involvement. In 2021, the BRGs took advantage of the virtual work environment to engage even more team members and expand their reach. Likewise, Edison Energy1 created three ERGs in 2021. See Workforce Attraction, Development & Engagement: Additional Details for more information.

Standing in Solidarity and Resilience with the AAPI Community. 
Each year, SCE hosts an Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) Heritage Month celebration. Our 2021 event took on heightened significance, given the increase in hate crimes and abuse suffered by the AAPI community. The event featured Rob Bonta, California’s first Filipino American Attorney General, who thanked those who stood up in solidarity with the AAPI community.
Edison International’s AAPI BRG, ASCEND, partnered with local nonprofit, Asian Youth Center (AYC), to build a library of career introduction videos for AYC’s students and to help build visibility for the AAPI community in critical professions and in society.
In 2021, Edison International provided more than $100,000 to nonprofit organizations with a focus on anti-Asian racism and discrimination.
Edison International supports calls to crack down on hate crimes and abuse suffered by the AAPI community.
We want all team members to be energized at work through feelings of physical and psychological safety and empowerment. We have made progress in increasing diverse representation, and today we’re adding to that foundation with a focus on building a more inclusive and equitable culture for all.

DEI PERFORMANCE ——
Board & Leadership Diversity. 
Edison International's Board of Directors is diverse. Currently, eight of Edison International’s 11 Board members are diverse in terms of gender, race, ethnicity and/or LGBTQ+ identification, and we achieved gender parity among our independent directors in 2022. We are among the few companies that report LGBTQ+ representation at the board level.
Among our executives, 38% are female, and 36% are racially or ethnically diverse. Our broader leader base is 27% female and 51% racially or ethnically diverse. Since 2017, we have increased the representation of women in our executive leadership by 10 percentage points and are well on our way to achieving our goal of gender parity by 2030. We are working to increase the racial and ethnic diversity of our leaders, and last year we met that goal through a year-over-year increase of 1.8%. For more details, see Diversity, Equity & Inclusion and Sustainability Goals.
Edison International’s Board of Directors oversees initiatives to expand diversity throughout our organization. Prior to the release of our annual DEI report, the Board provides guidance to management and subsequently reviews actions taken, feedback received and progress on the company’s initiatives to enhance transparency and accountability.

Our Diverse Workforce. 
One way we measure the effectiveness of our efforts is by regularly tracking employee demographic data, as well as new hires and turnover rates, by age, race, ethnicity and gender. Additionally, employees are periodically invited to participate in a voluntary Self-ID survey through which they can self-identify as belonging to other demographic groups including gender beyond the binary choice of female/male, sexual orientation, veteran and disability status.
DEI PERFORMANCE (CONTINUED) ——
Edison International has nearly 71% workforce diversity (gender, racial and/ or ethnic). Overall, we see positive trends in racially and ethnically diverse representation at all levels, with representation generally meeting or exceeding labor market availability, i.e., exceeding the diversity of the pool of available talent from which we recruit. We have seen an increase in workforce diversity for the past four years.
We recognize that meeting or exceeding labor market availability does not mean our work is done. Our DEI commitments and philanthropic priorities include increasing underrepresented talent in the labor pool.
In 2021, Edison International scored 100 on Human Rights Campaign’s Corporate Equality Index for the 14th consecutive year.
Pay Equity. 
We believe all team members should be paid equitably regardless of gender, race or ethnicity. In 2016, we signed the Obama Administration’s White House Equal Pay Pledge to underscore our commitment to helping reduce the national pay gap. In 2021, we signed #EqualPayCA, an initiative led by the First Partner’s Office and the California Commission on the Status of Women and Girls. We recognize our role in ensuring pay equity, and we are committed to doing our part to level the playing field. Our 2021 1 “Other” includes American Indian or Alaskan Native, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and Two or More Races.

SCALING OUR EFFORTS ——
Supplier Diversity. 
Diverse businesses drive economic growth, resiliency and stability in communities. In turn, partnerships with diverse businesses provide us with a competitive and sustainable supply base. SCE has a longstanding commitment to increase partnerships with diverse suppliers through supplier inclusion, development and outreach.
SCE’s goal in 2021 was to achieve 38% of total annual procurement spend with diverse suppliers and met that goal, spending $2.44 billion (38%) of the $6.4 billion in total annual procurement spend with diverse suppliers. SCE’s total spend with diverse suppliers was more than $2 billion for the third consecutive year, increasing by $36 million (2%) compared to 2020.
We work with diverse suppliers that support our strategic objectives, primarily the safe delivery of reliable, affordable and clean energy, including wildfire mitigation efforts.
To further expand our diverse supplier base, in 2021 we commissioned a marketplace study to assess the availability of diverse businesses in procurement categories where we have needs. We are using the findings to inform access and spend targets, with an emphasis on Black-owned businesses.
More details, including additional data, about SCE’s supplier diversity program are available in our Supplier Diversity Annual Report.
Community Investment. 
With over 135 years of history, Edison International knows that communities aren’t external to our business—they’re integral to it.
Our broad community investments focus on environment, education, public safety and emergency preparedness, and civic engagement. Within these four pillars, we target projects and organizations that help meet our DEI commitments, as well as our goal, developed in partnership with The Greenlining Institute, to commit at least 80% of our philanthropic giving to underserved communities.
In 2021, more than 80% of Edison International's $20 million in annual philanthropic funding went to organizations and initiatives focused. 
Learn more about how we support our communities, including our approach to community investments.
on diverse and underserved communities. As part of this investment, we have committed $1 million in shareholder funding until 2025 to support organizations that address racial and social justice.
In 2021, Edison International gave $3.5 million to support science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) scholarships specifically targeted to underrepresented college students. This included providing 30 high school seniors each with a $40,000 scholarship to support college study in a STEM subject through the Edison Scholars program.
The 2021 cohort of Edison Scholars received $40,000 each to support their college study in a STEM program.
Achieving Edison International’s DEI vision requires collaboration with a range of partners, including suppliers, who underpin the success of our business, and community organizations that operate on the front lines of societal change.

Public Safety. 
SCE’s approach to public safety begins with more than $5 billion annual planned investment in a safe and reliable grid. Riskbased decision-making helps prioritize upgrades, schedule maintenance and adapt the grid to the effects of climate change, including wildfires. Through SCE’s Reliability Operations Center (Reliability: Additional Details), SCE leverages advanced analytics, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, to alert field crews of potential downed wires and to shut off power at the site, substantially reducing the public safety risk. The company also prepares actively for emergency situations. SCE’s “All-Hazards” response plan establishes the framework for response to emergencies such as earthquakes, cyberattacks, severe weather patterns and pandemics.
Through several public safety outreach programs, SCE shares practical information on actions to take and avoid when encountering electrical safety hazards. We educate the public through a range of platforms and translate the materials into Spanish, Chinese, Korean and Vietnamese to reach our diverse customers. We monitor this outreach yearround through the Customer Attitude Tracking Survey, conducted by a third party. Safety message awareness among SCE customers has risen steadily in the past decade, from 34% to 52% in 2021. See Public Safety: Additional Details for more information.
SAFETY —— Safety is Edison International's top value. We are committed to keeping members of the public and our employees and contractors safe from harm.
Edison International and SCE have an annual goal of no serious injuries to the public due to system failures. In 2021, we achieved this goal.
Employee & Contractor Safety. 
SCE uses a risk-based framework to evaluate and improve the company's safety programs and the cultural efforts that enhance them. In addition to safety culture and job-specific safety training programs, employees are given tools, work practices and motivation. 
See more details about SCE's approach to public safety.
to help them identify and mitigate risks. For example, by using artificial intelligence and predictive modeling, SCE now has the ability to identify the daily average risk at 35 facilities and can break down the risk into the top five contributing components. Crews working at these sites are provided this information with ample time to communicate about and mitigate the risk prior to executing work.
SCE’s employee safety program is generally based upon the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and American Society of Safety Professionals (ASSP) Z102019 standard, one of the most recognized voluntary standards globally and the first. 
SCE Managing Director for Business Resiliency Donald Daigler works with team members in SCE's Emergency Operations Center, which acts as the company's hub for all emergency responses yearround. We have added approximately 6,000 square feet to the center in the past year, doubling its size.

U.S. consensus standard on occupational health and safety management systems. ANSI standards have a long history of adoption in the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations directly relevant to SCE’s core business (e.g., head protection, high visibility apparel, personal fall protection). The ANSI Z10 standard was revised in 2019 to interpret and align the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 45001 standard to a U.S. context. SCE is also a member of the National Safety Council and was proud to receive recognition in early 2021 for our predictive digital platform using artificial intelligence and machine learning to increase worker safety.

Safety Performance. 
In 2021, Edison International had zero employee fatalities for the fifth straight year. Our serious injury and fatality (SIF) rate for employees decreased by 50% compared to 2020 and 37% compared to the previous three-year average. Greater emphasis on SIF risks and prevention contributed to improved performance in 2021 and marks a shift from the performance decline we experienced in 2020.
Edison International’s days away, restricted or transferred (DART) rate increased by 16% in 2021 compared to 2020 and 3% compared to the previous three-year average. Injuries resulting in DART categories were similar among office workers compared to 2020 due to high levels of teleworking since 2020. Injuries 2019 2020 2021 PEER BENCHMARK.

Sprain and strain injuries continued to make up a large proportion of DART injuries. These DART rates reflect a return to average rates following the lower rates experienced during the pandemic. SCE has expanded its plan to target injuries among field employees that result in the most DART categories by engaging local leaders to create actions based on safety data. SCE created local plans in field locations within SCE’s distribution function, and the early adopters are seeing signs of improvement. SCE shares best practices from locations with strong safety performance to help improve other locations.
SCE was deeply saddened that a contractor worker incurred fatal injuries in 2021 as a result of a vehicle-related incident. We take this fatality very seriously. To eliminate SIF and reduce overall injuries among our contractor workers, SCE led additional training to help contractors identify causes of injuries and to improve the safety culture among their leaders. Additionally, we increased learning opportunities for contractors and raised awareness of existing programs. SCE also enhanced contractor safety communications, which helped inform SCE’s own safety action plans.

In 2021, SCE’s performance fell slightly compared to 2020 across all three of its reliability metrics, due to mitigation measures taken to further enhance circuit protection and operations to minimize the probability of ignition during high risk fire weather. We understand that outages are frustrating and inconvenient for our customers. As SCE continues to advance its grid hardening efforts, we anticipate that these operating constraints will be relieved. We expect the long-term benefits of our Reliability Roadmap, which improved SCE’s System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI) performance by 28% in the first year alone (in 2018), will persist.
RELIABILITY —— Similar to the past two years, SCE’s reliability performance has been negatively impacted by our wildfire mitigation efforts, which require a high number of planned outages to harden our infrastructure.
In 2021, SCE also navigated economywide supply chain challenges for both materials and services to ensure reliable service for our customers. As a result of actions being taken in response to the pandemic, SCE's supply chain has faced constraints, and SCE anticipates additional challenges in 2022.

In 2021, SCE continued to maintain the lowest system average rate among California’s large investor-owned utilities, and our rates have grown less than the Los Angeles-area inflation rate over the last 20 years. More broadly, SCE’s work to modernize our grid and expand access to electric technologies is expected to reduce our customers’ overall energy bills, including natural gas and gasoline expenses, by one-third by 2045 for the average household.
In 2021, SCE continued to focus on providing bill relief and other forms of assistance to customers financially affected by COVID-19, including temporarily suspending service disconnections and verification of California Alternate Rates for Energy (CARE) and Family Electric Rate Assistance (FERA) eligibility requirements. SCE distributed bill relief to customers under the California Arrearage Payment Program and advocated strongly for state support for those who could not pay their bills.
In 2021, the California Public Utilities Commission approved an 8.9% rate increase for SCE customers, or about $12.41 per month for a typical residential customer. The bulk of the approved increase will go toward the foundational work that SCE has always performed to maintain and prudently improve. 
AFFORDABILITY —— SCE is committed to making the clean energy transition affordable for our customers, especially those who are economically vulnerable. To achieve our ambitious long-term goals, we are committed to operational excellence. For more than a decade, we have proactively pursued cost-reduction efforts to manage affordability for our customers and absorb rising costs associated with the grid upgrades needed to protect against the threats of extreme weather and strengthen reliability.
the grid and support functions necessary to provide service to our customers. The increase is lower for customers enrolled in bill assistance programs. SCE actively communicates to customers about rate increases and ways they can enroll in programs or change usage to reduce bills.
In addition to electric bills, many of our customers also pay for natural gas and gasoline, both of which contribute to total energy bills. Our Pathway 2045 analysis shows that our customers will pay less over the long-term as they switch to electric vehicles and home appliances. While electric bills may increase due to higher electricity use, Pathway 2045 shows increases would be lower than forecasted savings from switching away from natural gas-powered appliances and gasolinepowered vehicles. As a decoupled utility, SCE does not profit from the sale of each kilowatthour and is incentivized to help customers achieve efficiency in their energy use.
See Affordability: Additional Details for more details on income-qualified customer programs.
Operational Excellence. 
Customer affordability has long been a priority for SCE, and we continue searching for opportunities to enhance safety, quality and affordability. In 2021, SCE advanced its operations by adding innovative systems and digital tools resulting in higher-quality data, improved performance of contractors and greater ability to gather and act on customer feedback. Building on our long history of cost management, we also launched an employee-led continuous improvement program, Operational Excellence Catalyst, to unleash ideas on how we can work better and eliminate waste by reducing frustrations and solving challenges.

ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP —— Edison International is committed to preserving and protecting the environment and implementing sustainable business practices for the benefit of the employees, customers and communities we serve. SCE’s environmental stewardship is grounded in a foundation of strong environmental compliance. We strive to go beyond compliance where feasible through conservation, preservation and mitigation programmatic work, as well as through voluntary disclosures and internal goal setting.
In 2021, SCE began an initiative to strengthen our alignment with the ISO 14001 Environmental Management System (EMS) Standard. SCE assigned a dedicated team and separate governance structure to oversee the effort.
The intent of the initiative, which is ongoing, is to: • Enhance our environmental management to further support sustainable business practices and corporate strategic objectives as an industry leader in enabling a clean energy future • Build, implement and sustain an ISO 14001-aligned EMS1 that further drives effective risk and opportunity management for continuous improvement in the changing context of our operations • Integrate digital solutions to implement the EMS with process enablement, risk monitoring and data analytics to achieve operational efficiencies • Evolve the SCE culture to enhance environmental stewardship through continued leadership commitment, communication and stakeholder engagement.

Material Environmental, Social & Governance (ESG) Topics. 
Edison International’s updated 2021 ESG materiality assessment continues to guide our ESG approach, strategy and reporting.
The assessment identified 26 material ESG topics that reflect our significant economic, environmental and/or social impacts, or that substantively influence the assessment and decisions of our stakeholders.1. 
The resulting matrix comparing internal and external stakeholder prioritization of the material ESG topics shows topics clustering in two groups. Priority topics, in the upper right-hand section of the matrix, are consistent with our strategic priorities and the topics necessitating greater focus in terms of reporting, as well as the potential for further strategic analysis. Foundational topics, in the lower left-hand section, are also important to the company and external stakeholders and will continue to be a focus for monitoring and reporting.

Shareholder Engagement. 
Edison International engages with our major institutional shareholders on strategy and financial and operational performance throughout the year. We also engage with these shareholders at least annually on corporate governance, executive compensation and ESG issues.
During the past year, we contacted the investor stewardship teams of our top 25 shareholders, representing approximately 68% of our shares, and met virtually or by telephone with holders of approximately 50% of our shares. Topics discussed during these engagements included:
Board composition, skills and leadership. 
Executive compensation goals, incentives and metrics. 
Progress on our clean energy strategy and wildfire risk mitigation. 
Sustainability goals, reporting and disclosure. 
DEI commitments and reporting. 
Political activity policies, reporting and oversight. 
The shareholders offered constructive feedback on our governance, executive compensation and sustainability initiatives, which was subsequently shared with the Board and its Compensation and Executive Personnel and Nominating and Governance Committees.
Employee Engagement. 
We encourage employees to participate in the company's sustainability efforts. Engagement occurs in a number of ways, including through business resource groups (BRGs) such as EcoIQ, the company's BRG focused on environmental stewardship, and regular, cross-organizational sustainabilityfocused meetings for employees working on sustainability priorities as part of their day-today role and/or interested in deepening their involvement in the effort.
Sustainable Financing Framework. 
In June 2021, Edison International published a Sustainable Financing Framework aligned with the four core components of the International Capital Market Association Green Bond Principles and Social Bond Principles.
The framework enables us to align capitalraising activities with sustainability principles. The eligible projects identified in the framework cover a substantial portion of our capital plan, including transmission and distribution infrastructure for the interconnection and delivery of renewable generation using our grid, our electric vehicle charging infrastructure programs and grid modernization and resiliency investments. Vigeo Eiris, now Moody’s ESG Solutions, provided the second-party opinion and found that the framework’s contribution to sustainability and expected impacts are both advanced, the highest rating.

Climate Change Mitigation: Additional Details. 
California State Goals. 
California’s economywide goals include a 40% reduction in absolute greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from 1990 levels by 2030, and 80% by 20501, as well as to achieve carbon neutrality no later than 2045.2 Taken together, these goals are broadly considered to be consistent with keeping global temperature increases below 1.5°C, as set out in the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C. The California Air Resources Board (CARB) updates its climate change scoping plan at regular intervals to outline the state’s strategy for meeting economywide climate goals. The 2017 Scoping Plan, which is the most recent, detailed California’s plan to meet its 2030 GHG emissions reduction target. The 2022 Scoping Plan, expected out by November, will outline pathways to achieving carbon neutrality by 2045 while also assessing the progress California is making toward reducing its GHG emissions by at least 40% below 1990 levels by 2030.3 CARB also maintains the state’s GHG emissions inventory, covering seven of the nine Kyoto Protocol GHGs4 and all anthropogenic emissions in California, plus imported electricity.5 All of Edison International’s California-based emissions plus electricity that SCE imports are included within. 
SCE’s analysis indicates that California needs to achieve 80% carbon-free electricity by 2030, along with emissions reductions in other sectors through electrification (e.g., transportation and buildings), to affordably meet the state’s GHG emissions-reduction targets. SCE is advocating, as part of an economywide approach, for California to go beyond the current 2030 goal of 60% RPS-eligible power delivered to customers and to enact complementary policies that reduce emissions from transportation and buildings through electrification. In 2022, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) adopted a decision based on an integrated resource planning process (IRP) created by 1 The California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2016 (SB 32, Pavley), September 8, 2016 (https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160SB32).
2 Executive Order B-55-18 to Achieve Carbon Neutrality, September 9, 2018 (https://www.ca.gov/archive/gov39/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/9.10.18-Executive-Order.pdf).
An independently prepared report for CARB in October 2020 defined carbon neutrality as “…all greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions emitted into the atmosphere are balanced in equal measure by GHGs that are removed from the atmosphere, either through carbon sinks or carbon capture and storage.” The terms “carbon neutrality” and “net-zero GHG emissions” are used interchangeably in this report.

6 The definition for the metric has been updated to clarify that it relates to the California Energy Commission’s (CEC) RPS compliance program, as opposed to the CEC’s Power Source Disclosure Program (PSDP). SCE retires renewable energy credits on an annual basis to meet its 2030 and 2045 RPS and carbon-free power goals and interim targets. See Carbon Footprint for more details.

Senate Bill 350 (De Leon 2015) to ensure that our electric sector meets California’s GHG emissions reduction goals. The approved IRP decision adopts electric sector planning targets of 38 million metric tons (MMT) GHG emissions by 2030 and 35 MMT by 2032, which equates to 73% RPS resources and 86% GHG-free resources by 2032.

Delivered Power Mix & GHG Emissions: Additional Information. 
SCE is a major player within California’s competitive energy landscape, which includes the state’s three major investor-owned electric utilities, dozens of other load-serving entities (LSEs), such as public utilities and community choice aggregators, and hundreds of independent power producers, such as natural gas operators and solar plants.
In addition to these players, the California Independent System Operator (CAISO), CPUC and CEC play a role in keeping the lights on statewide and ensuring the state meets its clean energy and climate goals: • The CAISO, which controls the grid that covers most of California, is responsible for balancing the grid (i.e., matching available power supply with customer demand in real-time and ensuring power is flowing on a daily basis) • The CPUC is responsible for medium- and long-term planning, putting policies and requirements in place to ensure LSEs, including SCE, bring enough resources, such as wind and solar energy, to the market to meet customer demand • The CEC oversees proposed energy infrastructure and the state’s RPS and energy efficiency programs, among other things. 
These entities have different responsibilities, and we all work closely to meet our collective goal to provide reliable, affordable and clean power to customers in a safe manner.
SCE’s power mix includes both specified and unspecified energy resources. Specified energy resources can be traced back to the generation source from an accounting perspective and consist predominantly of energy stemming from contracts SCE enters into with third-party generators, such as solar or wind facilities to meet clean energy requirements, or natural gas generators to meet reliability requirements. Generation from SCE’s own plants is also considered specified energy. SCE makes its plants available to the CAISO on an economic dispatch basis, which means the CAISO will call on them to run when it is cost-effective to do so.
Unspecified energy resources are those that are purchased through open-market transactions and cannot be tied to a generation facility. Over the past decade, SCE divested entirely from coal generation and also shut down our nuclear plant, the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station (SONGS) (see SONGS Decommissioning). These actions have required new resources to fill approximately one-third of our power mix. SCE replaced a portion of this gap with renewable contracts to support meeting our long-term renewable energy and carbon-free power goals. However, in lieu of building or procuring new generation facilities or entering into medium- or long-term contracts to fill the remainder of the gap, we instead rely on open market transactions through the CAISO. This approach reduces the cost and administrative burden associated with plant ownership and contracting, while still enabling us to meet our climate goals. Unspecified energy resources in our power mix stemming from these open market transactions have increased from 15% to 32% since 2011.
Unspecified energy resources that service SCE's load are predominantly generated in California and consist of natural gas and renewable resources, like wind and solar, with. 
CLIMATE CHANGE (CONTINUED) —— more renewables added to the grid each year. This may include imported electricity from the broader Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) region, which includes generation resources from 14 western states, as well as the Canadian provinces of Alberta and British Columbia and the northern portion of Baja, Mexico. While it is not possible to know exactly what percentage of the power is generated within California, it is likely that the majority of the power is from in-state sources. Electrons are “lost” when they travel over long distances. A plant producing power in Montana, for example, will not be able to deliver as much of its output to SCE’s service area as a plant in California, due to transmission losses.
As a conservative approach, given WECC-wide power is not as clean as the CAISO market on average, SCE uses a WECC-wide average emissions intensity factor to account for the emissions of unspecified energy resources in its portfolio. This emissions intensity factor is within the range of, though slightly lower than, the average emissions intensity factor of a natural gas plant. For more information about our GHG emission inventory see Carbon Footprint.
SCE’s long-term resource planning, including the need for new energy procurements, is approved via proceedings at the CPUC, and when procurement happens it is then recovered as a passthrough rate. SCE does not profit from the sale of electricity (i.e., customers pay the direct energy cost). The IRP proceeding is the central regulatory forum to ensure SCE’s long-term resource plans meet reliability needs, state-designated GHG emissions-reduction requirements and other factors for SCE’s projected load in the most affordable way.

SCE files an IRP every two to three years. Our most recent filing in September 2020 aligned with our goal to achieve 80% carbon-free power by 2030, above the state’s current clean energy mandates.
Owned Generation and Storage Assets. 
SCE-owned generation assets consist of a portion of the Palo Verde nuclear plant in Arizona, natural gas plants, hydroelectric plants, battery energy storage, solar rooftop installations and a small diesel plant to serve Catalina Island. SCE plans to replace the diesel-generating station with new, cleaner diesel generators that will achieve two-thirds N2O emissions reductions by 2023. SCE also has one of the largest energy-storage portfolios in the nation (see Clean Energy).
Our natural gas assets are all based in Southern California and are SCE-owned and operated. These plants are clean and efficient, in compliance with California regulations.
SCE’s largest plant, Mountainview Generating Station, is a 1,104 MW efficient natural gas combined cycle resource. SCE also operates five natural gas-fired peaker plants — power plants that are turned on only when energy. 
CLIMATE CHANGE (CONTINUED) —— demand is peaking. Two of these peaker plants, in Norwalk and Rancho Cucamonga, use enhanced gas turbines, which operate with a battery hybrid system. The technology can avoid burning fuel while still providing spinning reserves and delivers annual reductions in criteria pollutants and GHG emissions of roughly 60% compared to peakers that do not use the same technologies. In addition, SCE is upgrading the plants to automatic control systems to improve their efficiency and environmental performance.
SCE’s largest hydroelectric resource is Big Creek, located in the Sierra Nevada mountains. Through water planning and control system improvements, we have enhanced the flexible operation capacity of Big Creek. The improvements enable Big Creek to provide ancillary services that help integrate renewable energy resources into the grid.
Climate Adaptation: Additional Details About SCE's Wildfire Mitigation Plan. 
SCE submits its annual Wildfire Mitigation Plan (WMP) to the Office of Energy Infrastructure Safety. The WMP outlines SCE's mitigation strategies and activities to reduce wildfire risk. SCE met or exceeded nearly all of its mitigation program targets set as part of its three-year 2020–2022 WMP and annual updates.
In 2021, SCE continued to execute on our WMP. Below is a summary of SCE’s 2021 accomplishments: • Hardened Infrastructure: In addition to the approximately 1,500 miles of overhead power lines SCE replaced with covered conductor, we installed or replaced fuses at 350 locations and installed sectionalizing devices at 23 locations. SCE also implemented technologies to detect equipment issues early in order to make repairs before the equipment fails.
• Vegetation Management: SCE maintained power line-tree clearance; assessed more than 131,000 trees and trimmed nearly 3,400 of them to mitigate any impact on power lines and fire ignition risks; and cleared brush at the base of more than 163,000 poles. SCE inspects 1.5 million trees across its service area annually and typically trims 900,000 of those trees. More than half are located in high fire risk areas (HFRA).
SCE’s Estimated Owned Generation Mix as a Percent of Delivered Power in 20211. 
In 2021, approximately 16% of power delivered to SCE’s customers is estimated to have come from SCE's utility-owned generation.
9% 4% 3% 1% <0.5% <0.5% 1 This is an estimate of SCE’s owned generation mix as a proportion of delivered power in 2021. The estimate is based on the methodology prescribed by the CEC’s PSDP as of April 2, 2022. SCE’s final PSDP report will be filed with the CEC on June 1, 2022, and may include data that differs from the estimate shown here to reflect subsequent changes or clarifications to PSDP’s methodology and reporting template.
See SONGS Decommissioning for information on how we’re partnering to safely dismantle spent nuclear assets.

• High Fire Risk Area Inspections: SCE completed more than 200,000 inspections on distribution and transmission structures in HFRA and performed corresponding repairs and replacements within due dates. We also inspected equipment in areas with emergent fire weather conditions, such as dry fuels. Our inspections provide a 360-degree view of our infrastructure and include ground observations from field personnel as well as an aerial view using drones and helicopters.
• Situational Awareness: SCE installed approximately 400 additional weather stations, bringing the total to approximately 1,460 weather stations. These weather stations provide granular weather data from machine-learning models, which may improve wind forecasts at the weather station point location. This will help to precisely target public safety power shutoffs (PSPS) de-energization events to reduce the number of customers affected. SCE also has 166 high-definition wildfire cameras that provide visibility to about 90% of the HFRA in SCE’s service area. SCE plans to install additional cameras in 2022 and beyond to increase coverage to nearly all HFRA. SCE installed additional high-performance computing clusters and piloted machine learning algorithms at SCE’s weather station locations to improve weather modeling accuracy. SCE plans to deploy machine learning for more weather stations in 2022.
• Risk Modeling: SCE developed an integrated grid-hardening strategy to evaluate the optimal set of mitigations to further reduce wildfire and PSPS risks more effectively throughout SCE’s HFRA. This strategy is built on advancements made in SCE’s risk modeling capabilities and understanding of the effectiveness of mitigation alternatives.
Public Safety Power Shutoffs. 
Another major element of SCE’s public safety approach is to mitigate risks that our equipment contributes to sparking or propagating wildfires, which are now more prevalent, due to a number of climate changedriven factors. SCE preemptively de-energizes circuits, or portions of circuits, that are experiencing extreme weather conditions or fire risks through PSPS. These necessary de-energizations are a tool of last resort to mitigate wildfire risk during extreme fire risk conditions. SCE knows PSPS can cause hardship to customers. We are focused on reducing the duration and frequency of de-energization events in a risk-informed manner to provide more customer resiliency, as outlined in our PSPS Action Plan which we submitted to the CPUC in February 2021.
SCE’s primary wildfire mitigation efforts are vital to reducing the impact of PSPS. Among other things, we accelerated grid-hardening efforts focusing on circuits with four or more PSPS de-energization events since 2019. We have also developed and applied new technologies to help determine wildfire threats in our HFRA with accuracy, including where a large fire could potentially start having significant impacts on our customers, communities and infrastructure. With work completed last year, SCE estimates that customers on the most frequently impacted circuits experienced 70% less PSPS outage time based on 2021 weather and fuel conditions (see Climate Adaptation).
When using PSPS, SCE conducts community outreach to help customers and public safety partners prepare. We also maintain an interactive map of PSPS events on our website and enhance our notification systems to alert customers in PSPS regions ahead of potential de-energizations, with the intent to give as much notice as possible when feasible.
By contracting with Community Resource Centers and deploying Community Crew Vehicles to provide information, support and power access, SCE provides relief to customers affected by PSPS. In 2021, we established a PSPS readiness team which includes a Customer Care Team to support customer resiliency during PSPS events. Since 2020, we have provided more than 7,000 free portable backup batteries and solar panels to incomequalified critical care customers who depend on life-support medical equipment and live in an HFRA. We also offered rebates on backupbattery solutions and generators and hotel discounts for customers experiencing an extended outage, including PSPS.
Environmental & Social Justice (ESJ): Additional Details. 
Edison International continues to sponsor the emPOWER program, which is run by Liberty Hill and ValleyCAN, two California-based ESJ community organizations. The program provides funding, training and other tools to community-based organizations for culturally appropriate and in-language.

education about the cost savings available from clean-energy programs. It also helps residents apply for programs and incentives.
The Climate Resilience Leadership Group that SCE launched for the first time in 2021 to inform our Climate Adaptation Vulnerability Assessment consisted of community leaders from 11 organizations. The group helped administer to community and tribal members more than 780 surveys to solicit feedback on how potential climate adaptation mitigations undertaken by SCE might impact disadvantaged vulnerable communities.
In 2021, SCE also continued to collaborate with the Clean Energy Access Working Group (CEAWG) members to review clean energyrelated policies, programs and projects targeting ESJ communities. The CEAWG consists of key community stakeholders interested in advancing clean energy projects in ESJ communities and began with a partnership between SCE and the Greenlining Institute. In the past two years, Edison International allocated more than $400,000 in grants for clean energy projects proposed by CEAWG members.
Strategic Focus Areas: Additional Details.

ESJ Initiatives. 
SCE considers low-income customers and ESJ communities1 when designing programs and incentives to connect customers with clean energy technologies.
$210 million+ in available customer incentives for installation of solar through the Solar on Multifamily Affordable Homes and Disadvantaged Communities Single Family Solar Homes programs.
Install approximately one‑quarter of electric space and water heaters through the HVAC energy efficiency incentive program in DACs (22% in 2021).
Have installed fast-charging stations, which reduce charging times to 30 minutes or less, and electric bus-charging infrastructure in disadvantaged communities (DACs).
Target 50% of investments in the expansion of light-duty EV charging program in DACs and remained on track in 2021 with cumulative 49% of ports and 51% of installment sites located in DACs.
vehicle (EV) rebate2 of up to $750 at the time of purchase or lease. The CCFR is the largest point-of-sale EV incentive program in the country by volume. Through the SCE PreOwned EV Rebate program, we continued to provide a $1,000 rebate to our customers, and now offer $4,000 to qualifying low-income customers, for the purchase of pre-owned EVs. In 2021, through both programs, SCE provided more than $92 million in rebates to its customers toward the purchase or lease of a new or used EV, and SCE expects to provide an additional $1 billion in noncustomerfunded incentives to advance transportation electrification between now and 2030.
We have continued to see growth in EV registrations in SCE's service area, with a 25% increase year-over-year between 2020 and 2021. One in seven EVs sold in the U.S. through 2021 were in SCE's service area.

CLIMATE CHANGE (CONTINUED) —— to the unique requirements of the grid in different regions or contexts. Traditionally, equipment suppliers developed standard solutions to address uniform needs across the grid. Now we need suppliers to develop more modular and customizable solutions that match our heterogenous needs. The grid also needs tools to handle the increasing complexity of future grid operations, such as more distributed energy resources (DERs) interconnected to the system. It will need to be equipped with sensors; high-speed and high-volume communications technologies; edge computing, i.e., a form of computing that operates on real-time data generated by sensors or users; predictive analytics and artificial intelligence.

Grid Modernization. 
To optimize grid planning decisions, SCE is preparing the grid for the different demands presented by different regions. Effective grid planning requires SCE to strengthen its forward-planning capabilities to reduce uncertainty. We are improving our ability to track early indicators of key trends, such as EV sales, resource portfolio mix, climate model changes around temperature and precipitation, resource availability and new grid technologies.
SCE is updating our grid design to reflect heterogeneity of specific and localized needs. We are also evolving our ability to sectionalize, or isolate, certain components of the grid. Expanding grid capabilities requires innovation, including within SCE’s supply chain. SCE is working with our suppliers to develop hardware and software solutions that respond system, enabling DER owners to supply carbon-free energy to the grid. Integrating DERs into the power distribution system benefits not only DER owners, but everyone connected to the grid. Delivering this energy at the right time, and in the right areas, can reduce the need for capital upgrades, thereby lowering infrastructure costs and increasing overall system efficiency.
In 2021, SCE interconnected approximately 72,000 behind-the-meter, solar-only installations, including enhancements of, or expansions to, existing systems. The use of behind-the-meter energy storage paired with solar continued to grow in 2021, increasing more than 60% from approximately 5,000 DERs added in 2020 to approximately 8,000 added in 2021. By year-end 2021, approximately 465,000 SCE customers had connected solar or paired energy storage systems to the grid.

Through SCE’s Self-Generation Incentive Program, we offer customers incentives that reduce the cost of installing new energy storage systems. SCE incentivizes customersited solar through our net energy metering (NEM) rate. NEM customers do not reduce or defer SCE's investments in transmission and distribution.
While NEM incentives have contributed to a 70% drop in the cost of rooftop solar systems, the cost of this generous subsidy is paid for by utility customers who do not have solar panels — typically renters and lowerincome households. SCE, California's other investor-owned utilities and hundreds of community groups belong to the Affordable Clean Energy for All coalition, which supports reforming NEM so it that it is more equitable for all Californians. SCE's advocacy position is focused on addressing the cost shift that disproportionately impacts our most vulnerable customers.
For customers who do not have the option to install solar or energy storage at their properties, SCE offers our Green Rate and Community Renewables programs. Customers who enroll can choose to power their home or business with 50%–100% solar energy through third-party renewable power purchase agreements that SCE procures on the customers’ behalf. At the end of 2021, SCE had about 2,500 customers enrolled in the Green Rate program, across approximately 1,300 residential and 1,200 nonresidential accounts.
Virtual Power Plants (VPPs)
VPPs are a new solution for customers seeking to increase their resiliency to extreme weather and provide clean energy to the grid when it needs it. Up to 1,500 residents who live in SCE's service area can now sign up to receive incentives to send energy from solar panels stored in a home battery back to the grid when the battery storage system receives a signal that electricity is needed.
Incentives for Efficient and Clean Energy Use. 
As intermittent renewable resources like wind and solar are added to the grid, the time and location of customers’ energy use is increasingly important to meeting SCE’s clean energy goals. Time-of-use (TOU) rates aim to lower energy demand during peak hours, which supports GHG emissions reduction by encouraging customers to shift use to times of day when the energy supply is cleaner. We have expanded participation in this rate in recent years. At the end of 2021, approximately 1.4 million residential customers (about 32%) and close to 100% of nonresidential customers took service on TOU rates.
SCE’s energy-efficiency programs incentivize customers to replace old appliances, like heating and air conditioning systems, lighting and industrial process equipment, with energy-efficient models. In 2021, SCE offered more than 110 energy-efficiency programs that saved 1,584 gigawatt hours of energy. This translated to the elimination of approximately 390,000 tons of GHG emissions and saved customers an estimated $761 million on their bills.
SCE also offers demand response (DR) programs that reward participants for making short-term reductions in their energy use based on alerts from SCE or our partner companies, thereby reducing the need for incremental gas-fired generation. SCE offers a variety of DR programs. More than 485,000 residential and commercial accounts were enrolled in DR in 2021, with 744 MW of resources made available for reduction.
Clean Energy Partners. 
There are many stakeholders involved in the planning and procurement of energy to serve customer needs. Local governments may choose to enter their communities into a Community Choice Aggregation program; commercial and industrial customers may enter into long-term contracts with third parties for energy as part of Direct Access; and individual customers may opt to install rooftop solar, connect energy storage and/or otherwise generate their own energy.
SCE is committed to partnering across this stakeholder landscape to provide customers with reliable service and optimal customer experiences. This means offering and supporting customer choices around how their energy is generated, while providing transmission and distribution services to all. SCE also takes seriously its role as a provider of last resort for customers.
SCE also works with other partners, including solar and energy storage contractors, to bring customers the best deals for solar energy installation. We offer an online marketplace where customers can compare solar and energy storage system installers and receive a discount of up to $500 on the systems if they purchase them through the marketplace.

SCE is a long-standing steward of the environment and considers our responsibility to minimize our environmental footprint a foundation of our operations.
SCE promotes the efficient use of natural resources, including energy and water, minimizes emissions and reduces waste to landfills. SCE employees and contractors work to be stewards of the land, promote biodiversity and preserve cultural resources through programs that reduce impacts on wildlife, natural habitats, cultural resources and communities. Additionally, SCE engages tribal communities and consults stakeholders on environmental matters and potential impacts to ensure diversity of perspectives and voices in its environmental processes.
Edison International’s Board of Directors provides oversight of environmental compliance issues, and SCE’s environmental management system (EMS) guides our efforts to protect and restore the environment.
Environmental Management System. 
SCE is undergoing an initiative to strengthen the alignment of our EMS with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14001 EMS Standard (see Environmental Stewardship).1 SCE’s existing EMS continues to guide our approach. SCE documents environmental processes in our Environmental Compliance Program Manual, and we apply these processes across 33 program areas.
ENVIRONMENT ——
We manage environmental program objectives and compliance obligations for our construction and mitigation projects, as well as field maintenance and facility operations. SCE evaluates alignment with industry best practices for the EMS, including their implementation, striving to ensure that each element is effective and to identify opportunities for improvement.
EMS Governance. 
SCE’s EMS outlines roles and responsibilities for environmental stewardship, beginning with the Environmental Services Department Director, who serves as the company’s environmental compliance program leader.
SCE has an Environmental Leadership Council, a cross-functional, executive-level group responsible for evaluating environmental standards and programs and providing guidance to ensure consistent implementation and support throughout our operations. Among other topics, the council evaluates noncompliance incidents and trends, sharing best practices and directing improvement opportunities.
Environmental program managers serve as subject matter experts and are responsible for tracking regulatory changes, developing strategies and processes for achieving compliance and documenting implementation steps in standards, manuals and operational handbooks. Program managers monitor for adherence to compliance requirements and seek opportunities to enhance their program’s performance across company operations.
SCE's EMS Goals. 
SCE works to continuously improve its practices in all the communities where we operate and serve to: • Manage operations to meet or exceed applicable environmental laws and regulations • Implement environmentally sound standards and programs to avoid or reduce our impacts on the environment and our communities • Promote the efficient use of natural resources, including energy and water, minimize emissions, reduce waste to landfill and effectively manage discharges • Protect biodiversity and cultural resources through programs to minimize impacts to wildlife, natural habitats, archeological resources and communities at and around SCE facilities, operations and forestlands • Engage tribal communities in. 
SCE’s service area to ensure their concerns are considered when planning projects • Involve stakeholders on environmental matters and impacts • Deploy the company's strategic focus areas across our facility, fleet and supply chain operations 1 While SCE is working to enhance its alignment with the ISO 14001 standard, SCE does not currently intend to seek formal ISO certification from a third-party certification body.

Environmental operations advisors serve as field resources at operational sites and manage activities within each compliance program at their assigned facilities, performing regular compliance assessments, providing front-line compliance assistance for operations and coordinating on-site regulatory agency inspections.
EMS Monitoring and Measurement. 
As part of our EMS, SCE documents conformance with environmental requirements and environmental inspections. We share information and data, with cross-departmental and executive leadership forums, contractors, and the SCE Environmental Leadership Council. Environmental program managers conduct program evaluations to identify ways to enhance compliance controls and improve compliance performance. SCE maintains environmental performance records per its Record Management Policy, communicates via regulatory filings and compliance reports to the appropriate agency, and shares notices of violations (NOVs) in aggregate through this report (see Sustainability Scorecard).
SCE introduced a contractor environmental metric to improve contractor performance in pursuit of company goals. The metric includes targets and thresholds to monitor contractors’ performance, improve problem solving and increase accountability. Contractors who do not meet performance thresholds must complete and implement corrective action plans and may be subject to removal of work scope or work suspension.
ENVIRONMENT (CONTINUED) ——
SCE’s Environmental Services Department facilitates environmental reviews, permitting and compliance across the company. This includes managing nearly 1,500 environmental permits and submitting more than 1,400 reports to regulatory agencies annually, as well as reviewing the potential impacts of infrastructure construction and maintenance projects. In 2021, SCE conducted environmental reviews of more than 42,000 transmission, distribution and generation infrastructure projects and more than 300,000 vegetation management projects to identify and avoid or minimize impacts to sensitive habitats, archaeological sites and other protected resources.
Regulatory Inspections. 
SCE undergoes regular environmental regulatory inspections. In 2021, we hosted 479 regulatory agency inspections, a 32% increase compared with 2020, due to a return to normal inspection frequency after COVID-19-related delays in 2020. Of these inspections, 97% had zero NOVs, improving from 92% in 2020. SCE uses incidents of noncompliance to evaluate our EMS, conduct cause analyses and identify operational improvements.
EMS Training. 
SCE’s EMS includes a broad compliance-based training and awareness program. There were more than 12,000 employee training course enrollments in 2021 across all environmental compliance training courses. Our training courses consist of computer-based learning modules, as well as instructor-led, and role- or region-specific courses that are developed, deployed, tracked and reported by our learning management system. Training covers environmental operational disciplines such as hazardous material handling awareness and response and waste management, among dozens of other compliance program requirements relevant to environmental compliance and stewardship.
Air Quality & Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Management. 
SCE is a long-standing partner with the state of California, customers and communities to improve air quality. Air pollution is a significant environmental challenge affecting public health across SCE’s communities, particularly disadvantaged communities.
SCE manages six air quality programs covering Title V, Stationary Source, Sulfur Hexafluoride (SF6), Climate Change/Sustainability, Area Source and Mobile Source, to ensure compliance with federal, state and local air pollution rules and regulations, and support voluntary initiatives. These programs exceed mandatory compliance obligations in key areas, including those related to criteria air pollutant quantification and benchmarking, low-carbon fuel standard reporting on SCE's employee electric vehicle (EV) charging program, and reduction of mobile source pollution through electrification of SCE's transportation fleet (see Transportation Electrification).

Sulfur Hexafluoride. 
SF6 is a GHG used in SCE’s distribution and substation gas-insulated equipment. California Air Resources Board regulation requires the gradual phaseout of SF6 due to its high global warming potential.
SCE developed a comprehensive SF6 phaseout roadmap and in 2021 issued a Request for Information to all major industry suppliers seeking alternative options. SCE is working with current suppliers to develop nonSF6 alternatives for existing SF6 gas-filled loadbreak switch and circuit breaker designs and is evaluating available non-SF6 alternatives using the following criteria: operability, longterm dielectric and switching performance, failure modes and end-of-life handling.
To reduce emissions in the interim, SCE implemented a comprehensive leak mitigation plan related to substation construction and maintenance where the majority of SF6 gas is used.
Water Management & Conservation. 
Water scarcity is a concern in California, and climate change exacerbates the stress on water resources in the state. Seventy-five percent of California’s rain and snow falls in watersheds north of Sacramento, yet 80% of the state's water demands and use falls in the southern two-thirds of the state. Water resources are stretched — so much so that in October 2021, a drought emergency was declared across California, and the State Water Resources Control Board issued a Drought Conservation Emergency Regulation in early 2022. Operating in this drought-prone environment makes SCE’s water management practices a top priority.
SCE implements seven programs to protect water quality and conserve water. These programs cover construction projects, facility stormwater, drinking water, industrial wastewater, spill response, well management and wetlands protection. Program managers oversee water quality programs, collaborating with departments to embed water reduction measures and targets into facility operations, construction activities and permits.
SCE promotes sustainable water use in three categories:
Strategically managing water in power generation facilities (waterenergy nexus)
Capturing and reusing stormwater runoff (stormwater harvesting)
Reducing water consumption at SCE offices, facilities and construction projects. 
SCE monitors water consumption of our generation assets. In 2021, our water consumed for generation was 716 million gallons, the majority of which occurred at our Mountainview Generating Station. Nearly all (98.3%) of the water Mountainview consumed was from nonpotable sources, including groundwater withdrawal from the local contaminated aquifer and recycled water from the city. Further, 85% of the water discharged from Mountainview was recovered and reused in the plant. SCE’s peaker plants (see Owned Generation and Storage Assets) represent the remainder of SCE's water consumption from generation facilities. Two of SCE’s five peaker plants operated with a hybrid-battery system, which saves water.
SCE also owns hydroelectric plants, which produce electricity from water stored in reservoirs or from runoff water that is derived from melting snow in the San Gabriel and Sierra mountains. Once the water passes through the hydroelectric plants, where it drives turbine generators, it is returned to lakes, reservoirs or streams to be made available for other purposes.
Beyond our generation assets, SCE seeks to improve on-site water quality and water reuse at our facilities. At several of SCE's facilities, we implement best management practice (BMP) features, such as infiltration basins, pervious pavement and biofiltration swales, which are designed to capture stormwater and minimize potential pollutants from stormwater runoff.

Appendix 57


Through Geographic Information System mapping, we digitally capture the amount of water being infiltrated and recharging our groundwater through implementation of Stormwater BMP. At our substation in Monterey Park, California — Mesa Substation — a newly constructed vegetated biofiltration swale captures stormwater runoff and filters out potential pollutants. At Safari Substation in Irvine, California, approximately 5,000 square feet of pervious asphalt pavement has been installed to allow stormwater to pass through voids in the pavement surface and into the underlying subsurface, allowing for infiltration. Benefits include filtering of potential pollutants out of runoff and infiltration into the groundwater table. Additionally, SCE maintains an internal standard in general accordance with California’s Sustainable Groundwater Management Act, which provides a framework to manage groundwater and drinking water. SCE manages surface water diversions for hydroelectric power separately under the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission structure.
SCE seeks to replace grass with droughttolerant landscaping at our facilities and to improve our irrigation systems to reduce water use. For example, in 2021, SCE began sustainable landscape projects at our South Bay and Whittier Service Centers. The combined sites decreased potable water consumption from approximately 619,000 gallons of water per year to approximately 303,000 gallons of water per year — a 51% reduction in water use for the landscape area. We also installed new or upgraded irrigation controller devices to ensure responsible irrigation at nearly 60 facilities and save potable water.
ENVIRONMENT (CONTINUED) ——
Waste Management & Asset Recovery. 
When materials are at the end of their useful life, SCE follows all federal, state and local laws and regulations to determine how they will be reused, recycled, resold or disposed. We seek opportunities to implement a circular economy by reselling or donating material and assets. Where these options don’t exist, SCE evaluates the material for recycling or disposal.
SCE’s internal standards and manuals outline procedures for identifying, handling, storing and transporting waste produced by SCE work and generated at SCE facilities. SCE manages more than 30 different hazardous and nonhazardous waste streams. Items designated as waste (rather than investment recovery) are evaluated to determine if they are hazardous and sent to disposal facilities authorized to receive and process the waste. A cross-functional committee at SCE reviews and approves all hazardous waste transporters and disposal facilities for use by the company.
In addition, SCE has introduced a Sustainable Construction BMP Manual to reduce SCE’s waste footprint associated with erosion and sediment control products. Renewable and more sustainable BMP products are catalogued in this manual to support the transition of renewable product usage and re-use in replacement of single-use traditional BMPs. These renewable and reusable BMP products were first introduced as a pilot in 2021 at the Lake Success Project. During the life of the pilot, renewable BMPs will solely be utilized and quantified while also collecting generated waste data. SCE will begin to provide this manual to contractors on a broader set of construction projects.
2021 Material Recycling and Reuse by the Numbers 3,800 square yards of used carpet recycled 41.9 million pounds of asset material sold 900,000 gallons of oil recycled 17,000 tons of asphalt recycled. 
More than 239,000 pounds of Smart Meters recycled 2.6 million pounds of material recycled from three substation power transformer dismantlement projects. 
More than 380,000 pounds of batteries recycled 99% of old or damaged workstations reused. 
More than 3,700 yards of facility vegetation recycled 2 tons of paper recycled. 
More than 192,000 pounds of various universal wastes recycled.

SONGS Decommissioning. 
In 2013, after more than 40 years of generating clean electricity, SCE permanently retired the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station (SONGS). To guide our decommissioning efforts, SCE established the principles of safety, stewardship and engagement. With extensive environmental reviews by state agencies complete, SCE is dismantling the site. Work is currently focused on three key workstreams: • Dismantling above-ground structures • Safely storing spent fuel on-site • Advocating for the relocation of SONGS’s spent fuel to a licensed off-site facility. 
By the end of 2021, we dismantled 25 of 62 above-ground structures as part of a process that will continue until approximately 2028. SCE has received a top-performing 0.00 score from the California Department of Toxic Substances Control for zero violations in SONGS’s environmental compliance during the last 10 years. All spent nuclear fuel remains secure in an on-site dry storage facility.
In March 2021, at a quarterly public meeting of the SONGS Community Engagement Panel, SCE released the Strategic Plan for the Relocation of SONGS Spent Nuclear Fuel to an off-site storage facility or a repository. Concurrent with the release of the Strategic Plan, SCE announced the formation of Action for Spent Fuel Solutions Now, a coalition whose mission is to relocate. 
SONGS spent nuclear fuel to a federally licensed facility away from our coastline. The new group includes representation from environmental groups, labor leaders, Native American leaders, business organizations, local governments, utilities and community members. For more information, visit the SONGS website.
Biodiversity, Natural Habitat & Cultural Resource Protection. 
Biodiversity, natural habitat and cultural resource protections are key considerations for SCE as we modernize and update our grid infrastructure and execute on our Wildfire Mitigation Plan. Most of SCE’s service area falls within the California Floristic Province (CFP), one of over 30 areas in the world recognized by Conservation International as a biodiversity hotspot, with significant levels of biodiversity threatened by human habitation. The CFP has over 3,000 species of vascular plants, 60% of which occur only in California. In addition, California has more federal- and state-listed threatened and endangered species than any other state, except Hawaii. Approximately 40% of SCE’s utility corridors are located in areas that support threatened or endangered wildlife or plants and have become de facto wildlife corridors in many areas due to the surrounding urban development.
Protecting Endangered Species. 
SCE works year-round with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and other wildlife resource agencies to minimize impacts to endangered species. A few examples are as follows:
Yosemite toad is an endangered amphibian found in the Sierra Nevada region, home to. 
SCE's Big Creek Hydroelectric Plant. SCE scientists work with field personnel to put minimization and avoidance measures in place when performing work in the Yosemite toad’s habitat.
Desert tortoise, California’s official reptile, has seen its population shrink 90% in the last century. SCE developed a first-of-its kind programmatic raven management plan, in coordination with wildlife and land management agencies, to address issues of raven predation on the desert tortoise.
Pacific pocket mouse, a tiny, endangered burrowing mammal endemic to the immediate coast of Southern California, has been restricted to two locations due to urban development. The largest population is found on Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, where SCE has consulted with USFWS to protect Pacific pocket mouse habitat within SCE's transmission easement. The Biological Opinion also protects three other Endangered Species Act-listed species — arroyo toad, California gnatcatcher and least Bell’s vireo.
Western Joshua tree, one of the most iconic and abundant plants of the Mojave Desert, is a candidate for listing under the California Endangered Species Act. SCE has implemented strict measures to avoid impacts to the Western Joshua tree and has been working closely with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) to obtain permits authorizing trimming required to reduce the risk of wildfire from SCE electrical facilities.

SCE is committed to protecting special status species, their habitats, ecosystems and cultural resources where we operate. Efforts to protect and preserve cultural and tribal resources while supporting fire-hardening activities are part of larger programmatic permitting initiatives to streamline the environmental compliance process. In 2021, we began permitting with the USFWS and the CDFW for the San Bernardino Valley habitat conservation plan and long-term 2081 incidental take permits. SCE has also protected, enhanced or restored nearly 5,500 acres of land throughout our service area.
We use local, state and federal standards applicable to our service area to assess impacts on biodiversity. SCE implements best management practices (e.g., good housekeeping, crew trainings, covering tire tracks to discourage unauthorized re-entry, etc.) and resource-specific protection measures to minimize impacts to the natural environment. In some cases, SCE exceeds minimum regulatory requirements.
Every mitigation and restoration project has a detailed, project-specific approach to monitoring and assessment. Our assessment methodologies are based on the best available science and developed in partnership with resource agencies and other interested stakeholders to ensure their effectiveness. Mitigation and restoration efforts continue on every project until all qualitative and quantitative project performance and success criteria are achieved.
SCE’s primary goal is to avoid impacts to natural and cultural resources. Our. 
Environmental Resources division works with hundreds of consultants and environmental experts, including more than 100 nonprofit partners, to identify species and habitat resources, analyze potential effects, develop best management practices and conduct restoration efforts across our operational footprint. Additionally, SCE identifies and maps vegetation communities and sensitive ecosystems and uses avoidance measures to ensure the protection of wetlands, streams and riparian habitats, as well as other sensitive habitats. SCE minimizes unavoidable environmental impacts and consults with regulatory agencies to mitigate them and restore affected areas.
Our Environmental Services Department is on call 24 hours a day, seven days a week to respond to emergencies. When a large wildfire occurs in SCE’s service area, biologists and water-quality specialists are called out, along with crews to ensure that impacts to endangered species and their habitats are avoided or reduced, as well as to ensure agency coordination and that the correct permits are acquired to work in the area.
SCE’s biologists are dedicated to protecting species, habitats and ecosystems where the company operates and are engaged in efforts to protect species and streamline agency approval processes. We are also exploring the use of nonoperating properties for species conservation opportunities to offset impacts from projects and maintenance activities. For 34 years, SCE’s avian-protection program has protected endangered, migratory and other birds from electrocution, while also preventing power outages that can be caused by birds. In 2021, we developed guidance and provided training for our employees and contractors to protect nesting birds while performing important inspections of our infrastructure using unmanned aerial systems, also known as drones.
Community Engagement. 
SCE collaborates with local communities to identify and protect environmentally and culturally sensitive areas. We conduct environmental reviews and stakeholder engagement to identify potential biodiversity and community impacts and seek input from residents, businesses, landowners, tribal communities, local governments and other stakeholders to address and mitigate concerns. SCE participates in multistakeholder collaboration groups, such as the California Native Plant Society's Botanist Certification Advisory Group and the San Gabriel Mountains Community Collaborative, which are designed to improve biodiversity. Through Edison International's philanthropic funding, we also support programs in the communities we serves. Learn more about Community Investments.
Forestry. 
SCE manages 20,000 acres of Sierra Nevada forestland near Shaver Lake and Dinkey Creek, east of Fresno. For more than 40 years, SCE’s forestry staff have fostered and maintained a healthy forest.

At SCE’s Shaver Lake forest, we use historic information and leading research in forestry and ecology to help us restore the forest to a native structure, when fire was a natural part of the forest’s ecology. SCE’s goal is for the forest to become resistant to disease, bark beetles and catastrophic blazes that have become increasingly frequent and devastating in California due to increased fuel usage and climate change. The ongoing forest management practices of SCE's forestry team to maintain a healthy, resilient forest helped to deflect the devastating Creek Fire in 2020 and support firefighting crews.
SCE developed a plan in coordination with San Bernardino National Forest to manage fuel load related to SCE's vegetation management activities on U.S. Forest Service land. SCE’s efforts focus on healthy, diverse, wildfireresilient forest conditions and helping wildlife populations to thrive.
SCE Facilities & Supply Chain. 
In addition to our owned generation resources (see Owned Generation and Storage Assets), SCE maintains a real estate portfolio consisting of more than 1,300 buildings, including service centers, operations buildings, emergency response centers and traditional offices.
SCE owns the majority of these assets. SCE also maintains a transportation fleet of nearly 4,900 on-road vehicles, six helicopters, 1,100 trailers and 600 pieces of off-road equipment. In line with our strategic focus on electrification, we have set a 2030 goal to electrify a portion of our fleet (See Transportation Electrification), and we are working to increase electrification of our facilities (see Building Electrification). SCE also manages a supply chain of more than $2.4 billion, 38% of which was spent with diverse suppliers in 2021.
Forest Management Program. 
SCE’s forest management program includes methods to reduce the threat of wildfires, increase forest resiliency and support healthy forest growth.
• Strategically planting native trees and plants • Building firebreaks to help stop fires on or near utility land • Conducting prescribed burns to rid overgrown brush, small trees and dead material that could otherwise serve as fuel for a wildfire • Implementing an uneven-aged approach to forestry, where SCE removes mature trees, leaving room for young trees to grow. 
ENVIRONMENT (CONTINUED) ——
Facilities. 
SCE facilities use electric technologies in line with our strategic focus on electrification and run on 43% carbon-free power, consistent with SCE's grid. We also incorporate green-building attributes that reduce natural resource consumption and promote sustainable commuting by providing charging facilities and technologies to encourage the use of EVs.
Sustainable Buildings. 
SCE invested more than $2.7 million in 2021 for energy efficiency measures at our facilities. SCE’s building portfolio has one Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Platinum building — our Wildomar Service Center — two LEED Gold buildings and six LEED Silver buildings. The majority of our buildings are more than 40 years old, which maximizes our asset investments. In 2021, we installed a solar canopy for covered parking and EV charging at our Palm Springs Service Center in Cathedral City, California. We will continue to evaluate our sites for solar installations to further support our clean energy strategy.
Through SCE’s building management system, we control the temperature and lighting of facilities to minimize unnecessary energy use. We have retrofitted buildings with LED lighting; upgraded roofs to high-albedo materials, which keep buildings cooler by reflecting solar radiation; and implemented energy efficiency measures. In 2021, LED lighting upgrades across 18 SCE locations saved 1.1 million kilowatt hours (kWh) per year, reducing energy usage by 71% while increasing lighting levels by 58%. SCE also reduces energy consumption as facility.

In 2021, we replaced outdated electric heat pumps with more efficient ones across 34 SCE locations and expect to save more than 160,000 kWh annually. Older heat pump units typically contain R-22 hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC) refrigerant and are replaced with a non-CFC refrigerant, with a benign ozone-layer impact. Through facility upgrades, SCE captured and recycled 1,651 pounds of HCFC-containing refrigerant. We also recycled 80% of the removed heat pump equipment, which totaled 87,717 pounds.
Charging Stations to Support Employee Commutes. 
SCE supports employee EV adoption by providing charging infrastructure dedicated for employee use. In 2021, two-thirds of employees continued to work remotely, again reducing the need for EV-charging stations at SCE facilities. Nonetheless, we installed 110 new stations and maintained the infrastructure to ensure chargers are available to employees when they return to the office.
Supply Chain. 
SCE’s supply chain is an important extension of our operations. For the past 12 years, SCE has been a member of the Electric Utility Industry Sustainable Supply Chain Alliance, a collective formed to help reduce the environmental impact of the electric utility industry’s supply chain. Alliance members evaluate and share best practices across national peer utilities. Each year, we ask suppliers to complete the Alliance Supplier Sustainability Assessment. SCE monitors suppliers to ensure the completion of the survey and reviews the results to gauge supplier performance against industry peers. Areas of sustainability research with our suppliers include language used in requests for proposals to promote environmental action; supply chain emissions; Scope 3 carbon emissions goals; technologies to reduce SF6 emissions from gas insulated switchgears; human capital; supplier diversity; and environmental, social and governance performance tracking over time.
SCE undertook an assessment to begin quantifying supplier emissions. First, using our procurement spend and a U.S. Environmentally Extended Input-Output model from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, we estimated our Scope 3 emissions from our non-power delivery suppliers. Second, we informed certain suppliers about our efforts and asked them to provide their emissions directly into the Supplier Sustainability Assessment Tool. We will continue to engage our suppliers who have the largest impact upon our own Scope 3 emissions to improve our program.

To address workers who perform higher-risk activities near power lines, we have applied both mass marketing and targeted outreach, delivering collateral to businesses and reminding customers to hire qualified personnel when it comes to tree trimming safety.
Edison International sponsors Agents of Safety, a live stage production that reaches young people with electrical safety information, and Ready or Not: Preparing for Wildfires, a production for elementaryaged students, through a partnership with The National Theatre for Children (NTC). In 2021, both productions were again delivered virtually through the theatre’s livestreaming platform. NTC performed 77 livestream events for 68 schools and six Southern California-area Boys & Girls Clubs, reaching more than 20,000 students and 800 teachers.
Inclusivity in Emergency Preparedness. 
There is a heightened need to improve emergency preparedness for individuals with disabilities and access and functional needs. SCE participates in events and workshops that address public safety power shutoffs (PSPS) and how to better meet the needs of vulnerable communities through public, private and government collaboration.

Public Safety: Additional Details. 
Public Education Campaigns. 
SCE's safety campaign communication platforms include billboards, television and radio ads, digital and social media, search engine marketing, signage in stores and on SCE vehicles, community outreach and information distributed at community events.
In addition to tying content on our external website to safety, SCE’s social media channels helped amplify timely and critical safety information, including the launch of our E-Smart safety website and downed wire, outage and emergency preparedness tips. These efforts generated more than 56 million impressions across SCE’s social channels and allow us to continually deliver safety messaging to our customers that raise awareness of hazards in everyday activities.
In periods when metallic balloons are commonly used by the public for celebrations, presenting risks of contact with wires, our campaigns focus on reminding the public of the potentially adverse outcomes. Additionally, we communicate widely about downed wires across the SCE territory, encouraging the public to stay away and call 911.
Affordability: Additional Details. 
In 2021, SCE extended payment assistance programs and other forms of bill relief to customers affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, including to residential customers whose households increased energy usage due to working and schooling from home.
SCE is distributing $205 million in relief to help customers with past-due balances accrued between March 4, 2020 — the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic — through June 15, 2021. About 260,000 eligible SCE residential customers, including those enrolled in Community Choice Aggregators, received one-time credits in early 2022 to partially reduce their past-due balances. The funds being distributed to customers represent SCE’s allocation from the California Arrearage Payment Program, which is providing about $1 billion in federal funding from the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 to help with past-due energy bills. The program is administered by the state of California's Department of Community Services and Development (CSD). SCE has strongly advocated for state-funded arrearage relief for customers who have fallen behind on their bills during the pandemic.

Reliability: Additional Details. 
Outage Management to Ensure Reliable Power. 
Customers may experience outages that are either unplanned due to emergencies such as severe weather events, or planned so that SCE can perform grid maintenance or gridhardening and grid-modernization projects. SCE strives to inform customers and minimize impacts. When outages do occur, SCE works to keep customers updated in as close to real time as possible. We maintain an outage progress tracker on our website, which shows live service updates inputted by field crew through SCE’s Customer Crew Connect smartphone app.
SCE’s outage communication work was recognized in 2021 with Chartwell's "Sustained Leadership in Outage Communications" Award for our longtime commitment to continuous improvement of outage communications.
SCE uses advanced analytics, including artificial intelligence and machine learning, to provide real-time insights into grid health. Our Reliability Operations Center (ROC) creates algorithms using smart meter data that notify SCE of dozens of different wiredown scenarios, as well as their locations. The ROC has also developed several algorithms to detect the location of other issues, such as failing equipment, and hazards such as overloads due to energy theft. In such. 
CUSTOMERS (CONTINUED) —— cases, SCE dispatches a field technician to troubleshoot the problem. SCE also maintains an inventory of spare equipment, including poles, towers, transformers and other equipment to expedite replacement of damaged infrastructure during extreme weather events. In 2021, SCE saved an estimated 460,000 minutes of customer power interruption by proactively identifying and replacing damaged transformers.
SCE initiated a pilot in 2019 to help customers with solar plus storage systems, or with solar systems and plans to add storage, become resilient during PSPS events by funding the cost of microgrid controller equipment. Microgrids are selfcontained electric grids that can provide energy for a limited time and can operate both while tied to the larger grid and while separated from it. The controller equipment allows the customer to provide back-up power to a specified area on their campus during a power outage caused by weather, fire or other emergencies. Two customers have participated in the pilot — a high school and elementary school — and were asked to support their communities by either partnering with the American Red Cross to become an emergency shelter or agreeing to support SCE’s PSPS events by offering their site as a Community Resource Center during events.
We are also working with regulators, customers and other utilities to develop a framework to enable microgrids composed of multiple customer-sited distributed energy resources, as well as to explore additional microgrid pilots.
Reliability During the Pandemic. 
Throughout 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic continued to highlight community reliance on SCE’s role of powering frontline critical infrastructure sectors, such as hospitals, medical clinics, research facilities, public safety agencies, water districts and telecommunications networks. SCE continued to temporarily postpone noncritical projects requiring temporary power outages. For critical projects requiring an outage, we took additional steps to minimize the duration and impact, such as scheduling outages on weekends or overnight and increasing the number of crews on a project by reassigning them from noncritical work.
To make customers aware of critical, planned outages, SCE maintained COVID-19related, customer-facing information on our website and increased communications via live outbound calls, social channels and emergency response agencies. For longer outages that could cause food spoilage, we gave customers coupons for ice and provided $50 rebates for portable power stations.

California Independent System Operator (CAISO) Rotating Outages. 
CAISO rotating outages (Stage 3 CAISO Emergencies) become necessary when the state's electricity demand outpaces available supply in real time or are unavoidable. CAISO will typically order the state's investor-owned utilities, including SCE, to reduce electrical load by turning off service immediately. A rotating outage typically lasts one hour. We manage and rotate the outage across groups of customers throughout the service area to protect the integrity of our electric system, while limiting the inconvenience to any one customer or community. There were no such outages ordered in 2021.
SCE is working to update current demand response programs and implementing new pilots to meet statewide 2022 summer readiness objectives in support of system reliability (see Clean Energy).
Performance Metrics. 
SCE tracks reliability trends for unplanned outages and uses the information to inform grid planning and design. Our reliability performance is also reported to the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) annually. SCE benchmarks performance against other utilities using industry-standard reliability metrics. These metrics are defined by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. They exclude major event days, such as power outages due to natural or human-caused disasters exceeding a certain threshold for outage length. PSPS are included in all three metrics that SCE tracks.
Customer Experience. 
Customer Satisfaction. 
SCE solicits customer feedback to understand what is working and where we could be doing better. SCE tracks customer satisfaction using a range of benchmarks, including JD Power (for relative performance versus other large utilities in the electric industry) and Escalent's Trusted Brand and Customer Engagement study. This study includes nationwide residential and business customers of electric, natural gas or combination utilities and gathers insight into perceptions, experiences and satisfaction across demographics including age, gender, ethnicity, location and income level. Data gathered helps SCE assess performance relative to other utilities regionally and nationally, and lends insight around key customer choices, including billing options, payment methods, rate programs and energy sources, e.g., home solar.
Additionally, we engage a third party to administer a Customer Attitude Tracking online survey for statewide residential customers, including of other California investor-owned utilities, and SCE-only business customers. The residential survey is conducted in English, Spanish, Chinese, Korean and Vietnamese, with respondents screened to help ensure a demographically balanced sample set. Data is captured and reported monthly, and provides insight into brand favorability, opinions of creative ad execution, PSPS and public safety campaign awareness, and other perceptions of SCE.

Digital Tools to Improve the Customer Experience • Redesigned transportation electrification content for the business section of our website to allow customers to choose the optimal clean energy program for their needs • Electric vehicle charging station locations included in SCE’s new consolidated outage map on our website to help customers locate active stations during PSPS events • Dedicated web page for access and functional needs customers as a single source of information for wildfire preparedness • Persona modeling to analyze customer characteristics and demographics, such as land use and zoning or areas with high numbers of medical baseline customers, in high fire risk areas in order to be more proactive to critical needs during power outages • Speech analytics to quickly understand and respond to customer feedback during large customer-impacting events, like PSPS. 
Through our Voice of the Customer (VOC) survey, SCE collects daily feedback from over 1,000 customers on topics such as bill paying, power outages, our website and experiences with energy advisors at our customer contact centers. The VOC helps SCE understand whether our programs and services are meeting customers’ needs. Using that insight, we can help them make the right choices as energy consumers. Listening and responding in this way builds and sustains trust and favorability with our customers. Among other things, our VOC program also helps SCE to calculate our primary customer satisfaction metric (net score) on a -100 to +100 scale, gauging customer sentiment about transactional experiences with SCE (e.g., bill pay, bill questions).
In 2021, SCE made several customer experience enhancements, including by: • Enhancing the clarity and timeliness of outage notifications before, during and after PSPS events • Conducting comprehensive research to understand how we can improve our support for customers — particularly vulnerable populations — during PSPS (see Public Safety Power Shutoffs) • Investing in our ability to gauge customer satisfaction about vegetation management, service planning and transportation electrification to give customers the service they need • Linking VOC and customer satisfaction scores to circuits as an additional data point to determine where we invest in the grid.

WORKPLACE ——
Supporting Serious Injury and Fatality (SIF) Elimination Through Training. 
SCE promotes a holistic culture of safety by providing employees with regular skills and safety culture training, particularly for those who work in the field on higher-risk jobs. In 2021, we continued to deliver safety culture training to employees by integrating our safety culture training modules into new employee orientation and our field apprentice programs. We also provide employees safety culture refreshers to keep them abreast of key cognitive behavioral tools, which help them better identify and mitigate risk, and make safety choices that protect them. In addition, we continue to focus on providing our field employees with the technical knowledge, skills and ability to help them safely perform their job.
Training for our Transmission and Distribution (T&D) employees focuses on ensuring proper physical capabilities and enabling safe work practices. Training is reinforced and supplemented by verification of knowledge retention, as well as job aids and training materials. In 2021, SCE delivered approximately 30,000 total combined hours of T&D training to more than 8,000 employees, inclusive of employees attending multiple classes.
SCE's safety programs include training and instruction based on employee skillsets and/or job function, and use new tools and software.
Safety training and instruction may be required or offered based on three criteria: 1. As part of compliance training relative to the employee’s job function, e.g., first aid and cardiopulmonary resuscitation and automated external defibrillator certifications and tower rescue training 2. As part of the implementation of a new safety program, e.g., training on a new industrial ergonomic program or a new safety system, such as the Safety Predictive Model 3. As a refresher for compliance requirements or existing safety programs, e.g., Respiratory Protection, Protection from Wildfire Smoke, Valley Fever Awareness, Hearing Protection and Safety Culture Training workshops that integrate training on physical and psychological safety, along with core elements of our culture, such as diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) and the need to develop strong communication channels, for leaders across the organization. 
Contractor Safety. 
SCE’s safety culture extends to our contractors, especially contractors who perform higherrisk work. In 2021, SCE required these contractors to develop and implement safety culture training for their leaders. SCE uses prequalification and onboarding controls for contractors before work begins to reduce SIF. These components include a third-party assessment and mitigation plans. 
Edison International strives to create and maintain an environment rooted in safety and where all our team members are encouraged to bring their whole selves to work.
Safety: Additional Details. 
Employee and Contractor Safety: Additional Details. 
In 2021, COVID-19 continued to present a widespread safety concern for all employees and contractors. SCE has managed a comprehensive approach to COVID-19 exposure through a designated, crossfunctional team. This team supported COVID-19 response and enterprisewide changes to guidelines and protocols, and managed an unprecedented volume of cases brought on by a surge of the Omicron variant. The ongoing pandemic response resulted in the establishment of the Public Health & Industrial Hygiene organization, which will manage COVID-19 activities and develop longterm public health strategies for the company.
Hiring Safety-Minded Team Members. 
SCE has implemented workstyle assessments to support the hiring of safety-minded leaders and employees. These new hiring practices help the company select leaders and individual contributors who reflect and are aligned with safety and our other core values. In addition, SCE has one of the most comprehensive and effective employment-testing programs in the utility industry to ensure field craft workers perform at an exceptional level with safety as the top priority.

when needed. SCE also incorporates safety requirements into our requests for proposal.
SCE uses an industry best practice (Edison Electric Institute Safety Classification and Learning) model for classifying SIF and to assess contractors' safety performance. Business representatives ensure contractor safety incidents are reported while working for SCE. We analyze contractor safety performance data to identify trends, implement targeted approaches in areas of opportunity and set objectives for contractor safety performance.
SCE regularly communicates to our contractor workforce to raise awareness about safety. Some examples of our communications include weekly incident reports, significant safety events communications, construction methods publications, and tool and equipment recalls.
In the event of an injury, SCE's response may range from requiring the contractor to develop its own corrective action to reducing or terminating the contract based on the contractor's safety performance. SCE requires incident evaluation reports to be submitted for all incident severities and requires contractors to outline mitigation measures to prevent similar incidents from recurring.
WORKPLACE (CONTINUED) ——
Safety Performance Assessment. 
Edison International and SCE set annual corporate and organizational goals and targets that aim to eliminate SIF and reduce all injuries. We measure progress against these targets through safety performance metrics. We learn from individual incidents and potential incidents as well as collective trends to target areas of opportunity.
Promoting a Healthy and Rewarding Workplace. 
Recognizing and rewarding employee contributions with competitive pay and benefits, while also promoting a healthy work-life balance, contributes to the holistic well-being of employees. Employees may receive variable, performance-based pay linked to achievement of corporate and job-specific goals.
Edison International’s new Employee Stock Purchase Plan allows employees to purchase up to a maximum of $25,000 per year of Edison International common stock at a 3% discount through after-tax payroll deductions of between 1% and 10%.
We also offer employee benefits, including:1, 2 • A selection of health plans, such as medical, dental and vision benefits (including telemedicine and health advocacy services) • Life insurance plans • Short-term and long-term disability plans • Preventive health account reimbursement to encourage healthy lifestyle activity and help offset costs for items such as nutritionists, gym memberships and fitness classes • 401(k) savings plan with company match • Paid family leave of up to eight weeks, as well as a parental bonding supplement providing 100% salary replacement • Workplace lactation program for new mothers • Wellness programs and initiatives • Competitive vacation/holiday program • Professional development • Educational assistance • Volunteer programs • Employee assistance program and work life services • Matching gift program • Discounts on electric service, cellphone service and more. 
The COVID-19 pandemic continued to present health risks to our employees in their work environments. We therefore continued to extend health and wellness benefits, including additional paid leave due to illness or to care for family members. We again offered expanded availability of our telemedicine service provider to our represented workforce.
See Safety Performance and our Sustainability Scorecard for our enterprisewide safety performance.

Diversity, Equity & Inclusion: Additional Details. 
Building a Culture of Inclusion: Additional Details. 
Some of the common themes and activities that Operating Unit (OU) Culture Teams worked on in 2021 include: • Job Shadow programs to provide opportunities and insight for employee development. 
WORKPLACE (CONTINUED) —— • Leveraging business resource groups (BRGs) to assist in recruiting and outreach to diverse candidates and encouraging them to apply for job openings • Buddy Program where employees are paired with a new hire to help each new hire acclimate to their new working environment and feel included • Mentorships to provide collaborative relationships, professional development and personal growth to employees at all levels of the company • Virtual team-building events where employees share about themselves to promote trust, understanding and inclusion • Organized team volunteer days with local nonprofits • Exchange of best practice information to share successes and challenges. 
Governance and Transparency. 
We believe it is important to fully integrate DEI into our business with a C-suite executive who has the ultimate authority and responsibility to continue the progress we’ve made in pay, access, advancement and environment. Our Senior Vice President, Human Resources has executive responsibility for DEI. Our dedicated corporate DEI team provides thought leadership and cross-company collaboration in the development, leadership and execution of strategies, programs, tools and processes to build and sustain a culture of equity, inclusion and belonging at Edison International.
Human Rights. 
Employees of Edison International companies are almost entirely (99.9%) located in the United States.1 We operate in accordance with all applicable federal and international human rights laws and all eight of the International Labour Organization’s Fundamental Conventions. Edison International companies operate entirely within jurisdictions that have strict human rights standards embedded into law. In addition, through our Supplier Code of Conduct, we require our suppliers to abide by employment practices in line with our values, including but not limited to, equal opportunity and nondiscrimination; a prohibition on child labor and forced or compulsory labor; and meeting compliance requirements associated with working hours, wage and benefits, and freedom of association.
DEI Training and Education. 
Edison International invests in education and training to provide employees with skills and resources to activate DEI in their dayto-day interactions and decisions. In 2021, we introduced inclusion and cultural literacy training, a required training that covers topics related to diversity, inclusive/exclusive behaviors, unconscious bias, psychological safety and belonging. We expanded our current curriculum to include content on DEI for all employees. In accordance with our corporate goal, all active employees (not on leave) completed this new DEI training by year-end 2021. For more details on Edison International’s enterprisewide training program, see Employee Training.

Racial/Ethnic Diversity. 
We compare the diverse representation of our workforce against labor market availability and the composition of the communities we serve. Labor market availability is calculated by taking the latest census data to give a sense of the reporting working-age population in a local or national area, depending on occupational census codes that align with the skills of our employees.1 Relevant availability for executives is national, but local for leaders and workforce, based on where we typically source candidates. Comparisons are helpful in determining where we might address larger societal issues, such as socioeconomic factors that can limit access to higher education, through grantmaking or community programs.
A Focus on Gender Parity. 
Representing 32% of the workforce, our female colleagues mitigate wildfires, maintain field operations, assist customers and drive our clean energy strategy, among other roles. They represent the top talent in our industry and are at the heart of Edison International’s success. Our commitment to hiring qualified women and advancing their opportunities in our workforce has never been stronger.
We are working to achieve gender parity in executive roles by 2030, a goal we set in 2016 when we joined Paradigm for Parity, a coalition of business leaders dedicated to addressing the leadership gender gap in corporate America. Sustaining our progress toward gender parity will depend in part on broader societal trends, including the diversity of our candidate pool.
WORKPLACE (CONTINUED) ——
We partner with organizations that advance gender equality in society, including: • Association of Women in Water, Energy and. 
Environment, an organization dedicated to supporting women’s professional growth in our industry • Catalyst, a global nonprofit that helps leading companies accelerate and advance women through pioneering research, practical tools and proven solutions • Fairygodboss, a leading career community for women. 
To engage our male colleagues in gender inclusion, in 2021 we launched Men Advocating Real Change (MARC), a voluntary allyship program led by our DEI team and Women’s Roundtable BRG. MARC fosters a culture of support and inclusion by inspiring men to leverage their unique opportunity and responsibility to be allies. More than 100 team members have already joined a MARC discussion group.
Workforce Attraction, Development & Engagement: Additional Details. 
Edison International employees contribute to a positive culture within the company through culture teams designed to engage them in building an inclusive environment. The culture teams focus on DEI, SCE values and other culture-related initiatives.
Attraction. 
SCE employees partner with several professional and community associations which provide them with an opportunity to build their own networks as well as meet diverse talent.
These associations include, among others: • Society of Women Engineers (SWE) • Society of Hispanic Professional. 
Engineers (SHPE) • National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE) • Asian American Professional. 
Association (AAPA) • American Association of Blacks in Energy (AABE) • Native American Tribes, specifically the 13 Tribal. 
Nations within the SCE service area. 
BRG Involvement. 
We leverage our BRGs to connect with diverse groups across SCE’s service area. For example, in 2021: • Through Networkers, the Black Male Initiative was formed to partner with community, spiritual and nonprofit organizations to help promote SCE job opportunities and career paths to members of their organizations • Latinos for Engagement, Advancement &
Development (LEAD) members presented to Latino student and community groups on resume writing best practices and interview preparation • Native American Alliance hosted a virtual career expo for its members where attendees heard about job opportunities and practical advice for interview preparation. 
The largest minority group in America is people with disabilities, and we see this as an untapped pool of talent. We are committed to providing an environment for all employees that is free of barriers and biases. To help achieve this, our Abilities Beyond Limits and Expectations (ABLE) BRG provides awareness to create understanding around disabilities. We also work to continuously improve accessibility in our offices and technology.

WORKPLACE (CONTINUED) ——
Building Pipeline of Black Talent. 
While the number of Black employees at Edison International continues to exceed labor market availability, we understand the need to drive toward a more representative labor market overall. Our DEI commitments included actions intended to continue to develop a robust pipeline of Black talent, as well as focusing on development and advancement opportunities throughout our organization, and improving the overall labor market representation through partnerships with dedicated organizations and scholarship opportunities.
University Partnerships. 
In 2021, we launched two new strategic partnerships with two Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Howard University and North Carolina A&T, to engage diverse students and professionals in our recruitment activities.
Lineworker Scholarship. 
In 2020, Edison International committed $1 million in shareholder funding to pilot a four-year annual scholarship program supporting lineworker students. The purpose of this program is to grow diversity in the lineworker role with an initial focus on attracting Black participants, who are underrepresented in lineworker positions.
Industry Collaboration. 
Edison International is a long-standing sponsor of American Association of Blacks in Energy (AABE) though our supplier diversity team, and we have had several executives serve on AABE’s national board. We participate in. 
AABE’s Energy Equity Campaign to increase Black representation in the energy industry through business contracting and workforce development. Additionally, several Edison International employees are AABE members, and the AABE California Chapter is led by our employees.
Filling Roles with Internal Candidates. 
Despite an increase in 2021 over 2020, at 7.5%, our employee turnover rate was lower than that of our peers in the electric utility industry and other industries. While this is a good indicator of satisfaction and positive experiences among employees, having fewer open positions presents a challenge to advancing workforce diversity. In 2021, 69.6% of new roles were filled by internal candidates.
Summer Interns. 
We see the value of early career talent programs and recruit students through programs like Edison International and SCE's internship, recent graduate and MBA talent programs. The summer internship program generally runs for 10 to 12 weeks and gives students hands-on experience with SCE’s projects, supplying mentoring from senior leaders and company peers.
Edison International and SCE's 2021 internship program was fully virtual again, as the COVID-19 pandemic continued to prevent in-person opportunities. Students were able to integrate into their departments, thanks to the infrastructure and remote working culture the company established at the start of the pandemic.
Student interns develop skills needed for full-time roles within the company following graduation. Edison International and SCE's summer 2020 intern conversion to full-time roles in 2021 was 59%, exceeding the 2020 national average of 55.5% according to the National Association of Colleges & Employers.
Summer intern conversions in 2021 are currently in process and will continue throughout the 2022 year as students graduate.
Workforce Development. 
Edison International offers employees rewarding careers that are enriched by development opportunities at all levels of the organization. These opportunities include formal programs and training that help employees build a foundation for advancement while learning about the values we uphold in all our business operations, as well as ad-hoc initiatives that support employees’ short-term career goals.
Annual Performance and Development Process. 
We have an annual performance and development process, which begins with all full-time, nonrepresented employees and their managers working together to create a set of business and development goals to foster professional and personal advancement. Managers and employees then engage in structured ongoing conversations throughout the year where progress on performance and development goals is regularly discussed and updated.

WORKPLACE (CONTINUED) ——
Engagement. 
We conduct pulse surveys throughout the year, seeking input from each employee once annually, to understand what employees think is working and where we can improve. This survey includes questions pertaining to DEI and tracks employee sentiment on trust, engagement, the work itself, growth and development and inclusion.
In 2021, 88% of employees indicated that they are proud to work at Edison International and 84% said their jobs make good use of their skills and abilities. We continued to see positive year-over-year trends among almost all employee groups and strengths in the areas of trust, engagement and the work itself. However, surveys indicate there is still work to do to improve recognition and facilitate career growth and development opportunities for all employees.
In 2021, two of our DEI Commitments — the Talent Development Accelerator and Career Counseling — directly addressed growth and development opportunities. With regard to collaboration, in 2022, to achieve our DEI corporate goal, each of our OUs will create a DEI Action Plan focused on specific areas of need within their OU. Several have chosen collaboration as a focus area.
Demonstrating the Company’s Values. 
Edison International’s values define the company and how we work. To promote and reinforce our values, Edison International and SCE have more than 95 employee representatives who work to positively influence change within their departments and locations. Selected by local and senior leadership, these “Values Ambassadors” reinforce values-based behavior, direct employees to company resources and provide context about companywide change and culture initiatives. Values Ambassadors also provide Ethics and Compliance and Human Resources with input and insight into company culture, and they align efforts within each department’s culture team.
The Edison Award. 
The Edison Award is the company’s most prestigious award and is presented approximately every two years. Employees nominate their peers, and the company awards them for their contributions to Edison International’s culture, outstanding performance and living the company’s values and guiding behaviors every day. Due to an inability to celebrate in person during the pandemic, we delayed the 2021 award to 2022.
Formal Complaint Escalation Process. 
We are committed to fostering an environment of open, honest communications. We have instituted multiple formal mechanisms to promote an open feedback culture, including a process that encourages reporting work environment, policy violation and noncompliance issues through management, Human Resources, Ethics and Compliance, the Edison HelpLine and other various channels.
The Edison HelpLine offers confidential and anonymous reporting by phone, website and our employee mobile application. Our nonrepresented employees (other than certain leadership positions) have access to an alternative dispute resolution process (Focus on Resolution) whereby they can request a review of a specific corrective action (e.g., written warning, final written warning, suspension or demotion) or performance review and related investigation to determine if the corrective action or performance review was appropriate. Our represented employees have specific grievance reporting and escalation procedures as outlined in their collective bargaining agreements.
Union Partnerships. 
About one-third of SCE’s employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. SCE and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) Local 47 partnered to implement the IBEW Code of Excellence (COE), a program that emphasizes safety, high-quality work and craftsmanship. The COE, which reinforces SCE’s longstanding company values, provides a set of expectations about employees’ duties and behaviors on the job. All IBEW members are held to these expectations and hold their peer members accountable to strict standards.

GOVERNANCE —— Good governance is the foundation of Edison International’s business and critical to our success.
Corporate Governance. 
Edison International’s corporate governance, risk management, compliance practices and security protocols reflect our ongoing commitment to responsible conduct and transparent engagement with stakeholders.
Board of Directors. 
Edison International’s Board of Directors provides independent oversight of the management of the organization with a focus on long-term value, considering the interests of its stakeholders. Edison International’s directors are elected annually by the company’s shareholders. All directors other than Edison International’s President and CEO are independent.
Among its primary responsibilities, the Board oversees company strategy, financial performance, safety, enterprise risk management (ERM), and ethics and compliance programs. Guiding the activities of the Board are its Corporate Governance Guidelines, which outline the Board’s policies for overseeing the company. The Board performs a self-evaluation annually to ensure it and its committees are functioning effectively.
Risk Management. 
Edison International and SCE ERM process is designed to identify, anticipate and provide. 
Learn More About the Board's: • ESG Oversight • Risk Management Oversight • Cybersecurity Oversight • Political Contributions Oversight • Board Diversity. 
Please also refer to Edison International's 2022 Proxy Statement for further information.
oversight of significant business risks, assess risk management options, and develop and select risk mitigation and response activities.
Operating one of the country’s largest utilities brings unique risks in addition to those faced by any large enterprise or public company. Many of the key risks managed by ERM are discussed elsewhere in this report and in Edison International’s Annual Report on Form 10-K and Proxy Statement, including wildfire, cybersecurity, pandemic, public and workforce safety, and climate change mitigation and adaptation. Risks related to environmental, social and governance issues remain a priority for ERM and are reviewed alongside many other factors when evaluating each of the company’s enterprise risks. ERM presents the risks to the Audit and Finance Committee of Edison International’s Board of Directors at least annually and participates in ensuring that all financially material risks are disclosed in Edison International's U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings.
Edison Energy's1 Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing a risk management process for Edison Energy. ERM reviewed Edison Energy's risk management framework for consistency with Edison International and SCE's program.
Risk Oversight. 
Edison International’s Board of Directors has broad responsibility for the oversight of significant risks, including those related to strategy, operations, finance and reputation.
The Board actively reviews our ERM process and monitors significant risks. The Board exercises this responsibility through direct engagement with management and through its committees, which regularly report back to the Board.
The Audit and Finance Committee provides oversight of the ERM department’s overall process and risk assessment report (an annual review of significant risks, classified into three tiers: key, secondary and emerging), as well as reporting risk. The Safety and Operations Committee provides oversight of emergent operational risks and operational mitigation of risks. The Compensation and Executive Personnel Committee reviews executive compensation risks with analysis provided by independent consultants. The Nominating and Governance Committee identifies director candidates with skills and experience 1 Edison Energy is not the same company as Southern California Edison, the utility, and Edison Energy is not regulated by the California Public Utilities Commission.

GOVERNANCE (CONTINUED) —— to oversee the ERM process. For more information, please see Edison International's 2022 Proxy Statement, pp. 26–27.
The ERM Department also engages senior Edison International and SCE leadership on emergent and ongoing risk issues through various management committees. These committees include the SCE Risk Management Working Group, a management forum designed to integrate operations and risk and provide a common framework for decision-making; the SCE Finance and Risk Management Committee where ERM is chartered to provide risk input and lead risk discussions regarding the utility; and the Edison International Managing Committee1, which has overall oversight of ERM process and the key risks of the company.
Risk Identification and Prioritization. 
In addition to ongoing management of known risks, we have established a standardized risk intake process to identify new potential risks from a wide variety of sources, including operations within the company; connections with corporate functions, including Audits and Regulatory, as well as other groups who participate in managing risk and responding to risk events, including Business Resiliency, Safety, Cyber and Physical Security, Environmental Services and Operational Finance; and research, benchmarking and surveys performed both internally and externally.
In 2021, the ERM Department enhanced the risk intake process by formalizing approved triggers for when a department-identified issue must be risk-evaluated prior to decisionmaking. Triggers meet any of a set of criteria, including relation to the company’s exposure to known risks, significant risk model/prioritization changes or projects that exceed an expenditure threshold. ERM performs a preliminary risk assessment on triggered risks, determines risk analysis requirements, updates the Enterprise Risk Register, and establishes the stakeholders and processes for completing the necessary risk analysis and assuring that risks are managed and monitored.
The next step in the process after risk identification is risk prioritization. A common set of risk terms and tools is used to prioritize risks based on comparable attributes, including likelihood and consequence of potential events. ERM also provides a risk-informed perspective to the development of company strategy, and the strategic risks of the company are accounted for in the enterprise risk register.
To ensure business continuity in spite of growing uncertainties, SCE evaluates, monitors and mitigates supply chain risks for both materials and services. Despite economywide supply chain challenges in 2021 — primarily due to labor shortages — SCE had insignificant material supply chain disruptions, thanks to mitigation efforts that saw us work with vendors and manufacturers to ensure we had sufficient inventory to meet business needs through 2021. In 2022, the supply chain risk landscape continues to change rapidly due to inflation, global conflict, COVID-19 disruptions and other factors, which are closely monitored and/or mitigated through Edison’s ERM process.
Risk Mitigation. 
ERM follows a comprehensive protocol to mitigate risks across our operations, with a distinct focus on public safety, operational and hazard risks. Detailed mitigation deployment plans are developed for enterprise risks, and risk review requirements are now incorporated into the charters of various Edison International and SCE management committees across the company. ERM's process builds upon ratemaking requirements from the California Public Utilities Commission in the Safety Model Assessment Proceeding (S-MAP) and Risk Assessment Mitigation Phase (RAMP) filings. SCE’s 2022 RAMP report analyzes key safety risks, including wildfires, climate change and cybersecurity threats. It will inform expenditures requested through the first track of SCE's 2025 General Rate Case, filed in 2023.
Findings from our Climate Adaptation Vulnerability Assessment and feedback from our Community Engagement Plan are factored into the ERM process and the 2022 RAMP report. Risk analysis is also a major component of SCE’s Wildfire Mitigation Plans.
Risk monitoring and verification activities, as well as risk issues that occur during project and program execution of risk mitigation deployment plans, are monitored by ERM and its oversight committees. Standardized risk analysis summaries are required to be included in support materials used in senior leadership decision forums. ERM is responsible for ensuring risks are considered in decisions about the company’s business 1 The Edison International Managing Committee consists of the most senior Edison International and SCE executive officers. Edison International members include the President and CEO, Executive Vice President (EVP) and. 
Chief Financial Officer, EVP and General Counsel and the Senior Vice President (SVP) of Strategy, Corporate Development and Sustainability.

Furthermore, ERM works with the internal audit department and various quality-control functions embedded in the business to provide risk insights into the development of the scope of assurance verifications performed by those groups. Senior ERM and departmental leadership also provide support for assurance. The risk management process informs the annual audit plan.
The ERM, Insurance and Legal teams work together to reduce potential legal claims against the company. This includes loss control assessments, trending of claims and near misses and procurement of insurance for general liability, wildfire, property damage, workers compensation, aviation and others. In addition, we regularly review and update thirdparty agreements for appropriate minimum insurance limits and indemnity provisions to limit the company’s exposure to claims against our vendors and contractors.
Cyber & Physical Security: Additional Details. 
Security at Edison International supports grid reliability by protecting our people, facilities, systems and data; mitigating the risk posed by potential threats; deploying state-of-theart monitoring technologies; providing timely response to incidents; and maintaining a close collaboration of shared intelligence across local, state and federal government agencies. We do this while also cultivating a culture of security.
To defend against a dynamic threat landscape, we implement a multilayered strategy called “defense in depth.” The strategy combines physical and cybersecurity awareness education, security countermeasures, and close coordination among industry and government partners at all levels to prepare, respond and recover in the event that an incident impacts the grid.
The electric power sector must also meet mandatory regulatory requirements for cybersecurity. This ensures a consistent set of standards and requirements across the industry. However, regulatory requirements are only a baseline. SCE leverages tools such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cyber Security Framework and maturity models such as the US Department of Energy’s Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model to continually improve our efforts across the board.
SCE increases situational awareness of the security of our assets and secures our sites against trespassing, vandalism and theft. We collaborate with local law enforcement to investigate and prosecute crimes against our facilities to deter future incidents. Only authorized personnel can access facilities and critical areas by using electronically encoded identification badges.
Employee, Contractor and Supplier Awareness. 
Our employees play an important role in protecting our system. To increase employee awareness, Edison International provides annual training courses about our physical and cybersecurity policies and procedures, and simulates phishing exercises and other scenarios. This training covers potential threats, such as suspicious emails and websites, and is equipped to defend against cyberattacks and to recognize unauthorized attempts of physical access.
Edison International also has processes and procedures for suppliers, vendors and other business partners to strengthen their security postures.
Cyber and Physical Security Standards and Requirements. 
SCE is subject to the North American Electricity Reliability Corporation Critical Infrastructure Protection Standards, which are designed to secure the assets required to operate North America’s bulk electric system.
SCE leverages globally applied frameworks and standards, including the NIST Cyber Security Framework, Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design and the American National Standards Institute, which are used to protect facilities and assets.
Cyber and Physical Security Oversight. 
Edison International’s Board of Directors provides oversight and receives regular cybersecurity-related updates. The Board has assigned primary responsibility for cybersecurity operations oversight to its Safety and Operations Committee, which receives regular cybersecurity updates from SCE's Chief Information Officer and SCE’s Vice President (VP) of Cybersecurity.

GOVERNANCE (CONTINUED) ——
Board also receives an annual report on cybersecurity from SCE’s Chief Information Officer, SCE's VP of Cybersecurity and an independent cybersecurity consultant that includes an assessment of the company’s program and organization, as well as the cyber risk landscape. Briefings are provided to Board members on specific security topics during meetings of the full Board and the Board's Safety and Operations Committee, including information about the dynamic physical and cybersecurity threat landscape and Edison International’s defense and risk mitigation strategies. Physical and cybersecurity risks are included in key enterprise risk reports to the Board and the Board’s Audit and Finance Committee, which receives reports from the general auditor on cyber- and physical security-related audit findings.
Additional aspects of Edison International’s physical and cybersecurity programs receive oversight from other senior leadership committees to ensure that these programs effectively, appropriately and responsibly address identified risks from a holistic and broad perspective for the company. For example, management has established a cybersecurity oversight group comprised of a multidisciplinary senior leadership team to provide governance and strategic direction for the identification of and response to cybersecurity risks. The Board has identified a liaison who regularly attends. Other Board members are invited to attend meetings and typically attend at least one meeting annually.
Industry and Government Partnerships. 
At Edison International, we monitor systems and protect against cyber and physical threats 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. Given the evolving nature of these threats, partnerships and information sharing among peer electric companies, government agencies and other trusted organizations is critical.
One important partnership is with the CEO-led Electricity Subsector Coordinating Council (ESCC). The ESCC is the principal liaison between federal government leaders and the electric power sector and facilitates the preparation of action plans in response to national critical infrastructure threats.
Edison International is an industry leader in partnering with governments through the ESCC, which develops a unified response to all hazards, including cyber or physical attacks. Specifically, we work to identify and break down barriers to industry/government cooperation during technical-, legal- or policy-based national emergencies. We have also led efforts to foster greater information sharing and collaboration between the federal government and utilities through the development of an all-purpose cooperation agreement.
Edison International is also a member of the Analysis & Resilience Center, a cross-sector coalition to reduce systemic risk to the critical functions that underpin our economy and national security. Edison International President and CEO Pedro Pizarro serves on the board.
Edison is a participating member of several state and federal regulatory agencies tasked with ensuring the security and reliability of our electric infrastructure. We serve as part of advisory groups to extend best practices across our industry nationwide. We are involved with collaborative groups established by local, state and federal agencies to promote the exchange of security and intelligence information between the public and private sector.
Finally, we also validate our security plans and infrastructure by participating in broad internal and multiagency exercises, such as the Grid Security Exercise (GridEx), which allows stakeholders from across the electricity industry and federal agencies to respond to simulated cyber and physical attacks that affect the reliable operation of the grid.
Ethics & Compliance. 
Edison International expects our employees and contractors to act ethically and to follow all relevant laws and regulations.
Compliance Effectiveness. 
To ensure compliance standards are upheld throughout the organization, Edison International maintains a Compliance Management Framework designed to prevent and detect noncompliance. As part of this framework, we conduct compliance risk rankings and assessments, program maturity reviews, supplier screening and due diligence for mergers and acquisitions. We also benchmark our compliance program against Department of Justice guidelines and other companies, and we use outside entities to assess program effectiveness.

Ethics and Compliance partners with Human Resources to develop innovative training solutions that provide engaging user experiences and content, while meeting our legal, regulatory and company-mandated obligations. In 2021, employees on average completed one hour of ethics and compliance training with 100% of active employees completing mandatory training.
Edison HelpLine. 
Edison International encourages employees to seek advice or report misconduct through several channels, including by contacting their supervisors or the Edison HelpLine, a 24/7 service staffed by dedicated operators. When contacting the HelpLine, employees can identify themselves or remain anonymous. We do not tolerate retaliation against anyone for making a report or seeking advice. Edison International also deploys a periodic culture survey to help ensure an ethical and compliant culture.
Edison International investigates reports of alleged ethics and compliance violations. The Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer (CECO) reports to the Board’s Audit and Finance Committee on the status of HelpLine calls and investigations at least quarterly, in addition to reporting on the effectiveness of the ethics and compliance program and other responsibilities of the CECO. In the event of substantiated allegations, we take corrective action that may include oral reprimand or other discipline up to and including termination.
Codes of Conduct Employee Code of Conduct. 
Edison International’s Employee Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for ethical behavior in the workplace. Edison International requires employees to take part in regular training sessions and certify annually that they comply with the Code.
Supplier Code of Conduct. 
Edison International’s Supplier Code of Conduct (SCOC) outlines our expectations that our suppliers, as well as their employees and subcontractors, adhere to Edison International’s ethics and compliance standards. The SCOC also reflects principles and standards recognized and implemented across a range of industries.
Ethics and Compliance Code for the Board Directors. 
Edison International’s Ethics and Compliance Code for Directors outlines how members of the Board are expected to conduct themselves. The Code covers topics such as conflicts of interest, confidentiality and fair dealing. The Board also receives regular ethics and compliance oversight training conducted by Edison International’s CECO.
Ethics@Work Mobile Application. 
Employees can use the Ethics@Work app to access guidance from Edison International’s Code of Conduct and company policies, as well as find useful resources and report concerns to the Edison HelpLine.
Third-Party Reputational Screening. 
As part of our Compliance Management Framework, Edison International regularly screens suppliers and other third parties to detect reputational and compliance risks.
The company’s screening and monitoring service scans more than 120,000 sources across 240 countries in 70 languages. The service checks globally for sanctions against third parties and organizations that have been placed on government watchlists. It also scans for adverse media coverage. In cases where issues are found, Edison International takes corrective action, up to and including termination of a relationship. In 2021, we monitored more than 4,000 third parties.
Post-Investigation Survey. 
We ask for feedback on our misconduct investigation process at Edison International and SCE through a post-investigation survey aimed at driving continuous process improvement. As a result of feedback received from these surveys, we have revised our processes and improved communication between investigators and investigation participants.
Policy Updates. 
Edison International periodically reviews all corporate policies to ensure that they remain current and implements changes based on lessons from audits and current events.

GOVERNANCE (CONTINUED) ——
Information Governance. 
To protect Edison International’s confidential information, we maintain a combination of policy, procedure and technical controls. To manage rapidly growing information volumes and changing formats, we deployed standards and procedures to help employees appropriately store, access and share company information. Edison International has also established companywide standards to improve data quality, including monitoring and remediation of high-risk repositories. Our records retention schedule guides employees with retention and disposition decisions.
Political Activities. 
Political developments at the federal, state and local level can have a significant impact on the company and our stakeholders. Edison International believes it is the company’s responsibility to participate in the political process, consistent with our values, by advocating to elected officials and making contributions to candidates, parties and political action committees that support policies that help advance our business strategy, related to clean energy and efficient electrification. See Trade Associations for more information on how our policy positions align with the trade associations of which we are members.
Edison International supports candidates and committees that understand the importance of financially healthy businesses to advance policy priorities such as delivering clean energy. The company will only make political contributions that comply with the law and adhere to our Political Contribution Policy, including a rigorous values review. Following the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Edison International revised the policy to more explicitly align our political engagement to our values, business strategy and key policy areas related to healthy democracy, pro-business, energy and sustainability.
All contributions must be independently reviewed by outside political law counsel and then approved by the most senior officer responsible for government affairs or the Edison International President and CEO. As a best practice for effective corporate governance, the Board of Directors’ Audit and Finance Committee annually reviews our Political Contribution Policy and compliance program, and receives semiannual reports on the company’s political expenditures to ensure alignment with our values, business strategy and key policy areas.
Edison International makes payments to 501(c)(4) organizations, which under the Internal Revenue Code are permitted to participate in some political campaign, legislative and political educational activities. Since 2013, the Edison International Managing Committee has required that contributions provided to 501(c)(4) entities not be used for lobbying, political purposes or to pay any government official (including travel expenses). Edison International requires year-end confirmation that 501(c)(4) organizations that received contributions certify that they adhered to this prohibition. In 2021, all 501(c)(4) organizations receiving payments from the company complied with this requirement.
Transparent Political Engagement. 
Edison International is transparent about our political contributions and publicly discloses them on our website. In 2021, the company was again recognized as a “Trendsetter” (highest rating) by the Center for Political Accountability, an independent nonprofit, nonpartisan organization, for our commitment to transparency and accountability in corporate political spending. This is the sixth consecutive year that Edison International has received this recognition.
Lobbying. 
Edison International ethically communicates with elected and appointed officials and members of their staffs about our policy priorities. We follow all lobbying registration and disclosure requirements for influencing legislative or administrative action. All employees and consultants registered to lobby for the company must complete political activities compliance and ethics training annually.

NET-ZERO COMMITMENT. 
GOAL: Achieve net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across Scopes 1, 2 and 3 by 2045, in alignment with economywide climate actions planned by the State of California. This covers the power SCE delivers to customers and Edison International’s enterprisewide operations, including supply chain.
See Carbon Footprint for more details about our performance.
SUSTAINABILITY GOALS —— 1 This chart shows a projection of Edison International's enterprisewide emissions in 2030 and 2045 based on assumptions aligned with SCE's Pathway 2045 white paper. Factors that could impact the emissions estimates include, among others, fluctuations in SCE-bundled load due to community choice aggregation formation in SCE's service area and uptake of electric technologies, variability in economic dispatch of Mountainview and SCE's other gas generation resources for system reliability purposes, and the availability of new technologies and innovation that affect emissions.
2 Meeting this net-zero goal is contingent on approvals from SCE's regulators, as well as the availability of viable technologies in 2045 to adequately offset or remove remaining carbon from our enterprisewide footprint.
3 The 2021 emissions inventory is an estimate. It also includes as an input “retail sales,” which was calculated using a different methodology in 2021 compared to prior years. Please see footnotes on p. 14 for more details.
4 Edison International’s Scope 3 emissions reporting continues to evolve. In 2020 and 2021 it included the following emissions sources: specified and unspecified power purchases to serve SCE customers, an estimate of Edison. 
International and SCE's supply chain, and enterprisewide employee commuting and business travel. Other Scope 3 emissions categories may be relevant to Edison International and this commitment that are not included here.
Any remaining emissions in 2045 to be offset or removed2.

CLEAN ENERGY TRANSITION. 
GOAL: Deliver 100% carbon-free power in terms of retail sales to SCE customers by 20451 1 Edison International’s Clean Energy Transition goal is aligned with state of California law, in particular California Public Utilities Code Section 454.53(a), which became law through Senate Bill (SB) 100 on September 10, 2018.
It relates to the power SCE delivers to customers, in terms of retail sales, which is a combination of SCE’s utility-owned generation and purchased power. The GHG emissions metric covers the relevant portion of Scope 1 and Scope 3 emissions related to SCE's utility-owned generation and purchased power.
2 Note that retail sales do not include line losses in accordance with California statute. SCE estimates line losses of up to approximately 10% in 2045.
3 2020 delivered power mix data and associated emissions reflect final data from SCE’s PSDP filing in June 2021, as well as other refined data inputs, and have been updated from the estimate shown in the 2020 Sustainability. 
Report. "Carbon-free Power as a Percentage of Retail Sales" remained unchanged at 43%. "GHG Emissions Actual and Projected (MMT CO2e)" was updated from 13.5 to 12.4 (see note 7 for additional factor) and "GHG Emissions Intensity Actual and Projected (MT CO2e/MWh)" was updated from 0.23 to 0.21.
4 In 2021, SCE updated its “retail sales” accounting to net out excess generation stemming from net-energy metering customers who generate power through rooftop solar and sell the excess back to the grid. This reduces. 
SCE’s retail sales by approximately 3% and has the downstream effect of reducing, from an accounting perspective, the amount of “unspecified” energy SCE purchases on behalf of customers and those associated emissions. It also increases, from an accounting perspective, the proportion of specified resources, such as RPS-eligible energy, in SCE’s retail sales. This updated approach more accurately reflects the load served and power purchased on behalf of and sold to SCE customers. Prior year metrics have not been updated, however, and a year-over-year comparison is not feasible.
5 This is an estimate of SCE’s 2021 delivered power mix using the methodology prescribed by the CEC's PSDP as of April 2, 2022. SCE’s final PSDP report will be filed with the CEC on June 1, 2022 and may include data that differs from the estimate shown here to reflect subsequent changes or clarifications to PSDP's methodology and reporting template. Numbers do not sum due to rounding.
6 This projection is dependent on variable factors, including, but not limited to, SCE’s load size, weather and other conditions affecting peak demand, GHG emissions and retail sale accounting rules in the state of California, and regulatory approvals for procurement. SCE reviews and updates, as needed, this projection annually.
7 The 2019 and 2020 values for "GHG Emissions Actual and Projected (MMT CO2e)" of delivered power in terms of retail sales to SCE customers have been restated from 11.8 to 11.0 and 13.5 to 12.4 respectively. Edison. 
International's 2020 Sustainability Report inadvertently listed Edison International's full carbon footprint, reflecting Scopes 1, 2 and 3, as opposed to the portion of GHG emissions derived from delivered power only, which covers a portion of Scope 1 and Scope 3.
8 SCE anticipates that the GHG emissions and GHG emissions intensity of its delivered power in terms of retail sales will be at or near zero in 2045. There may still be carbon-emitting resources in the system, however, as outlined in note 2. While retail sales would be considered carbon-free, any residual carbon-emitting resource in the system would result in Scope 1, 2 and/or 3 emissions above zero.
9 This projection is based on SCE’s sector-specific GHG emissions target prescribed by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) and aligned with the California Air Resources Board's (CARB) 2017 Scoping Plan. It uses public data as an input, including related to the California Energy Commission Integrated Energy Policy Report and CPUC Integrated Resource Plan. The methodology used to project future emissions differs from the methodology used to calculate historical emissions, which is based on The Climate Registry GHG emissions reporting protocols.

ELECTRIFICATION. 
GOAL: By 2024, obtain SCE customer commitments to deploy 8,490 medium- and heavy-duty electric vehicles at 870 sites through SCE’s Charge Ready Transport program1 1 This goal is tied to SCE’s Charge Ready Transport application, which was approved on May 31, 2018. The program was formally launched on May 20, 2019.
2 This goal is tied to SCE’s Charge Ready Pilot, approved on January 25, 2016; the pilot’s extension, approved on December 13, 2018; Charge Ready Schools and Charge Ready State Parks & Beaches, approved on November 13, 2019; and Charge Ready 2, approved on August 27, 2020.
3 In 2021, Charge Ready Pilot and Bridge were fully committed, and new light-duty vehicle programs were in an early launch phase.
4 SCE’s transportation fleet electrification goals align with Pathway 2045 and are based on the proportion of plug-in electric vehicles, including plug-in hybrids, within SCE’s transportation fleet. Vehicles with plug-in, battery- powered, anti-idle job site work systems, such as electric power take-off units, are also counted as part of the heavy-duty goal. Forklifts exclude rough terrain forklifts and telehandlers.
5 Vehicle weight classifications are as follows: Light-Duty Vehicles (DOT Class 1, ≤ 6k GVW), Medium-Duty Vehicles (DOT Classes 2 and 3, > 6k to ≤ 14k GVW) and Heavy-Duty Vehicle Class (DOT Classes 4-8, > 14k GVW) 6 Goals contingent on original equipment manufacturer vehicle availability and funding approval through the CPUC.
GOAL: By 2025, obtain SCE customer commitments to deploy (or commit to deploy for utility-owned installations) at least 41,000 EV charge ports to serve at least 2,200 sites through SCE’s Charge Ready light-duty vehicle charging programs2. 
GOAL: By 2030, within SCE’s transportation fleet, electrify 100% of light-duty vehicles, 30% of medium-duty vehicles, 8% of heavy-duty vehicles and 60% of forklifts4,5,6.

GOAL: No worker (employee or contractor) fatalities3. 
Employee Fatalities 2018 0 achieved 2019 0 achieved 2020 0 achieved 2021 0 achieved 1 Edison International’s DEI goal is framed around the public commitment Edison International made to Paradigm for Parity in 2016. Paradigm for Parity is focused on gender parity in “Senior Operating Roles,” which Edison. 
International defines as Edison International, SCE and Edison Energy2 executives, i.e., officers and directors (Edison Energy executives include officers only), by 2030.
2 Edison Energy is not the same company as Southern California Edison, the utility, and Edison Energy is not regulated by the CPUC.
3 Edison International and SCE have foundational safety, compliance and system operations goals as part of their executive and nonexecutive annual incentive programs. These foundational goals include no employee fatalities or serious injuries to the public from system failure. Learn more by visiting Edison International’s 2022 Proxy Statement, pp. 48–50 4 One employee of an SCE contractor suffered fatal injuries in 2021, as a result of a vehicle-related incident. See Safety Performance for additional details about SCE’s response.
5 In 2017, SCE invested in an in-depth assessment of our safety culture because we care about the health and well-being of SCE employees, contractors and the public. We learned that many of our people think of our safety measures as something we do just for compliance. Using a maturity model, we are now tracking our evolution and conducting in-depth surveys every three years to determine our progress. Our goal is to evolve our culture by 2026 to one where employees choose to act safely for not only themselves, but for their peers. The company’s aspirational aim over the long term is to evolve our culture to one where employees take ownership of their own safety and the safety of those around them as a core part of their job and in support of the company’s collective mission.
6 The 2020 assessment indicated the company’s safety culture has progressed from being squarely in Phase 2 ("I have to") in 2017, to strong leading elements of Private Compliance (“I choose to for me”) with some lagging elements of Phase 2. While we aren’t fully anchored in Phase 3, the 2020 safety culture assessment demonstrates strong indicators of progress. See 2020 Sustainability Report for more details.

Edison International’s earnings are prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Management uses core earnings (losses) internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance. Core earnings (losses) are also used when communicating with investors and analysts regarding Edison International’s earnings results to facilitate comparisons of the company’s performance from period to period. Core earnings (losses) are a non-GAAP financial measure and may not be comparable to those of other companies. Core earnings (losses) are defined as earnings attributable to Edison International shareholders less non-core items. Non-core items include income or loss from discontinued operations and income or loss from significant discrete items that management does not consider representative of ongoing earnings, such as write downs, asset impairments and other income and expense related to changes in law, outcomes in tax, regulatory or legal proceedings and exit activities, including sale of certain assets and other activities that are no longer continuing.

Note: All metrics reflect data associated with Edison International and its consolidated subsidiaries, with the exception of metrics denoted by (*), which reflect Southern California Edison (SCE) data only, and the “Community Investments” metrics related to contributions to nonprofit organizations by employees and employee and retiree volunteer hours, which reflect Edison International and SCE data only.
1 See Non-GAAP Reconciliations and Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on p. 93 in the Appendix.
2 Metric modified to “thousands of customers” to align with other company reports.
3 In 2021, SCE updated its “retail sales” accounting to net out excess generation stemming from net-energy metering customers who generate power through rooftop solar and sell the excess back to the grid. This reduces SCE’s retail sales by approximately 3% and has the downstream effect of reducing, from an accounting perspective, the amount of “unspecified” energy SCE purchases on behalf of customers and those associated emissions. It also increases, from an accounting perspective, the proportion of specified resources, such as RPS-eligible energy, in SCE’s retail sales. This updated approach more accurately reflects the load served and power purchased on behalf of and sold to SCE customers. To reflect this new methodology, the “RPS Compliance (% Retail Sales)” metric has been updated for prior years as follows: in 2019, 38.1% to 39.0%; in 2020, 34.2% to 35.3%. The "Carbon-Free Power" metric has not been updated for prior years, however, and a year-over-year comparison is not feasible. "CO2e Emissions from Delivered Electricity Rate," and Scope 2 and 3 emissions may also be affected, given that emissions related to SCE’s purchased power comprise a portion of these metrics.
4 Certain 2021 data, as noted, is an estimate and includes as an input SCE’s estimated 2021 delivered power mix using the methodology prescribed by the California Energy Commission’s (CEC’s) Power Source Disclosure. 
Program (PSDP) as of April 2, 2022. SCE’s final PSDP report will be filed with the CEC on June 1, 2022, and may include updates to the inputs used in these calculations.
5 Certain GHG emissions figures from 2020 have been updated to reflect final purchased power data from SCE’s 2020 Power Source Disclosure Program filing, which was finalized and submitted after the preparation of the 2020 Sustainability Report, as well as use of other refined data inputs in the inventory. Updates include: "CO2e Emissions from Owned Electricity Rate" from 271 lbs/MWh to 273 lbs/MWh, "CO2e Emissions from Delivered Electricity Rate" from 512 lbs/MWh to 466 lbs/MWh, "Scope 1 Emissions" from 1.5 MMT CO2e to 1.4 MMT CO2e, "Scope 2 Emissions" from 0.7 MMT CO2e to 0.8 MMT CO2e, and "Scope 3 Emissions" from 11.3 MMT CO2e to 11.9 MMT CO2e. 2020 Scope 3 emissions calculation update also includes the addition of emissions from Edison International and SCE’s supply chain, as well as Edison Energy’s11 business travel and employee commuting (Edison International and SCE’s business travel and employee commuting were previously included). The 2020 figures for Scope 1 and 2 also now included Edison Energy's emissions.
6 Edison International’s GHG emissions inventory excludes certain miniscule sources, such as refrigerants related to air conditioning systems that are too small to be captured in SCE’s air quality compliance reporting or emissions from certain specialized vehicle rentals, which we estimate to be miniscule and permitted for exclusion pursuant to The Climate Registry’s GHG emissions reporting protocol.
7 Edison International’s Scope 3 emissions reporting continues to evolve. The 2019 value includes emissions from power purchases to serve SCE customers. The 2020 and 2021 value includes emissions from power purchases to serve SCE customers, Edison International and SCE's supply chain, and enterprisewide employee commuting and business travel. Other Scope 3 emissions categories may be relevant to Edison International that are not included here.
8 SF6 emissions calculated based on best available data. SF6 emissions from 2020 were updated from 0.15 MMT CO2e to 0.13 MMT CO2e to reflect updates made to regulatory filings. SCE uses SF6 alternative technologies such as vacuum and oil-filled equipment when practicable and seeks to phase out additional SF6 gas-insulated equipment classes as the alternative technology becomes available.
9 "NOx Emissions Rate of UOG" and "NOx Emissions from UOG" increased year-over-year between 2020 and 2021 due to two reasons: (1) a compliance finding at Pebbly Beach Generating Station (Catalina Island, California) required Unit 15 (cleanest engine) to shut down for one month. SCE operated other engines which have a higher NOx emission rate. (2) calibration issue with the continuous emissions monitoring system at Grapeland Peaker due to frequent start-ups and short run times affected the validity of certain readings. This required the use of a conservative emissions methodology to account for invalid readings, leading to higher-than-average emissions.
10 2021 data related to Customer Energy Efficiency metrics is an estimate based on best-available data at the time of report publication.
11 Edison Energy is not the same company as Southern California Edison, the utility, and Edison Energy is not regulated by the California Public Utilities Commission.

1 Representation as of December 31 of the reporting year. Employee-related metrics exclude interns and those on a leave of absence.
2 The 2021 Sustainability Report includes "Employee Engagement (% favorable)" and "Turnover Rate (%)" in the Sustainability Scorecard for the first time.
3 Employee engagement trends appear to be flat or on a slight decline. Although root causes are still under analysis, we continue to examine the impact of the pandemic on the responses of our employees. See Edison. 
International 2021 Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Report for more details.
4 Higher employee turnover aligns with the labor market conditions experienced by most companies in 2021. Even with the increase, our employee turnover remained lower than the average for the electric utility industry.
5 While Edison International’s enterprisewide performance related to serious injuries improved in 2021, our Days Away, Restrictions and Transfers (DART) rate and other safety metrics covering sprains, strains and related injuries worsened, reflecting a return to average rates following the lower rates experienced during the pandemic. SCE has expanded its plan to target injuries among field employees that result in the most DART categories by engaging local leaders to create actions based on safety data. See Safety for more details.
6 SCE was deeply saddened that a contractor worker incurred fatal injuries in 2021 as a result of a vehicle-related incident. To help eliminate Serious injury and fatality (SIF) and reduce overall injuries among our contractor workers, SCE met with contractors to review incidents, discuss root causes and align on corrective actions. See Safety for more details.
7 SCE’s 2021 performance fell slightly compared to 2020 across all three of its reliability metrics, due to mitigation measures taken to further enhance circuit protection and operations during high fire risk weather to minimize the probability of ignition.
8 In 2021, there was a decrease in the amount of hazardous waste soils and debris, and sulfuric acid, disposed due to decreased field project work.
9 The 2021 Sustainability Report removed the individual reporting of “Number of Air Permit Noncompliance Events with Fine” and “Number of Water Permit Noncompliance Events with Fine” in favor of a combined “Number of. 
Environmental-Related Noncompliance Events with Fine” metric, which captures not only air and water, but a broader set of noncompliance events. In 2021, noncompliance events related to air quality compliance deviations with fleet fueling requirements.
10 Consumptive water withdrawal data reflect best-available estimates that may require updates to reflect subsequent equipment calibration.

SCE is addressing current and evolving water management risks through our environmental management system and a published standard for water systems to ensure management of groundwater rights in accordance with California’s Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA). The SGMA provides the state with a framework to manage its groundwater resources, and, as basins in California are adjudicated, SCE determines our legal entitlement to authorize water rights for the applicable groundwater basins within SCE’s service area. Accordingly, SCE collects and submits pumping reporting records to the state and local groundwater management agencies. The applicable agencies include the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB), state Division of Drinking Water (DDW), state Department of Water Resources (DWR) and local watermasters established under the SGMA.

EDISON INTERNATIONAL COMPANY RESPONSE/LOCATION OF INFORMATION. 
STRATEGY. 
Disclose the actual and potential impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organization’s businesses, strategy, and financial planning where such information is material.
a) Describe the climate-related risks and opportunities the organization has identified over the short, medium, and long term. 
Edison International’s business strategy is focused on the clean energy transition and the company’s role in helping to meet broader, economywide climate change goals. The company’s strategy is aligned with societal trends around the rising importance of addressing climate change through the use of clean electricity, low carbon fuels and new technologies. In alignment with economywide actions planned by the State of California, Edison International is committed to achieving net-zero GHG emissions across Scopes 1, 2 and 3 by 2045.
Edison International’s principal subsidiary, SCE, is a regulated electric utility that conducts short (current year to four years forward), medium (five to 10 years forward) and long-range (>10 years forward) planning around its power portfolio, grid planning and other infrastructure investments through regulated proceedings at the CPUC. In terms of its power portfolio, SCE has a long-term objective to supply 100% carbon-free power in terms of retail sales to customers by 2045, a medium-term objective to deliver power with 80% carbon-free resources by 2030, and related short-term goals, including related compliance requirements overseen by the CPUC and California Energy Commission (CEC). SCE files an Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) every two to three years, as part of the IRP Proceeding at the CPUC, focused on ensuring long-term resource plans meet reliability needs and state-designated GHG emissions reduction requirements in the most affordable way. In addition to seeking to be granted approval to procure the clean resources needed to meet its decarbonization goals through the IRP and related CPUC proceedings, SCE conducts climate adaptation vulnerability assessments to identify additional system needs as climate change affects customer demand and clean resource production.
SCE is also focused on its role in helping the state achieve net-zero GHG emissions economywide by 2045 through an electric-led strategy. Through SCE’s vision to decarbonize large parts of the economy using clean and reliable power, SCE has identified significant opportunities to facilitate this transition through investments in electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure and proposed programs to support building electrification. SCE is investing more than $800 million to advance the adoption of EVs across its service area and recently proposed to invest $677 million in additional funding to accelerate the growth of the building electrification market. SCE also has goals to electrify its own fleet. In addition, SCE publishes white papers about the clean energy transition, including economywide actions needed to meet carbon neutrality, as well as the changes needed to SCE’s grid to deliver high levels of carbon-free resources.
On the physical risk side, SCE performs climate adaptation vulnerability assessments to identify acute and chronic risks. In May 2022, SCE submitted its first Climate Adaptation Vulnerability Assessment pursuant to CPUC direction, using a conservative (i.e., high emissions, absent global climate mitigation) RCP8.5 scenario and considering long-term impacts of temperature, precipitation, sea-level rise and wildfire hazards. This assessment evaluates mitigation needs in 10-, 30- and 50-year timeframes. In the near term, SCE is also focused on mitigating the risk of climate change-driven wildfires and files annual Wildfire Mitigation Plans (WMPs) with the Office of Energy Infrastructure Safety, detailing its progress.

EDISON INTERNATIONAL COMPANY RESPONSE/LOCATION OF INFORMATION. 
STRATEGY (CONTINUED) c) Describe the resilience of the organization’s strategy, taking into consideration different climate-related scenarios, including a 2°C or lower scenario. 
Edison International’s business strategy is aligned with the transition to a net-zero economy. Edison International’s principal subsidiary, SCE, delivers power to customers entirely within the state of California, which has some of the most aggressive climate change goals in the nation and, when taken together, are broadly considered to be consistent with a 1.5°C scenario.
In 2019, SCE released Pathway 2045, which examined the energy implications of California’s long-term decarbonization goals on both the economy as a whole and the electric sector and mapped out a feasible and low-cost path to meeting those goals. The paper concludes that aggressive electrification across the economy, coupled with clean electricity, is the most affordable path to achieve net-zero GHG emissions economywide. In terms of risks, moving to a decarbonized energy supply represents significant changes to electric system planning that has largely been based on reliance on dispatchable generation resources supplied by fossil fuels. As shown in Pathway 2045, SCE is exploring how to manage the changes to the grid that may present reliability risks with new technologies such as long duration energy storage and generation supplied from low- or zero-carbon fuels such as hydrogen.
In 2020, SCE released Reimagining the Grid, an assessment of the future electric grid needed to enable the efficient integration of these clean resources while ensuring climate adaptation and broader resilience. These analyses support SCE’s continued investment in electrification and clean energy-related technologies, including related to the grid.
In 2021, Edison International released Mind the Gap: Policies for California’s Countdown to 2030, highlighting the accelerated rate of annual GHG emissions reductions needed across the California economy to achieve the state’s 2030 climate goals. The report recommends state and federal policies and funding mechanisms to close the gap between the state’s current trajectory and the performance required.
On the physical risk side, SCE performs vulnerability assessments for climate adaptation. In May 2022, SCE submitted a climate change vulnerability assessment pursuant to CPUC direction, using a conservative (i.e., high emissions, absent global climate mitigation) RCP8.5 scenario and considering long-term impacts of temperature, precipitation, sea-level rise and wildfire hazards. Edison International subsequently published Adapting for Tomorrow: Powering a Resilient Future, summarizing key takeaways, including the types of vulnerabilities SCE, our customers and our communities could face. SCE’s vulnerability assessment and ongoing planning for future grid architectures envisioned in Reimagining the Grid will form the bases for grid investments that harden the decarbonized grid against current and future climate risks.

EDISON INTERNATIONAL COMPANY RESPONSE/LOCATION OF INFORMATION. 
RISK MANAGEMENT. 
Disclose how the organization identifies, assesses, and manages climate-related risks.
a) Describe the organization’s processes for identifying and assessing climaterelated risks. 
Edison International and SCE’s ERM process is designed to identify, anticipate and provide oversight of business risks, assess risk management options, and develop and select risk mitigation and response activities. This includes climate-related risks both directly and as a factor that compounds other business risks.
Climate-related risks are included within Edison International and SCE’s list of key enterprise risks, both as a standalone climate change risk, and as a cross-cutting risk factor that is evaluated for its impact on other enterprise risks. As a standalone risk, climate change is reviewed over the near term on a likelihood and consequence basis in comparison to other key enterprise risks at the company, and it is reviewed but not scored over a period extending to 2070.
SCE’s risk-informed decision-making process builds upon processes for risk-informed ratemaking required by the CPUC In 2022, SCE filed its Risk Assessment and Mitigation Plan (RAMP) report that considers SCE’s climate adaptation vulnerability assessment and corresponding community engagement.
At Edison International and SCE, several complementary processes are in place for identifying and addressing climate-related risks. ERM uses a standardized risk intake process to identify new potential risks from a wide variety of sources, including operations within the company; connections with corporate functions, including Strategy, Audits and Regulatory; and research, benchmarking and surveys performed both internally and externally.
Each department is responsible for providing data, analysis and guidance on their business’ risks to ERM, and ERM works in close coordination with SCE’s cross-departmental climate change team on assessing companywide climate change vulnerability and adaptation options.

RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED) b) Describe the organization’s processes for managing climate-related risk. 
As stated in response to Risk Management, Part A, SCE’s risk-informed decision-making process builds upon processes for risk-informed ratemaking required by the CPUC.
We follow a comprehensive protocol to assess and mitigate risks across our operations. The next step in the process after risk identification is risk prioritization. A common set of risk terms and tools are used to prioritize risks based on comparable attributes, including likelihood and consequence of potential risk events. ERM provides a riskinformed perspective to the development of company strategy, and the strategic risks of the company are accounted for in the enterprise risk register, including climate-related risks.
Detailed mitigation deployment plans are developed for enterprise risks, and risk review requirements are now incorporated into the charters of various Edison International and SCE management committees across the company.
Risk monitoring and verification activities as well as risk issues that occur during project and program execution of risk mitigation deployment plans are monitored by ERM and its oversight committees.
These committees include the SCE Risk Management Working Group, a senior leadership forum designed to integrate operations and risk and provide a common framework for decision-making; the SCE Finance and Risk Management Committee, which oversees and approves ERM; and the Edison International Managing Committee and SCE and Edison International Board of Directors and Board Committees discussed in the Governance section of this TCFD disclosure.
Standardized risk analysis summaries are now required to be included in support materials used in senior leadership decision forums. ERM is responsible for ensuring risks are considered in decisions about the company’s business strategy, financial planning, significant operational and regulatory decisions, and goal-setting.
Furthermore, ERM works with the internal audit department and various quality-control functions embedded in the business to provide risk insights into the development of the scope of assurance verifications performed by those groups. Senior ERM leadership, as well as departmental leadership, also provide support for assurance. The risk management process informs the annual audit plan.
Once selected, mitigation and response options are planned for deployment, and monitored during their life cycle for effectiveness. A detailed alternatives analysis discussing multiple approaches to treat top safety risks to Edison International (including climate change) is discussed within SCE’s 2022 RAMP filing.

METRICS AND TARGETS. 
Disclose the metrics and targets used to assess and manage relevant climate-related risks and opportunities where such information is material.
a) Disclose the metrics used by the organization to assess climate-related risks and opportunities in line with its strategy and risk management process. 
Edison International reports climate- and environmental-related metrics annually in our sustainability report related to topics identified by our ESG materiality assessment and based on industry benchmarking. The company also reports climate- and environmental-related metrics in accordance with third-party standards, including Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, Global Reporting Initiative and Edison Electric Institute ESG/Sustainability reporting template.
In addition, SCE reports climate- and environmental-related metrics through compliance filings with state and federal agencies.
b) Disclose Scope 1, Scope 2, and, if appropriate, Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and the related risks. 
Estimated 2021 GHG Emissions: Scope 1: 1.0 MMT CO2e Scope 2: 0.8 MMT CO2e Scope 3: 11.6 MMT CO2e. 
Notes: • Edison International’s GHG emissions inventory excludes certain miniscule sources, such as refrigerants related to air conditioning systems that are too small to be captured in SCE’s air quality compliance reporting or emissions from certain specialized vehicle rentals, which we estimate to be miniscule and permitted for exclusion pursuant to The Climate Registry’s GHG emissions reporting protocol.
• Edison International’s Scope 3 emissions reporting continues to evolve. In 2021 it included the following emissions sources: specified and unspecified power purchases to serve SCE customers (92%), an estimate of Edison International and SCE's supply chain (8%), and enterprisewide employee commuting and business travel (<1%). Other Scope 3 emissions categories may be relevant to Edison International that are not included here.
• Emissions are an estimate.
c) Describe the targets used by the organization to manage climate-related risks and opportunities and performance against targets. 
Edison International has set a net-zero commitment and long-term goals related to several of our topics identified in our ESG materiality assessment. The company tracks progress toward these goals annually in its sustainability report. In addition, Edison International and SCE establish annual performance incentives tied to priority topics, including those related to climate change; e.g., goals related to wildfire resilience, capital deployment and policy outcomes associated with SCE’s Pathway 2045, including promoting broader transportation and building electrification.

SCE is addressing current and evolving water management risks through our environmental management system and a published standard for water systems to ensure management of groundwater rights in accordance with California’s Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA). The SGMA provides the state a framework to manage its groundwater resources, and as basins in California are adjudicated, SCE determines our legal entitlement to authorize water rights for the applicable groundwater basins within SCE service area. Accordingly, SCE collects and submits pumping reporting records to the state and local groundwater management agencies. The applicable agencies include the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB), state Division of Drinking Water (DDW), state Department of Water Resources (DWR) and local watermasters established under the SGMA.

GRI 306: WASTE (CONTINUED) 103-3 Evaluation of the management approach. 
SCE has an environmental management system with standards, manuals and project-specific requirements for managing water runoff and discharges, spill management and waste management.
SCE has four types of potential discharges: we are governed by the State Water Board under a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit for discharges from utility vaults and underground structures; we manage a facility stormwater program with best management practices to prevent pollutants in stormwater runoff; we operate under the Construction General Permit for stormwater management for our construction projects; and we develop Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure plans to prevent or control the release of oil from our facilities in the event of a spill. In order to monitor the effectiveness of our programs, monthly inspections and annual field assessments are conducted. In addition, SCE benchmarks with other companies covered under the utility vault discharges permit.
From our day-to-day operations and project work, SCE generates nonhazardous, hazardous, electronic and universal waste. SCE manages waste for reuse, recycle or disposal in accordance with all federal, state and local laws and regulations, as determined by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, California Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Toxic Substances Control. SCE maintains an asset recovery program that strives to ensure materials are repurposed, if possible, or managed to recover recyclable materials. Specific electronic items, such as computers, are offered to third-party vendors to be repurposed, when possible, or managed for recycle.
SCE utilizes formal internal program assessments and audits to evaluate the hazardous waste program. The assessments include a review of written documents, including standards, manuals and required records, in conjunction with facility visits, to evaluate the implementation of the programs in the field.

GRI 407: FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION AND COLLECTIVE BARGAINING (CONTINUED) 103-3 Evaluation of the management approach. 
Collective bargaining normally occurs prior to the expiration of current Collective Bargaining Agreements (CBAs), and negotiations include the broad primary topics of wages, hours, working conditions and benefits. Negotiations are between the union’s bargaining team (representing the covered employees) and the company’s bargaining team (representing the company). Responsibility for the negotiation strategy and process lies with SCE labor relations, leadership of specific SCE operational units covered by the CBA and SCE senior leadership. We adhere to the mandated guidelines by the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) as governed by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). Additionally, we abide by the governing act, NLRA as governed by the NLRB, in regard to employees and organizing, a component of which is stated here: “Employees shall have the right to self-organization, to form, join or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in other concerted activities, and shall also have the right to refrain from any or all such activities.” We do not have policies prohibiting such.
