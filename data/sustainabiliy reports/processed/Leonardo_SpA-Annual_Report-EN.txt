Since 2020 Leonardo (hereinafter also referred to as the Group, the Enterprise or the Company) has adopted an integrated approach to reporting financial performance and environmental, social and governance (ESG) information, with the aim of offering in a single document a complete, measurable and transparent view of the value generated by the company. The Integrated Annual Report describes in fact the development strategies of Leonardo, driven by the vision for the next decade expressed in the “Be Tomorrow – Leonardo 2030” Strategic Plan, and the performance achieved, the way in which the company creates innovative solutions with its supply chain partners and the scientific research ecosystem, operating responsibly in the countries where it is present, and enhancing the value of all its capital, people and expertise, technology and intellectual property, financial resources, industrial assets, relations and partnerships, energy and natural resources. The Integrated Annual Report is composed of: > the Report on Operations, which includes the Consolidated Non-Financial Statement (NFS) pursuant to Legislative Decree 254/2016, prepared in accordance with the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), including the correlation table and the methodology note of the NFS; > the Consolidated Financial Statements; > the Separate Financial Statements of Leonardo SpA. In preparing the Integrated Annual Report, the following have been taken into account: the priorities reported by ESMA (European Securities and Markets Authority) for financial statements prepared according to the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and for non-financial disclosures, the Framework of the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC), the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the Ten Principles of the UN Global Compact, the standards of the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) for the Aerospace & Defence sector, the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and the core metrics laid down in the White Paper on “Measuring Stakeholder Capitalism - Towards Common Metrics and Consistent Reporting of Sustainable Value Creation” of the World Economic Forum (WEF), structured into four pillars: • Governance: corporate governance, responsible business conduct, risk management and stakeholder engagement. • People: protection of labour, welfare and inclusion, the enhancement of people and skills, health and safety and respect for human rights. • Planet: sustainable management of natural resources and the decarbonisation of industrial processes and technological solutions, limiting the environmental impact and adopting circular models. • Prosperity: technology innovation, supply chain value, relations with customers, territories and communities, and technological solutions to contribute to economic and social progress.

LETTER TO STAKEHOLDERS 


 
9. 
Integrated Annual report 2021 2021 was an important year: we resumed the path to growth which we had already embarked on and recorded results higher than those finally achieved before the pandemic in all business sectors, except for Aerostructures, which were still hit by the impact of COVID-19 on the civil Aeronautics market. In the scenario of continuing uncertainty that marked the year just ended, Leonardo demonstrated its resilience and the strength of its commercial, industrial, economic and financial fundamentals, laying the foundations for the resumption of the path to growth and sustainable development. Once again, Leonardo fulfilled the commitments it had undertaken and met and exceeded the targets it had set itself. We achieved a level of orders above pre-pandemic levels and increased revenues; we achieved excellent operating results and improved profitability, meeting and exceeding the targets we had set ourselves, with cash generation more than double the initial expectations. At present our Group is stronger in terms of structure, supported by the Defence and Government business and further strengthened by the acquisition of 25.1% of Hensoldt, reflecting the long-term vision on the importance of building cooperation in the European Aerospace and Defence industry and Leonardo's determination to play an active role in its development. A concrete plan has been implemented to recover and relaunch the Aerostructures business, which has been heavily hit by the impact of the pandemic, and the first signs of improvement can already be seen. Despite a widespread crisis in the civil aeronautics sector, Leonardo gained orders of over €bil. 14.3 in 2021 (+4.0% compared to 2020), thus increasing its portfolio to over €bil. 35.5. In particular, a substantial order volume in Helicopters, €mil. 4,370, which sees a partial recovery in the civil aviation segment, was accompanied by the excellent performance of Defence Electronics & Security, €mil. 7,579, in particular of the European component (+14.5% compared to 2020), as well as of Aeronautics, €mil. 2,945, with Aircraft recording growth of over 30%, more than offsetting the decline expected in civil Aeronautics. Despite the effects of the pandemic, revenues of more than €bil. 14.1 were achieved in 2021, recording an increase of 2.45% compared to the pre-pandemic result of 2019 (+5.4% compared to 2020), thanks to the efforts undertaken and the strength of the Group's fundamentals. All of Leonardo's businesses marked substantial growth and, in particular, Helicopters, which recorded total revenues of €bil. 4.2, with an increase of 4.7% compared to 2020, Defence Electronics & Security, which stood at €bil. 7 (+6.4% compared to 2020) and Aircraft, which closed with €bil. 3.3 (+24% compared to 2020), more than offsetting the decline expected in the civil component. EBITA also showed sharp growth, at €bil. 1.1 (+19.7% compared to 2020), with a RoS of 7.9%, despite the downturn in Aerostructures, which were heavily hit by the continuing air traffic crisis resulting from the pandemic. It is worth noting that an excellent performance was recorded by Defence Electronics & Security, which reported an increase of over 30% compared to the previous year and 14.7% compared to 2019, reaching €mil. 703, with a RoS of 10.1%. The Aircraft performance also grew by more than 21% (+35% compared to 2019), with EBITA of €mil. 432 (RoS 13.2%), and the Helicopters division grew by 6% compared to the previous year, with EBITA of €mil. 406 and RoS of 9.8%. The Space business segment tripled the results of the previous year, recording EBITA of €mil. 62. Despite the costs incurred to ensure the health protection of all personnel, and the costs related to the start of operations for the announced recovery of the civil aeronautics sector pursuant to art. 4 of the "Fornero Act", Leonardo recorded an Operating Result (EBIT) of €mil. 911 with an increase of over 76% compared to the previous year. From a financial perspective, FOCF 2021 was €mil. 209, more than twice the target set, and the overall debt level was reduced down to €mil. 3,122. The reduction in debt then led to a substantial reduction in the cost of debt, which fell from 5.4% in 2016 to the minimum level of 2.3% in 2021.

Integrated Annual report 2021. 
We have again proposed the payment of dividends (€ 0.14 per share) in consideration of our performance and confidence in the path to growth we have embarked upon. Such great results make us increasingly aware of how sustainable our growth must also be. We feel the responsibility to play a key role – together with institutions and governments - in providing security and protection of citizens and territories. This is why we continue to selectively invest 12.8% of our revenues in Research & Development: we invest in complex projects that create value in the long term and drive technological progress. In being aware of representing a driver of development, security and progress, we continue to pursue our strategic programme outlined in the “Be Tomorrow - Leonardo 2030” plan. We have embarked on a path to sustainable growth in the long term that focuses on innovation and technological development, which are enabling factors and decisive elements that allow us to face the challenges of the present and the future and to seize opportunities in a constantly changing scenario. Looking at Italy, for example, we can only be proud to support the relaunch of the national economic and production system, making our skills and expertise available to the Italian institutions. Think, for example, of the digitisation of the Public Administration, as well as to road infrastructure modernisation and environmental monitoring. Our commitment to sustainable development has enabled us to achieve important milestones in 2021 too. On the decarbonisation front, we have reduced CO2 emissions by 23% compared to 2020, mainly due to the replacement of SF6 gas in the Helicopter sector. This is an important step that brings us closer to the goal we have set ourselves: reducing emissions by 40% by 2030. Important results have also been achieved in terms of diversity and inclusion: the percentage of women hired with a STEM degree has increased, amounting to 19% of total hires with a STEM degree in 2021, as well as the proportion of young people under 30. Work also continued on our commitment to sustainable finance. In order to increasingly bring our financing strategy into line with sustainability objectives, we have in fact entered into the first ESG-linked Revolving Credit Facility and the first ESG Term Loan, making 50% of the total sources of financing linked to ESG parameters, including the reduction of CO2 emissions through eco-efficiency of industrial processes and the promotion of female employment with STEM degrees, which are the same as the Long Term Incentive Plan. On the other hand, we are committed to keeping 50% of the Group's investments in line with the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), contributing in particular to innovation and digital transformation, creating skilled jobs and developing solutions for the security of people, infrastructure and territories. The results we have achieved on ESG topics have also been recognised worldwide, following the Group's presence in several major sustainability ratings, indices and rankings. Among these, we must mention the achievement of the highest score in the Aerospace and Defence sector in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index of S&P Global for the third year running, the inclusion in the MIB ESG Index launched by Borsa Italiana in 2021, the confirmation in the A list of CDP Climate Change and in the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index. These are results that make us proud of the path we have taken so far and that drive us to an ever greater commitment to meet and exceed the targets we have set ourselves. None of this would have been possible without the fundamental contribution given by the men and women of Leonardo, who have once again demonstrated great strength, adaptability and team spirit in working in a constantly evolving context. Let’s extend to them our most heartfelt thanks. Chairman Chief Executive Officer Luciano Carta………………………………………………………………………. Alessandro Profumo

The markets in which Leonardo operates, both nationally and internationally, are characterised by highly complex ongoing transformation processes and an ever-increasing level of competition, which is exacerbated by the entry of new players coming from countries that did not traditionally have an AD&S industry, but which are now growing, even in the new technology segments, beginning to cover domestic demand and sometimes even entering the international market: among these we can mention South Korea, Turkey, Iran and Brazil.
In addition, there are players from adjacent civil and commercial sectors with established expertise in innovative technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Quantum Computing, which are capable of affecting the traditional power relations and dynamics of the AD&S industry with effects on competitive pressure and, consequently, on prices and margins. The continuation of the health and economic crisis linked to the Covid-19 pandemic, in the uncertainty of an international framework that is still evolving, has confirmed the profound change in the pre-existing balances, which started in 2020, leading to an epochal paradigm shift at a technological, cultural, social and economic level, the effects of which will still continue for a long time.
In this scenario, Leonardo pursues its objectives concerning the improvement in the competitive positioning on international markets, and the creation of long-term value through responsible business conduct, the ongoing monitoring and an effective management of risks and opportunities, the protection of business continuity, and listening to and collaborating with stakeholders.
The processes and technological solutions developed by the Group are marked by a sustainable and inclusive development, in support of double transition, both digital and ecological, with the aim of safeguarding citizens, companies, institutions, territories and strategic infrastructures, which are increasingly exposed to the fragility of systems.

Reducing strategic dependencies - The concept of technological sovereignty evolved in 2021 based on a better understanding of the effects generated by disruptions of the global supply chains (lockdowns of manufacturing facilities, cascading effects of demand shock, disruption of logistics chains, shortage of raw materials). Technologies continued to be the drivers of institutional, business and individual resilience.
> A lack of understanding of the value chain is one of the causes of semiconductor shortages, for example in the automotive market, where lower demand for high-volume (about 3,000 chips per vehicle), low-value-added automotive components has resulted in manufacturers losing priority to the growing demand for chips for higher value-added solutions (smartphones and computers)15.
> US West Coast ports are experiencing congestion since September 2021 due to increased shipments (3 times compared to the first part of the year, 10 times > Supply chain value > Business continuity

MATERIALITY ANALYSIS. 
Vision, competitive positioning, sector scenario, role in society: Leonardo’s strategy responds dynamically to the topics that are priorities for the Group and its stakeholders. In line with the operating sustainability model implemented by the Group, the materiality analysis (or priority analysis) is a process aimed at identifying and assessing the strategic priorities reported by Leonardo and its stakeholders. It identifies the key topics that can influence the organization's ability to create value and protect it in the short, medium and long term. The result of the analysis is represented in a matrix that compares and summarises the opinions of Leonardo’s top management and stakeholders. The analysis - based on an approach that integrates a data-driven methodology with an extensive consultation of stakeholders and top management – guides the definition of the corporate strategy and the Sustainability Plan, as well as the assessment of risks and opportunities associated with each topic.
Materiality matrix 

1,877 national and international regulations analysed 
21 companies in the sector used in the benchmark analysis 
10,829 press articles and more than 450 million tweets analysed 
134 stakeholders from 13 countries have responded to the online survey. 
The methodology adopted for the 2021 materiality analysis is in line with that of the previous year, thus allowing for comparability between the results that emerged from data-driven analysis and consultation, in accordance with GRI Standards. The 16 priority topics were identified through an analysis of regulations, best practices and industry and public priorities in the economic and financial, environmental, social and corporate governance areas. The consultation, through an online survey, involved 33 company functions, 41 managers of Leonardo and a significant representation of external stakeholders. The data-driven analysis made it possible to make stakeholder priorities more understandable, leveraging the analysis of large document databases and semantic analysis (natural language processing) to give a score to the issues and prepare a ranking on a relative basis. Among the new features of the 2021 update, an inquiry into medium/long-term sustainability trends was also included in the survey on material topics to direct dialogue with stakeholders in the near future. The results of the materiality analysis will guide and support the Group’s strategy, driving actions towards those issues that emerged as relevant to our stakeholders (i.e. Climate Change), with the objective of increasing the Group’s value creation20.

SUSTAINABILITY PLAN. 
The necessary prerequisite for lasting progress to the benefit of people, the Planet and prosperity is for Leonardo to take a long-term vision, while considering the impact of its activities across the entire value chain, in accordance with the Sustainable Development Goals of the UN 2030 Agenda (SDGs) and the guidelines of the European Green Deal. Leonardo’s Sustainability Plan, in line with the guidelines of the Be Tomorrow - Leonardo 2030 Strategic Plan, translates this vision into actions, projects and practices, measurable in the short and long term, oriented towards the achievement of the SDGs in order to generate shared value for all the company's stakeholders. Technology innovation and digitisation are the cross-sector drivers of the Plan, which are key to facing sustainability challenges at global level, to accelerate a sustainable and inclusive transition: from decarbonisation to circular economy, passing through responsible business conduct, the development of a sustainable supply chain, solutions for emergency management, mobility and safety of people and the Planet, up to the promotion of scientific citizenship and social commitment to enhancing diversity and inclusion. The Sustainability Plan sets out eight thematic areas of action - clusters -, which cover the entire value chain: from research and innovation to operations and the development of new solutions, new business models and social impact, involving, on a cross-sector basis, Divisions, Group Companies and corporate central functions. In accordance with the provisions of the operating sustainability model and related procedures and policies, the Plan is subject to a process of periodic review and updating and monitored through specific Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), according to a structured data-driven approach that uses data management to analyse performance and effectively guide the decision-making process at all company levels. Other elements of evaluation of the initiatives are the perimeter of impact (e.g. Divisional initiatives and Cross-Divisional initiatives), and the connection with the activities and challenges of the reference territories, with the main objective of strengthening the business and the ability to create shared value. Within the Plan there are both projects that look at short/medium-term benefits, in line with public sustainability objectives, and "transformative" initiatives that look at future trends and needs and that will have a medium/long-term impact through important innovative and technological challenges. Under the Sustainability Plan, Leonardo intends to take action and focus its efforts on generating a significant impact on six core SDGs: development of competencies (SDG 4), creation of decent work and growth of partners (SDG 8), support to innovation and digital transformation (SDG 9), development of solutions for the security of people, infrastructures and territories (SDG 11) and climate action (SDG 13), adding sustainable production models (SDG 12) to its business activity. The Plan also has significant impact on additional SDGs: the reduction of food waste (SDG 2), the development of solutions to combat health emergencies (SDG 3), the promotion of a culture that fosters gender equality (SDG 5), energy efficiency and the higher use of renewable sources (SDG 7), the mitigation of environmental impact on the seas and in support of biodiversity (SDGs 14, 15), the continuous strengthening of the responsible business model and the protection of human rights (SDG 16) to the benefit of the Company and the supply chain.

Sustainability Plan – Integration into Leonardo value chain. 
The environmental, social, prosperity and governance Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) set out by Leonardo are the essential prerequisite to assessing the results that are achieved and to address the subsequent strategic planning. To this end, the Sustainability Plan is accompanied by a process of periodic updating of the initiatives, conducted in collaboration with the Sustainability Coordinators, who are specifically appointed at the level of Division, Group Companies and central functions of the Company. The Plan reinforces the achievement of the public sustainability targets that the Group has committed to reach and that are key to strengthening the strategy, increasing the competitiveness of Leonardo and of the industrial ecosystem of which the Company is the driving force, with the direct involvement of the supply chain. Furthermore, the Remuneration Policy is linked to achieving sustainability objectives, confirming that strategic vision, company performance and Top Management commitment are in line with each other. In particular, the long-term remuneration of the Chief Executive Officer and management is linked to attaining targets for the reduction of CO2 emissions of Scope 1 and 2 location-based, calculated as intensity on revenues, and increasing the recruitment of women with STEM degrees.

2022 GUIDANCE. 
The expected 2022 performance reaffirms the resumption of the sustainable growth path accompanied by increasing profitability. The civil business will continue to be heavily affected by the effects of the pandemic, despite the gradual recovery.
Based on the current assessment of the effects deriving from the geopolitical and global health situation on the supply chain and the global economy and assuming no additional major deterioration, Leonardo expects to deliver: • New Orders (approx. € 15 billion), confirming a strong positioning of the Group's products and solutions and the ability to effectively be present and penetrate in key markets; • Revenues of € 14.5-15 billion, up compared to 2021 thanks to the contribution of new orders and the delivery of portfolio activities on defence/governmental programmes; • increasing profitability, with EBITA (*) of € 1,180-1,220 million, driven by the growth in volumes and continued solid industrial profitability of the main business areas, despite the mix effect of programmes still under development and growing shares of prime contractor revenues; the estimate reflects also continued pressure in the civil sector, mainly Aerostructures and GIE-ATR; • FOCF of approx. € 500 million, with the defence/governmental business that guarantees solid cash generation while the cash absorption by the Aerostructures continues, despite being slightly lower than 2021; • Group Net Debt of approx. € 3.1 billion, includes the acquisition of 25.1% stake in Hensoldt, the assumptions of some business disposals and the expected payment of dividends. 
The estimates for the year 2022 are summarized below.

Report on operations at 31 December 2021 2021 PERFORMANCE AND FINANCIAL RESULTS. 
During the 2021 financial year Leonardo continued and strengthened the path to growing its business and increasing profitability as envisaged in the financial statements at 31 December 2020, showing a gradual and continuous improvement in the Group's industrial performance.
Despite the continuation of the effects of the pandemic and of the consequent government rules restricting movements in 2021 too, Leonardo confirmed resilience with a growing commercial, industrial and financial performance, even compared to the pre-pandemic period, thanks to the strength and diversification of its portfolio of products and solutions and its widespread presence all over the world, excluding the civil aviation component of the Aeronautics sector, which was still affected by the continuation of the abovementioned effects.
The volume of new orders continued to stand at excellent levels, thus confirming the good competitive positioning of the Group's products and solutions, with Revenues rising in all the main Business areas and profitability increasing in all the Sectors, with the exception of the civil aviation component, which continued to be affected by low volumes of demand from the main market operators. Cash flow recorded a significant improvement, reaching double the amount forecast at the beginning of the year, with a consequent benefit in terms of lower Group Net Debt compared to expectations.
Key performance indicator (KPI) The KPIs for the period and the main changes in the Group's performance are shown below. Insights into the Business sectors performance are dealt with in the specific section dedicated to the trend in each of them.

Please refer to the section entitled “Non-GAAP performance indicators” for definitions. The Group data do not include the contribution given by the Joint Ventures (JVs) invested in by the Group (which mainly include GIEATR in the Aeronautics sector, MBDA in the Defence Electronics & Security sector and JVs in the Space sector). The Group’s business conducted through the JVs and their strategic and financial importance remain unchanged, while for reporting purposes the JV’s contribution is only recognised at the level of profitability ratios (EBITA, EBIT and Net Result) as a result of the valuation at equity and, from a financial point of view, limited to the dividends collected. In 2021 the main Group’s JVs recorded total revenues of €bil. 2.5 (€bil. 2.1 in 2020) as concerns Leonardo’s share: as a result, the Group’s aggregate pro-forma revenues come to about €bil. 16.6 (€bil. 15.5 in 2020).

Report on operations at 31 December 2021. 
Commercial and business performance The following graphs show the performance of the Group’s ratios in the last 4 years; they highlight the continued growth achieved by the Group, with results above pre-pandemic levels, net of the Covid-19 impact on the civil aviation segment. It should be noted that the figure of New orders in 2018 was particularly high thanks to the acquisition by the Helicopters Division in that same year of the NH 90 Qatar contract worth €bil. 3. In light of the aforementioned considerations, below is also provided the Pro-forma EBITA figure, excluding the Aerostructures component: 
New Orders came to €bil. 14.3, confirming the growth trend recorded throughout 2021. The commercial performance of the Aeronautics Sector was excellent (+15%), with the Aircraft component that more than offset the expected downturn in the civil aviation business component. There was also growth in the Defense Electronics & Security sector, which benefitted from a significant positive performance by the European component of the sector, as will be seen below. Helicopters recorded new orders that remained substantially in line with the previous year, due to having gained the IMOS (Integrated Merlin Operational Support) order during the comparative period. The order backlog ensures a coverage in terms of equivalent production equal to about 2.5 years. The bookto-bill ratio (the ratio of New Orders for the period to Revenues) was equal to 1. The value of New Orders showed an increase of 4% compared with 2020 and of 1.4% compared with 2019. As regards Revenues (€bil. 14.1), the growth trend observed since the beginning of 2021 continued throughout the year, driven by the performance of the European component of Defense Electronics & Security, the Aircraft component of Aeronautics and - to a lesser extent - Helicopters. The aforesaid growth trend was only partly mitigated by the expected reduction in Aerostructures, which continued to be affected by the fall in production rates on the B787 and ATR programmes. Revenues showed an increase of 5.4% compared with 2020 and of 2.5% compared with 2019. EBITA, equal to €mil. 1,123 (ROS of 7.9%), recorded a significant growth as a whole (20%), with a substantial increase in all business sectors, as a result of higher revenues and improved profitability, to which must also be added a higher contribution on the part of all the strategic Joint Ventures, with particular regard to the Space Alliance manufacturing sector and to the GIE ATR, due to a gradual resumption of deliveries. The pro-forma EBITA value of the Aerostructures component showed a sharp increase over 2020 (29.5%) and compared with 2019 (5.1%). EBIT, equal to €mil. 911, showed a very sharp increase of more than 76% compared to 2020 (€mil. 517), despite the Group continued to incur costs, for amounts substantially in line with the previous year, in complying with the Government’s guidelines on health protection and the prevention of the spread of Covid19. Furthermore, EBIT was affected by the impact of restructuring costs sustained under the agreements governing the early retirement of the Aerostructures division's workforce on a voluntary basis (approximately €mil. 70), as part of the broader reorganisation plan involving the Division, as well as of non-recurring costs 15,124 14,105 13,754 14,307 36,118 36,513 35,516 35,534.

Report on operations at 31 December 2021 associated with the settlement of the Indian case, following which Leonardo may gain a new commercial positioning in the area. The Net result before extraordinary transactions (equal to €mil. 587), equal to the Net Result, recorded an increase of more than 140%, benefitting from the EBIT performance, as well as from a lower impact of financial costs; during the comparative period, the latter were heavily affected by the component linked to hedging the exposure to exchange risk and by the costs associated with the outstanding bond issues, which decreased during the period under consideration following a reduction in the bond exposure itself. The Net Result was also affected by the tax benefits arising from joining the tax concession schemes provided for in article 110 of Legislative Decree 104/2020 governing the realignment of tax values of goodwill.

As detailed in the section on “Financial transactions”, to which reference should be made, “Bonds” showed a reduction as a result of the subsequent repayment of the remaining amount of €mil. 739 of a bond issue, which had been launched in 2013 for an initial amount of €mil. 950 and which reached its natural expiry in January 2021; the increase in “Bank debt” was due to the use of the loan of €mil. 200 taken out with the European Investment Bank (EIB) in December 2020 and the use of a new Term Loan of €mil. 600 signed in December 2021. As at 31 December 2021 Leonardo had credit facilities available for a total of about €mil. 3,210 to meet the financing needs of the Group’s recurring operations, broken down as follows: an ESG-linked Revolving Credit Facility totalling €mil. 2,400, divided into two tranches, and additional unconfirmed short-term lines of credit of about €mil. 810, both of which were entirely unused as at the reporting date. Furthermore, the subsidiary Leonardo US Holding has revocable lines of credit available for its short-term requirements, which are guaranteed by Leonardo Spa, for a total counter-value of about €mil. 221, and which were entirely unused at 31 December 2021. Finally, Leonardo has unconfirmed lines of credit for guarantees for a total of €mil. 10,324, an amount of €mil. 3,750 of which was available at 31 December 2021.

The reported indicators are part of the Consolidated Non-financial Statement In 2021, the workforce showed a slight increase compared to 2020, mainly due to workers employed on permanent contracts in Italy.
Recruitment of employees under 30 years of age further increased compared to 2020 and continued to stand at around 40% of total hires, contributing to the steady increase in employees under 30 on total employees, from 8.2% in 2017 to 10.4% in 2021.
The enhancement of the gender diversity strategy had a positive impact on both the presence of female managers, which achieved 18% of the total number of executives and middle managers, and the new female hires with STEM degrees on total hires of workers with STEM degrees, increasing by more than 3 percentage points compared to 2020.
The injury rate showed a deterioration compared to 2020, a year significantly impacted by the pandemic, when the rate was improved compared to the previous years on account also of the lower presence of employees in the offices because of the smart working. The rate did definitely improve, however, compared to 2019 when it stood at 4.41. The company's commitment continues to extend the sites that are ISO 45001 certified with a health and safety management system where 78% of employees work (56% in 2017). The marked increase in the volume of training hours was attributable to the conversion of work vacancies into training activities for employees of the Aerostructures Division21. Total R&D costs accounted for 12.8% of revenues, allowing the Group to invest in internal developments and external collaborations, including with customers, with the objective of fuelling the product portfolio and improving competitiveness.
 21 There was a more than 10-fold increase in training hours delivered in the Aerostructures Division during 2021.


 
44. 
Report on operations at 31 December 2021. 
The considerable reduction in CO2 emissions (Scope 1 and Scope 2), in absolute and relative terms, is mainly related to the partial replacement of SF6 gas used as an inert substance within the helicopter production in a specific manufacturing process.
The intensity of water withdrawals showed a decrease compared to the pre-pandemic levels (-2% over 2019). The increase compared to the previous year was due to higher production volumes and increased physical presence of employee at sites.
The other environmental and energy efficiency indicators continued to show an improvement trend, confirming the company's commitment to reducing impacts and associated costs, a commitment that is also reflected in the goals set out in the Group’s sustainability plan.
In 2021, on a voluntary basis, Leonardo required to the Independent Legal Auditors to perform the full assurance (“Reasonable assurance engagement”) on a set of non-financial performance indicators (ESG) that are considered important and strategic for the Group22. Financial planning and investment management. 
Leonardo's investments have a direct and indirect impact on various industrial sectors and areas of society, anticipate and satisfy the needs of customers, citizens and territories and contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Financial planning and investment choices are aimed at supporting the Group's Industrial Plan and the vision expressed in the Be Tomorrow – Leonardo 2030 plan, while taking account of the identified risks and opportunities, the ongoing monitoring of market trends and binding and non-binding regulations, as well as stakeholder expectations.

Report on operations at 31 December 2021 1. HELICOPTERS. 
Leonardo is a leading group in the Helicopter sector at global level, delivering excellence in products worldwide. In the defence sector, Leonardo has recognised expertise in combat, naval, Search and Rescue (SAR) and Law Enforcement applications, while its leadership remains on a sound footing in various applications such as utility (aerial work, etc.), transport and Emergency Medical Service (EMS) missions in the civil market. On this last front Leonardo relies on its well-established expertise gained over the years, in particular thanks to the AW109 models in the past and, more recently, AW139 and AW169. Leonardo's EMS helicopters have also contributed to coping with the pandemic by transporting medical materials, equipment and patients. The performance in 2021 confirmed the growth trend in Revenues and EBITA, although on a scene that was still marked by the pandemic in the civil and commercial aviation business segments, which showed signs of recovery in terms of acquisitions. 128 new helicopters were delivered in 2021 (111 in 2020).
Below is the performance of the sector during the last 4 years:
As previously pointed out figure of New orders in 2018 was particularly high thanks to the acquisition by the Helicopters Division of the NH 90 Qatar contract for €bil. 3 New orders. They remained substantially in line, with the increase in new orders gained in the civil and commercial aviation sector offsetting a lower contribution given by those gained from government authorities, which was particularly significant during the comparative period. Among the main acquisitions for the period we must note: • the second and third orders under the TH-73A (AW119) programme for the US Navy for a total of 72 helicopters; • the second additional agreement for the completion of development activities and the supply of 4 series helicopters under the NEES (New Exploration and Escort Helicopter - Nuovo Elicottero da Esplorazione e Scorta) programme for the Italian Army; • the contracts concerning the supply of 9 AW139 helicopters for the Saudi Royal Court in Saudi Arabia and of 16 AW139 helicopters for The Helicopter Company, a company established by the Public Investment Fund (PIF) as the first and only operator authorised for commercial flights in the Kingdom; • contracts relating to the supply of 8 AW139 helicopters to the Finance Police in Italy; • the contract signed within the scope of the Government-to-Government (G2G) agreement between Italy and Austria, for the supply of 18 AW169M LUHs (Light Utility Helicopters) intended for the Austrian Ministry of Defence; • additional orders relating to the AW169 LUH programme for the Italian Carabinieri Corps and Army for a total of 17 helicopters; • the contract relating to the 5-year extension of the WIST (Wildcat Integrated Support and Training) programme for the provision of logistic support and training services for the fleet of AW159 Wildcat helicopters to the UK Ministry of Defence.

Report on operations at 31 December 2021. 
Revenues. They were on the rise due to increased work on orders gained from government authorities, in particular under the NH90 and TH-73A programmes for Qatar and the US Navy, as well as on the AW189/AW149 lines, which offset a slight decline in revenues expected in the civil and commercial aviation business segment, and specifically on the AW139 line. EBITA. The increase was commensurate with higher revenue volumes, while profitability remained substantially in line with 2020. Total market of the sector and 2022 Outlook. 
Market (*) 2021-2030. 
CAGR 2021-2030 Impact on the businesses in which Leonardo operates €bil. 26 +6.1%
Civil sector: Growth in the EMS (Emergency Medical Services), SAR (Search and Rescue) and Law Enforcement applications, including due to the Covid-19 emergency. There was a significant decline in the Oil & Gas segment, which was only partially offset by platforms supporting alternative energy sources. The effects of the pandemic have also hardly hit the passenger transport segment, with negative forecasts in particular for the first five years, whilst a recovery can be expected due to the recovery in passenger transport and the renewal of the related fleets for the second five year-period.
€bil. 116 -3.0%
Defense sector: The market is estimated to grow in the short term, due to the ageing of many fleets, with a replacement process that is already underway in the main countries (e.g. United States, United Kingdom, France), but which will slow down at the end of the period under consideration, with a tendency to carry out only the necessary upgrades of the platforms in operation, while waiting for the availability of the new generation of medium multi-role machines, based on new technologies.
(*) deliveries of new helicopters only. 
In 2022, revenue volumes are expected to grow, driven by the development of backlog activities on military/governmental programmes and a good flow of new orders. Profitability remained at good levels, also thanks to the initiatives to optimise industrial processes and improve the competitiveness of the main products, even though it was affected by a production mix characterised by growing activities on contracts acquired as prime contractor. Research, development and product engineering Research into the field of helicopters is increasingly oriented towards sustainability, in line with the European Green Deal plan, which sets out a roadmap for environmental objectives for 2050. In taking part in European programs such as Clean Sky 2 and SESAR (Single European Sky ATM Research) 2020, and in the near future Clean Aviation and SESAR 3, Leonardo has developed and will develop technologies and solutions to drastically reduce emissions into the atmosphere. Aircraft electrification and digitalisation are the other areas in research in this sector that will have favourable impacts in terms of security, sustainability, growth and profitability. The race to digitalisation is a further key aspect in all the product’s life cycle: from design, with the introduction of digital certification criteria (Certification-by-Simulation), to advanced manufacturing systems (Digital Factory), autonomous flight operations and customer support, with the application of advanced Big Data & Analytics algorithms for diagnostics and predictive maintenance. Furthermore, other digital instruments have been developed for the training of pilots and to ease the work of maintenance workers and fleet managers using enhanced reality instruments for remote maintenance operations. Again within the

Leonardo is also considering the development of a hybrid/electric propulsion system for light helicopters, which will be implemented through the construction of a demonstrator equipped with hybrid-electric propulsion, envisaging an architecture that allows for further future developments, including fuel cells. This demonstrator will be a first platform of a family of new light aircraft equipped with a conventional architecture but with non-conventional propulsion, and will also allow the validation and certification process to be supported, while considering that regulations to govern new propulsion systems are still under development.
Next Generation Civil Tiltrotor (NGCTR) - Leonardo is developing a new model of a more efficient, eco-friendly next generation civil tiltrotor within the Clean Sky 2 Programme, with the objective of reducing CO2 emissions up to 50% and noise emissions by 30% in the take-off phase and up to 75% in the flyover condition compared to the average values of rotarywing aircraft that are currently on the market. Leonardo develops eco-design approaches to the development of specific NGCTR sub-systems within the Programme. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) models have been developed to quantify the environmental benefits obtained from the design of additive manufacturing transmission components and composite wing structures. Supported by detailed LCA models, eco-design approaches will be gradually extended to more complex macrosystems of products in the Helicopter Division. Based on these activities, Leonardo will implement, in the future, an approach in line with the standards ISO 14040 and 14044, delivering training to the main partners in order to gather the data required for LCA assessments.
Aircraft electrification - Research projects, in collaboration with the Leonardo Labs, for the introduction of new power generation and distribution systems for primary functions, such as in-flight power control, and in critical systems, such as rotor anti-icing systems, will allow greater operational flexibility, efficiency and cost reduction to be obtained, all in accordance with the most stringent safety requirements.

Research, development and product engineering A fundamentally important challenge for the Defence Electronics & Security sector is to gain the utmost benefit from research and the latest technological innovations, many of which have come into being in commercial and civil contexts. To this effect, artificial intelligence, quantum sensing and security, big data analytics, 5G and 6G communications, new materials, robotics, blockchain, will be the technologies that are most important to integrate in operations, platforms and the present Defence systems, together with the development of technologies that enable product sizes, weights and power (SWaP) to be reduced. In response to requirements for system transformation, digitalisation and cyber resilience will be essential elements for technological development and in order to remain competitive. The R&D and product engineering activities that are carried out by Leonardo aim to insert these technologies in its products in an increasingly efficient manner, to meet a growing need for security and resilience, in synergy with the Group's Sustainability Plan. In developing new products, great importance is attached to national and international defence programs, including the Eurofighter Typhoon, Forza NEC (Network Enabled Capabilities) for the modernisation of the Italian Armed Forces, the "Naval Law" for the Italian Navy's Multipurpose Offshore Patrol Vessels (PPA, Pattugliatori Polivalenti d'Altura) and the sixth generation Tempest fighter aircraft. The development of Software Defined Radio systems, sensors, terminals and networks (narrowband and broadband on LTE (LongTerm Evolution) / 5G networks), network computing, as well as the evolution of receiver products within the scope of the Galileo program of PRS (Public Regulated Service) geo-localisation, are the main areas of research in the field of professional communications systems and secure satellite communications, with applications for public security and defence. It should be noted that the Electronics Division participates in the European military research and development EDIDP (European Defence Industrial Development Programme) programmes for 2019 and 2020. Specifically, the Electronics Division is taking part in the EDF (European Defence Fund) 2021-2027 programmes, the objective of which is to increase the competitiveness, efficiency and innovation of European Defence at both technological and industrial level and thus make it autonomous towards countries outside the European Union25. Investments in research and improvements in technology are also directed at other types of products and services: avionic, ground and naval radar systems, unmanned systems in the domains of air, land and sea, guided ammunition, development of ground, naval and underwater weapon and defence systems, integrated mission systems (including anti-drone technology), Electronic Warfare and electro-optical laser systems, logistics 4.0 for the Air Force and other Armed Forces, integrated physical security solutions for critical infrastructure with command and control platform, and products for baggage and parcel handling.

3. Aeronautics. 
The aeronautics market is divided into two segments, civil and military, characterized by different dynamics. On the one hand, as regards the military aeronautics segment, there is an increase in demand, in particular for combat aircraft, driven by international tensions and the technological evolution of platforms. On the other hand, among the effects of the pandemic was a sharp fall in the civil aviation segment, especially for airliners; this area was already experiencing a phase of profound change, driven by the search for solutions increasingly based on eco-sustainability in a Green Deal perspective. In the field of military aircraft, Leonardo confirms itself as a major player, active in all generations of air platforms, from the Typhoon, which remains, with 500 units produced, one of the most appreciated 4+ generation multi-role fighters, to the 5th-generation F-35A and F-35B multi-role fighters for Italy and Holland, and to the new 6th-generation fighter, which is better defined as a "system of systems", the Tempest, on which it is working together with other partners in the United Kingdom and Sweden. In the field of civil aircraft, Leonardo strengthens its market leadership in the regional transport segment with ATR, while in the segment of aerostructures, it plays a significant role in the supply of large structural components both in traditional materials (aluminium alloys) and in advanced materials (composites and hybrids), for the commercial aviation programmes of the main OEMs (Boeing and Airbus), for aircraft such as 787, 767, A321 and A220.

New Orders. They showed an increase due to major orders gained in the Aircraft Division, which more than offset the expected downturn in the civil aviation business segment and in particular: • the Aircraft Division acquired substantial export orders for 16 M-346 aircraft, in addition to further orders on the JSF (Joint Strike Fighter) and logistic support programmes for Typhoon aircraft; • the Aerostructures Division was affected by the lack of new orders from customers Boeing (B787 programme) and the GIE consortium, receiving orders only from customer Airbus on the A220 and A321 programmes, which confirmed the growth trend, while demand for B767 remained stable.
Revenues. They were on the rise as a result of higher volumes in the Aircraft Division, which more than offset the downturn in the Aerostructures Division; in particular, we must note: • higher production volumes in the Aircraft Division, specifically on the line of M-346 trainers and the Kuwait programme; • a decline in the Aerostructures Division, which was affected by a reduction in the production rates of the B787 and ATR programmes.
EBITA. It showed growth as a result of a higher contribution on the part of the Aircraft Division and a partial recovery in the business of the GIE-ATR consortium, which more than offset the downturn in the Aerostructures Division. Specifically:

Report on operations at 31 December 2021 • the Aircraft Division benefitted from higher volumes, confirming the high level of profitability; • the GIE-ATR consortium recorded improved results due to cost reduction measures and an increase in deliveries (31 deliveries in 2021 compared to 10 in 2020); • the expected reduction in business volumes and the consequence of the production sites working at lower capacity led to the Aerostructures Division recording a sharply lower result compared to 2020.
Total market of the sector and 2022 Outlook. 
Market (*) 2021-2030. 
CAGR 2021-2030 Impact on the businesses in which Leonardo operates. 
Civil €bil. 1,312 7.8%
Civil sector: demand for new civil aircraft, both for the supply of aerostructures or structural parts and for regional aircraft. All the aviation programs, primarily the Airbus and Boeing programs, and to a lesser extent those of ATR, were affected by a sharp drop in demand due to Covid-19, slowing down the upgrade of platforms over a medium-term period, even if the second half of 2021 recorded signs of increased output, driven by a market showing an initial recovery, at least for short-haul flights.
Defence €bil. 700 6.3%
Defense sector: more than half of the world's demand for military aircraft - manned and unmanned - will be concentrated in the USA and Europe, with demand for combat systems dominating the market, driven by next-generation platforms such as F-35, Tempest and FCAS (Future Combat Air System). Together with the growth in demand for combat aircraft, demand for trainer aircraft and new training platforms will also grow, driven by the significant progress towards the sixth generation and the introduction of multi-aircraft systems, which will result in a substantial evolution in flight operations and therefore in pilot training.
(*) The “Civil” market includes commercial aircraft, aerostructures and components, MRO and UAS services. The “Defence” market includes manned and unmanned aircraft, with logistic support services.
• For the Civil sector, the trend in 2022 will still be heavily conditioned by the effects of the pandemic, with repercussions on production activities associated with the drop in customer demand. In particular, in the Aerostructures Division, a slight increase is expected in the volumes for Airbus only. A recovery trend is confirmed for the GIE consortium in relation to the ATR programme. • For the Aircraft Division, revenue volumes are expected to increase further thanks to the growth of the activities on the proprietary platforms (M-345, M-346 and C-27J), while strong contributions are confirmed from the F35 and EFA Kuwait programmes (9 additional deliveries are expected in addition to the first 2 in 2021).
Research, development and product engineering In the aeronautics sector, Leonardo aircraft increasingly evolve towards complex systems that integrate hightech components and systems and enable their functionality, even within highly integrated and cyber resilient multi-domain environments. The next generation of aeronautical products/systems will need to be able to meet even more stringent requirements in terms of product quality, customer responsiveness and sustainability across the lifecycle. In fact, R&D activities have also been extended to the implementation of methodologies and the development of technologies that foster a reduction in environmental impact and the application of circular economy logics. This approach has also been implemented at the production sites with actions aimed at reducing environmental impact in line with the objectives of the Sustainability Plan. The areas that are most investigated are digitalisation, which involves all company processes and the entire product life cycle, electrification for sustainable mobility, autonomy, simulation and innovative materials and production processes. Technological developments and growth in the areas mentioned above are supported through enabling technologies such as AI and HPC. The Aircraft Division is committed to actively supporting technological transformation and growth with research investments financed in the civil sector at national (Innovation for Nacelles - I4N) and European (Clean Sky, SESAR) level, aimed at producing technologies capable of enabling the development of solutions

4. SPACE. 
The Space sector is of supreme importance, both in the civil and in the military segment, because it makes it possible to carry out ongoing monitoring of the Planet's resources, both natural and artificial, as well as to offer communication and localisation solutions in remote areas, thus ensuring access to basic services for communities and connecting activities and citizens. The market in this sector is divided between upstream (manufacturing of space systems), midstream (manufacturing of launch systems and services, as well as manufacturing of ground systems) and downstream (end-user services, including communication, geoinformation, navigation) activities.
Leonardo is present in this market in the framework of the Space Alliance, through Thales Alenia Space (TAS) and Telespazio. Specifically, Telespazio offers a complete series of services in the main operational domains – from communications to navigation, from Earth observation to space exploration. These services cover the widest range of purposes from supporting healthcare institutions to logistics, from monitoring vehicle fleets to monitoring critical infrastructure and hazardous sites, from precision agriculture to civil protection, from the prevention of hydrogeological instability and support in caring for architectural sites to monitoring natural resources and pollution. These applications, which are at the centre of Leonardo’s Sustainability Plan, have a key role in everyday life, in the protection of the environment and in managing emergencies, readily supporting the Institutions with the capacity to combine big volumes of satellite data and very high resolution images with data from land-based sensors, at sea or in aeroplanes, and with archives and social media.
Furthermore, Leonardo manufactures, within the Electronics Division, essential components of space systems, such as electro-optical payloads for Earth observation and planetary exploration (e.g., COSMO SkyMed, PRISMA, MTG, EarthCare, Rosetta, ExoMars, LISA Pathfinder, BepiColombo), as well as attitude sensors and atomic clocks, which are required for satellite navigation systems (e.g. Galileo).

Report on operations at 31 December 2021. 
Below is the performance on the sector during the last 4 years: 

In 2021, the sector recorded values, in terms of key indicators, which were well above those of 2020, the year in which the effects of the pandemic had heavily affected its commercial performance, production volumes and profitability, specifically in the manufacturing segment.
The results of operations showed a sharp increase, in the manufacturing segment, thanks to revenues going back to pre-pandemic levels, a marked increase in profitability that was also due to a greater reduction of extra costs on telecommunications programmes, and the excellent performance of the Observation, Exploration and Navigation domain and in particular of TAS Italia.
There was also progress with the satellite services business segment, which recorded a solid performance this year too and extraordinary volumes of orders that was such as to guarantee a substantial order backlog to support volumes in the years to come.
To the aforesaid industrial performance must be added the significant economic benefit recorded on the Italian component of the manufacturing business arising from the effects of the realignment of the tax value of goodwill, in accordance with the concession schemes provided under the Decree on "Urgent measures to support and relaunch economy", as converted with amendments into Law 126 of 13 October 2020 and the subsequent Budget Law 2021.
From an operational point of view, 2021 was characterised by the following events in the manufacturing segment: • the launch of Syracuse 4a and SES 17 satellites in October; • the start of the launch campaign for the second Cosmo satellite at the end of December, which was successfully completed on 1 February of 2022; • the completion of Sentinel 3C's payload equipment, thanks to the successful integration of the SLSTR (Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer) radiometric sensor supplied by Leonardo; • the completion of KVHTS (KONNECT - Very High Throughput Satellite) ready for testing in the thermal vacuum chamber.

€bil. 1,391 4.7%
Manufacturing: Demand growth driven by increasing demand for constellations made up of smaller, more efficient and less complex satellites. Services: Space is and will continue to be an area of increasing development with steady growth for players providing communication and observation and increasingly, innovative services to support space exploration.
2022 is expected to be characterised by growing business volumes supported by a robust backlog and improving operating profitability, especially on the manufacturing segment, which has been steadily recovering, albeit in a fiercely competitive context in terms of prices, timing of execution and innovation, particularly in the telecommunications domain. Solid fundamentals are confirmed for the satellite services segment in Europe and Latin America at commercial and operating level. Research, development and product engineering. 
The close link between space and the environment has also often been referred to by the United Nations, which has emphasised that space infrastructure and technology are an enabling factor, through new services and applications, for the attainment of each of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the 2030 Agenda. The various geo-information applications and services that Leonardo is able to provide, in fact, have a strong environmental and social impact. The fact that there is such a variety of possible applications shows that Space is, and will continue to be, an area of steadily increasing development with a continuous increase in players and services, with civil and military applications, borne witness to by the rapidly growing numbers of private firms operating in all segments of space and which also develop launching or transport technologies that were the prerogative of governments for years; these newcomers are now starting to show that they have greater and greater business potential, while governments and space agencies increasingly focus their attention on exploration and the possible exploitation of extraplanetary resources.
Solutions that add satellite navigation to hybrid satellite communications and geoinformation and HPC, which, in the near future, will also enable 5G technology and related protocols to be included transparently were, in 2021, and will continue to be, in the near future, the main elements of projects related to the understanding of climate change and definition of decision support tools, including and especially in emergency conditions, for space exploration, for agro-food policies, etc..
Digital Twin Earth Precursor (DTEP) – This is an ESA project coordinated by Telespazio UK for the development of a technological prototype of an ultra-high precision digital Earth model that is capable of increasing understanding of the local impact of climate change on a global scale. In using a highresolution digital reconstruction of the Earth, it is possible to expand decision-making capabilities, make increasingly advanced predictions and simulations, and address current environmental and societal challenges. The "Climate Impact Explorer" prototype is focused on providing advanced metrics of drought frequency and water stress parameters in climate change scenarios, in areas of the African continent and the United Kingdom.
Moonlight – This is ESA's initiative for the creation of Lunar Communications and Navigation Services (LCNS) and the related infrastructures to support commercial and institutional missions for the exploration of the Earth's satellite, while fostering the development of a true Lunar Economy. The project, which is coordinated by Telespazio and started in 2021, aims, through a system of lunar and terrestrial stations and a network of satellites that are all coordinated by the Fucino’s Space Center, to reduce the complexity of missions by making available navigation signals to guide orbiters and landers/rovers and to support the navigation and communications of human and robotic exploration missions.

Report on operations at 31 December 2021 "NON-GAAP" ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE INDICATORS. 
Leonardo’s Management assesses the Group’s performance and that of its business segments based on a number of indicators that are not envisaged by the IFRSs. Specifically, EBITA is used as the primary indicator of profitability, since it allows us to analyse the Group’s marginality by eliminating the impacts of the volatility associated with non-recurring, extraordinary items or items unrelated to ordinary operations.
As required by CESR/05-178b Recommendation, below is a description of the components of each of these indicators: • New orders: this includes contracts entered into with customers during the period that have commercial substance and represent an obligation for both parties to fulfil the contract.
• Order backlog: this figure is the sum of the order backlog for the preceding period and new orders, less revenues during the reference period.
• EBITDA: this is given by EBITA, as defined below, before amortisation (excluding amortisation of intangible assets from business combinations), depreciation and impairment losses (net of those relating to goodwill or classified among “non-recurring costs”).
• EBITA: it is arrived at by eliminating from EBIT, as defined below, the following items: - any impairment in goodwill; - amortisation and impairment, if any, of the portion of the purchase price allocated to intangible assets as part of business combinations, as required by IFRS 3; - restructuring costs that are a part of defined and significant plans. This item includes personnel costs as well as any and all other costs deriving from the reorganisation (e.g. impairment of assets, costs for the closure of sites, relocation costs, etc.); - other non-recurring or unusual costs or income, i.e. connected to particularly significant or exceptional events that are not related to the ordinary performance of the business. The item includes charges incurred during M&A transactions, charges linked to disposed businesses and/or products and systems, and the recognition of losses on contracts that have become onerous as a result of non-operating events.
EBITA is then used to calculate return on sales (ROS) and return on investment (ROI).
A reconciliation of Income before tax and financial expense, EBIT and EBITA is shown below (the reconciliation by segment is reported in Note 8): 
(€ millions) 2020 2021. 
Income before tax and financial expenses 494 787.

Non-recurring charges include (i) costs incurred to be in line with the instructions given by the government on Covid-19 to support the governmental functions in managing the emergency, and (ii) costs incurred following incurred following the settlement of the Indian case (iii) other charges.
Restructuring costs for the year mainly relate to agreements governing the early retirement of the Aerostructures division’s workforce on a voluntary basis.
• Return on Sales (ROS): this is calculated as the ratio of EBITA to revenue.


 
62. 
Report on operations at 31 December 2021 • EBIT: this is obtained by adding to Income before tax and financial expenses (defined as earnings before “financial income and expense”, “share of profits (losses) of equity-accounted investees”, “income taxes” and “Profit (loss) from discontinued operations”) the Group’s share of profit in the results of its strategic Joint Ventures (ATR, MBDA, Thales Alenia Space and Telespazio), reported in the “share of profits (losses) of equity-accounted investees”.

• Free Operating Cash-Flow (FOCF): this is the sum of the cash flows generated by (used in) operating activities (excluding the changes in the Group Net Debt), the cash flows generated by (used in) ordinary investing activities (investment and divestment of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, and equity investments, net of cash flows from the purchase or sale of equity investments that, due to their nature or significance, are considered “strategic investments”) and dividends received. The calculation of FOCF is presented in the reclassified statement of cash flows shown in the section “Group results and financial position”.
• Return on Investments (ROI): this is calculated as the ratio of EBITA to the average net capital invested in the two comparative periods.
• Funds From Operations (FFO): this is cash flow generated by (used in) operating activities net of changes in working capital and the repayment of debts under Law 808/1985, included within “Cash flow from ordinary investing activities” in the reclassified statement of cash flows. The FFO also includes dividends received.
• Return on Equity (ROE): this is calculated as the ratio of the net result before extraordinary transactions for the financial period to the average value of equity in the two comparative periods.
• Net interest: this is calculated as the sum of the items “Interest”, “Premiums (paid) received on IRSs” and “Commissions on borrowings” (see the Note on “Financial income and expense” of the consolidated financial statements).

Report on operations at 31 December 2021 completion of the integration process between the two companies that had been started in 2019 with the acquisition of the entire capital of Vitrociset.

On 24 March 2021 Leonardo US Holding, Inc. postponed the initial public offering (“IPO”) of a minority shareholding of Leonardo DRS, since, notwithstanding investor interest within the price range during the course of the roadshow, adverse market conditions did not allow an adequate valuation of the company. Leonardo DRS remains a core part of Leonardo’s business portfolio and the IPO will potentially be revisited when market conditions are more favourable and a successful IPO at an appropriate valuation for this strategic business can be achieved.

In addition to these industrial transactions, there are numerous joint venture and partnership agreements, in line with the principles of the "Be Tomorrow - Leonardo 2030" Strategic Plan.
Financial transactions. During the 2021 financial year Leonardo completed major capital market transactions. In particular: • in January it used an amount of €mil. 200 of the loan taken out with the European Investment Bank (EIB) in December 2020, aimed at supporting some investment projects envisaged in the Group’s business plan; • again in January it proceeded with the early cancellation, which had been requested at the end of December 2020, of the remaining amount of about €mil. 250 of the Term Loan taken out with a pool of international banks during the Covid-19 emergency period in May 2020, but never used for this purpose; • finally, again in January, it repaid the remaining portion (€mil. 739) of the bond issue for an initial amount of €mil. 950, which had been launched under the EMTN Programme in 2013 and which had reached its natural expiry; • in October 2021 it entered, with a pool of international and national banks, into an ESG-linked Revolving Credit Facility agreement for an amount of €bil. 2.4, structured into a 5-year term tranche of €bil. 1.8 and a 3-year term tranche of €mil. 600. The new credit facility replaces the two existing Revolving Credit Facilities – amounting to €mil. 1,800 and €mil. 1,250 –, which have been cancelled at the same time, thus reducing the overall cost of the borrowing available to meet the Group’s financial requirements and extending its term until 2026. The ESG-linked Revolving Credit Facility is subject to the same financial covenants as are already provided for in the other agreements signed by Leonardo. In line with the sustainability strategy of Leonardo, the new credit facility is linked for the first time to specific ESG indicators, including the reduction of CO2 emissions through eco-efficiency of industrial processes and the promotion of female employment with degrees in STEM education. The aforesaid ESG indicators also contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which are behind about 50% of the Group's investments. The achievement of ESG-linked targets will trigger an adjustment to the margin applied to the credit facility; • finally, in December it entered, with a pool of national and international banks, into a Term Loan ESG-linked credit facility for an amount of €mil. 600, with a term of 5 years and expiring at the beginning of 2027, aimed at repaying a bond maturing in January 2022. The credit facility is linked to specific ESG indicators, which are already included in the aforesaid ESG-linked Revolving Credit

Report on operations at 31 December 2021. 
Facility signed in October; in this case too, the achievement of the ESG-linked targets will trigger an adjustment to the margin applied to the credit facility.
Moreover, in June the EMTN (Euro Medium Term Note) programme was renewed for further 12 months, which regulates possible bond issues on the European market for a maximum nominal value of €bil. 4. At the date of this report, the Programme is used for a total of €bil. 2.2.
After the end of the 2021 financial year, and more precisely in January 2022, the bond issued for €mil. 556 in December 2009 was repaid, having reached its natural expiry. It should also be noted that in January 2022 Leonardo took steps to pay an amount of €mil. 606 (net of transaction costs) for the acquisition of a quota in Hensoldt AG, as detailed in the section on Industrial Transactions.
In addition to being the issuer of all the bonds in Euros placed on the market under the EMTN programme, Leonardo acts as a guarantor for the bond issues launched by Leonardo US Holding Inc. on the US market. The Group’s issues are governed by rules with standard legal clauses for these types of corporate transactions on institutional markets that do not require any undertaking with regard to compliance with specific financial parameters (financial covenants) but they do require negative pledge and cross-default clauses. Based on negative pledge clauses, Group issuers, Leonardo and their “Material Subsidiaries” (companies in which Leonardo owns more than 50% of the share capital and the gross revenues and total assets of which represent at least 10% of consolidated gross revenues and total assets) are expressly prohibited from pledging collateral security or other obligations to secure their debt in the form of bonds or listed financial instruments or financial instruments that qualify for listing, unless these guarantees are extended to all bondholders. Exceptions to this prohibition are securitisation and, as from July 2006, the establishment of assets for the use indicated in Article 2447-bis et seq. of the Italian Civil Code. On the contrary, the crossdefault clauses give the bondholders the right to request early redemption of the bonds in their possession in the event of default by the Group issuers and/or Leonardo and/or any “Material Subsidiary” that results in a failure to make payment beyond pre-set limits.

On the other hand, it should be noted that financial covenants are included in the abovementioned ESGlinked Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan ESG-linked entered into in 2021, and require Leonardo to comply with two Financial ratios (the ratio of Group net debt - excluding payables to the joint ventures MBDA and Thales Alenia Space and lease liabilities/EBITDA including amortisation of the right of use of no more than 3.75 and an EBITDA, including amortisation of the right of use/ net interest ratio of no less than 3.25) which are tested on an annual basis on year-end consolidated data and which had been complied with in full at 31 December 2021. These covenants are also included in the loan agreement with CDP for € mil. 100 and in the Term Loan of €mil. 500 (entered into in 2018); furthermore, in accordance with contractual provisions providing for this option, these covenants have also been extended to all the EIB loans in place (used for a total amount of €mil. 546 at 31 December 2021), as well as to certain loans granted in past years to Leonardo DRS by US banks.
In relation to this Annual Financial Report, there was full compliance with the covenants (the two ratios are 1.2 and 11.1, respectively).
Outstanding bond issues are given a medium/long-term financial credit rating by the international rating agencies: Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s), Standard & Poor’s and Fitch. In view of the possibility that Leonardo's cash generation may improve in the following 12-24 months, in January 2022 Fitch improved the Leonardo’ outlook from negative to stable. On the reporting date, Leonardo’s credit ratings, compared to those preceding the last change, were as follows:

Credit Rating Outlook. 
Moody's October 2018 Ba1 positive Ba1 stable. 
Standard&Poor's April 2020 BB+ positive BB+ stable. 
Fitch January 2022 BBB- negative BBB- stable. 
With regard to the impact of positive or negative changes in Leonardo’s credit ratings, there are no default clauses linked to the credit ratings. The only possible effects deriving from further changes, if any, to the credit ratings refer to higher or lower finance costs on certain payables of the Group, especially with reference to the ESG-linked Revolving Credit Facility, the Term Loan ESG-linked and to the Term Loan (entered into in 2018) as provided for in the related agreements. Finally, for the sake of completeness, it should be noted that the Funding Agreement between MBDA and its shareholders provides, inter alia, that any downgrade of the rating assigned to the shareholders will result in a gradual increase in interest rates. Additionally, under a pre-set rating limit (for at least two out of three rating agencies: BB- from Standards & Poor's, BB- from Fitch and Ba3 from Moody’s) MBDA is entitled to determine the applicable margin each time. Finally, the agreement provides for rating limits the achievement of which allows MBDA to request the issue of a bank guarantee from its shareholders.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE. 
Leonardo’s corporate governance model, based on a traditional organisational structure, complies with the Corporate Governance Code for Listed Companies (approved by the Corporate Governance Committee and promoted by, among others, the Italian Stock Exchange) and with the international best practices.

During its term, the BoD may draw on support from the Board internal committees that make proposals and provide advice. The current BoD was appointed by the Shareholders’ Meeting held on 20 May 2020 for the three-year period from 2020 to 2022, in compliance with the criteria for gender, age, skills and experience balance set in the policies on diversity. Following its appointment, the Board set up four committees from among its members, with functions in the areas of Control and Risks, Remuneration, Nomination and Governance, Sustainability and Innovation.

Report on operations at 31 December 2021. 
In 2021 Leonardo adopted an engagement policy aimed at promoting and regulating opportunities to meet and discuss with financial stakeholders ("Engagement Policy for managing the dialogue with the general public of shareholders and other stakeholders"). The scope of the policy includes the requests for direct interaction with the Company that are submitted by financial stakeholders on issues concerning the economic and financial results and outlook, the Industrial and Strategic Plan, corporate governance, social and environmental sustainability, the remuneration policy for directors and managers with strategic responsibilities, the internal control and risk management system, and the Company's policies on ethics, transparency and anti-corruption. Remuneration policy The objective of the remuneration and incentive policy in 2021 was to attract and motivate people with the professional skills to carry out assignments and fulfil responsibilities assigned to them, in line with the management’s interests and with the priority objective of creating value in the medium- to long-term. To this end, the policy has been designed in order to ensure a balance between the variable component of remuneration and the fixed one, while also establishing a balance between short- and long-term incentives, and an alignment of the remuneration and incentive system with the pursuit of long-term interests (in terms of both economic-financial performance and ESG), ensuring that the variable component of remuneration is connected with the results achieved and paying great attention to the objectivity of metrics used to measure performance28.

Constantly raising the awareness and training of employees and third parties, due diligence tools and internal audits, risk assessment methods, in addition to the adoption of an increasingly transparent approach on corporate information and processes, help to strengthen a governance and management system capable of preventing any possible risk, promoting and developing an ethical business culture. Leonardo has also adopted the Common Industry Standards of the 28 For more details, reference should be made to the Remuneration Report 2021. 29 In addition to the CEO, population involved in the short-term incentive Plan (MBO) of Leonardo Group is equal to about 1,050 managers, including Managers with Strategic Responsibilities and Top Managers of Leonardo.

Scope of audits and follow-ups. 
Anti-corruption, business compliance and third-party risk Leonardo has implemented a process for the vetting of counterparties that includes ethical-reputational analyses and an in-depth assessment of the risks related to each specific engagement in accordance with company rules and in full compliance with applicable regulations. Due diligence audits are also carried out on counterparties under industrial offset agreements. In 2021, at the same time as the issue of the related company rules, Leonardo strengthened the system to identify the level of risk associated with the positions of Sales Promotion, Commercial Advisory, Lobbying, Distribution and Reseller, with a thorough review of the definitions of the relevant red flags due to the need to adapt the Company's analyses and audits to changes in the applicable regulations, as well as the experience gained in the previous three years.
180 counterparties including sales promoters, commercial advisors, distributors, resellers and lobbyists, with contracts in place, 3 of which for offset support 31 
1,476 due diligence and reputational risk analyses carried out on counterparties and potential commercial partners. 
More than 200 hours of training delivered to sales promoters, commercial advisors and lobbyists through online courses. 
Leonardo carries out activities aimed at institutions to support its reputation and business strategy, present the company's position on specific issues and seize potential future business opportunities. These activities, which are carried out in compliance with current regulations, as well as with the principles and standards of conduct set out in Leonardo's Code of Ethics, Anti-Corruption Code and other company rules, mainly consist of monitoring specific regulatory developments and organising meetings with government and parliamentary representatives on matters of interest. Leonardo’s representatives who carry out these activities are enrolled in special public registers. With the recent update of its company rules, Leonardo has decided to no longer allow the Italian Group companies to sign lobbying contracts. However, this option has been maintained for foreign subsidiaries, although only in those countries where the regulations permit the execution of said contracts. The decision has been taken on the basis of the current wording of Art. 346-bis of the Italian Criminal Code and in consideration of the lack of organic regulations governing lobbying in Italy.
31 The increase (145 in 2020) reflects the extension of the scope of application of the new Business Compliance Procedure and of the review of the Directive, which also includes Distributors and Resellers, in addition to Sales Promoters and Commercial Advisors (as well as Lobbyists for Foreign subsidiaries).

In 2021, the expenses for lobbying activities carried out exclusively by the Group's foreign subsidiaries amounted to approximately USDmil. 1.8 (a figure that remained unchanged compared to 2020, USDmil. 1.5 million in both 2019 and 2018), referring mainly to North America (the United States, primarily) and Poland. In particular, among the main areas for which the Group’s foreign subsidiaries made use of the support from lobbyists during the year are those involving the development of technologies for infrastructure and transport, the purchase and/or upgrade of aircraft on the part of government agencies, including aircraft for firefighting, search and rescue missions, research and development programmes for submarine programmes, naval systems, ground-based and satellite communication systems. Trade compliance Leonardo has set out a Group Trade Compliance Program to ensure full compliance with applicable laws and the provisions issued by the competent authorities in the field of Trade Compliance. Furthermore, the program allows for the prompt identification and implementation of compliance with applicable national, EU and international regulations regarding the export and import of defence, dual-use or commercial goods and/or services subject to regulatory requirements, as well as obligations related to embargoes, sanctions or other trade restrictions.
The Trade Compliance Program also provides for due diligence audits on potential customers and end-users, verifying whether they are mentioned in restriction lists and additional checks in the case of transactions linked to Sensitive Countries, as well as specific checks to verify that internationally recognised human rights are respected32. Cybersecurity and data protection Leonardo guarantees the security of data, sensitive information and intellectual property by managing the entire cycle from detection of threats to establishing the countermeasures to take in response to attacks that have taken place. The cyber defence system provides for specific organisational measures - in compliance with regulations and standards that set out specific requirements and time limits for reporting incidents or data breaches -, as well as continuous training of operators and operational tools, concentrated in Italy and in the United Kingdom, which are updated on an ongoing basis. Leonardo also fosters a cyber risk prevention culture both inside the company and towards the outside world through the participation in working groups at national and international level, with collaborations involving institutional and governmental players and sectors such as telecommunications, banking/finance, energy, manufacturing and services. Courses and awareness initiatives are provided periodically on cybersecurity-related issues, including through bulletins and news published on the Security Portal accessible from employees.

RISK MANAGEMENT. 
The risk governance model is in line with national and international standards and best practices33 and is compliant with the Corporate Governance Code for Listed Companies, the Organisational, Management and Control Model and the Group’s Anti-Corruption Code. It has three levels, provides for clear-cut roles and responsibilities for the various departments and ensures a suitable exchange of information flows, to guarantee effectiveness.
Risk governance model. 
The operating risk management, which involves the entire organisation, is based on the identification, assessment and monitoring of the enterprise and project risks and the related mitigation plans. It is supported by specific methodologies, instruments and metrics for the related analysis and management. The processes underlying Project Risk Management and Enterprise Risk Management, which are in turn integrated into the company business and support processes, are regularly improved, with the aim of innovating and spreading an effective risk-based organisational culture. Risk management processes support, in fact, the risk owners, along the entire corporate value chain, in identifying and managing risks and opportunities, including those linked to ESG factors. In particular, the Enterprise Risk Management methodology fosters the identification and management of the cause-effect link between ESG factors and the potential impact on the Company (strategic, operational, financial, compliance and reputational) and supports the preparation of the Strategic, Industrial and Sustainability Plans. Risks for the Group The Group is subject to a number of risks that may affect the achievement of its objectives and results. Therefore, risk analysis and management processes are implemented systematically, including any related treatment action, with specific methodologies and practices that consider the probability of occurrence and related impacts in accordance with international regulations and standards. The examination of risks and consequent actions reported below is supplemented by the more detailed information provided in Note 37 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the component of merely financial risks.

Variability of effects related to pandemic events. 
The occurrence of a pandemic can undermine personal health to such a point as to endanger the endurance of the health and socio-economic systems of the countries involved. The duration and magnitude of a pandemic depends, among other things, on the promptness and efficacy of measures to protect health taken at global level, even in consideration of any possible mutation of the circulating virus and the coverage and termination of immunisation campaigns.
In relation to COVID-19, Leonardo Group’s performance may be affected by the impact arising from the downturn in the civil aviation sector, as well as by volatility of some risk factors, including: the economic recovery trend and market performance, asymmetries between supply and demand for certain goods and services, inflationary effects, shortages of certain professional skills; the customers’ and suppliers’ capacity to fulfil the contractual obligations they have entered into and assume others; customers’ revision of procurement strategies; restrictions deriving from measures taken to protect personal health, with repercussions on the Group’s commercial and industrial operations.
In addition to making all possible efforts to preserve its people’s health and safety in full compliance with the relevant rules, the Leonardo Group has put special plans of action in place to limit the possible repercussions of risk factors associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.
The plans of action concern, among other things: constructive management of relations with customers, whether institutional or not, thanks to a widespread presence all over the world, balanced with the application of tools that virtualise promotion and marketing; the adoption of satisfactory financial solutions and an even more selective approach to expenditure in order to maintain financial flexibility in support of both current operations and development actions; the prompt reorganisation of production lines together with carrying out certain technical functions on a remote basis and ongoing oversight of the company’s supply chain and procurement strategy.

The change in the level of expenditure of national governments and public institutions may affect business performance. 
The major customers of the Group are national Governments or public Institutions. Moreover, the Group takes part in numerous national and international programmes funded by the European Union, governments or multinational collaborations. Therefore, it is affected by economic and geopolitical factors at global and regional level, the expense policies of the public Institutions, also for research and development programmes funding, in addition to the medium/long-term plans of the Governments.
The Group pursues an international diversification strategy, placing it in its main markets, as well as in emerging markets marked by significant growth rates, in the aerospace, defence and security sectors.

The Group operates in civil sectors that are highly exposed to growing levels of competition. 
In the civil sectors, customers’ diminished spending capacity not only gives rise to delays in obtaining new orders or falls in the numbers of orders themselves, but also affect their economic and financial conditions. These sectors are also characterised by the entry and success of competitors even from other fields of activity, mostly with the help of anti-cyclical M&A transactions carried out by international investment funds. The market positioning of these players could have an impact on the Group's volumes, results and debt, thus prospectively enabling a growing competitive challenge on government customers.
In addition to balancing its customer portfolio suitably between government and non- government entities, the Group systematically pursues its objectives in order to increase industrial efficiency, diversify its customer base and improve its ability to perform contracts, while reducing overhead costs with a view to enhance its competitive capacity.
The Group ensures highly qualitative and innovative product standards, and an integrated value proposition aimed at maintaining its technological edge, including thanks to open innovation and the interaction with innovative startups and SMEs.

Main risks Actions. 
The capacity for innovation and growth depends on the strategic planning and management of skills. 
Incessant technological innovation and the growing complexity of the Group's businesses require constant alignment of skills, in order to provide high added-value products and services. Especially in a market environment characterised by sharp demand for innovation skills, any shortage of special expertise and the obsolescence of certain competencies and professional skills could have impacts on the full achievement of short- and medium/long-term business objectives, including possible repercussions in terms of time-to-market of new products and services, as well as of access to emerging business segments.
The Group monitors and manages competencies and professional skills by means of plans of action directed at attracting, retaining and motivating its human resources, managing talents, providing ongoing specialist training and reskilling/upskilling, insourcing core competencies and defining succession plans, with the gradual adoption of state-of-the-art tools of People Analytics and new Lifelong Learning development and training platforms for all personnel, particularly in the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering &
Mathematics) area.

The Group operates in some business segments through partnerships or joint ventures. 
The corporate strategies contemplate the possibility of gaining business opportunities partly through joint ventures or commercial alliances in order to integrate its technology portfolio or strengthen its presence in the market. The operation of partnerships and joint ventures is subject to both strategic positioning and management risks and uncertainties. Divergences can arise between partners about the identification and achievement of operational and strategic objectives, as well as core business operations.
The Group systematically carries out due diligence activities before and after the completion of partnerships and joint ventures. At this purpose, the active involvement of its top management in any related operation is aimed, among other things, at directing its strategies and identifying and managing any critical issue in a timely fashion.

The Group is exposed to the risk of fraud or illegal activities on the part of employees and third parties. 
The Group adopts and updates its organisational, control, procedural and training system to ensure fraud risk monitoring and compliance with any and all anticorruption laws applicable in the domestic and foreign markets in which it operates. The possibility of employees or third parties behaving in an ethically incorrect or not fully compliant manner cannot be ruled out, nor can be ruled out the possibility of judicial authorities initiating proceedings aimed at establishing any possible liability attributable to the Group, the results and timing of which are difficult to determine and which might entail temporary suspensions from the market concerned.
The Group has set out a model of responsible business conduct aimed at preventing, identifying and responding to the risk of corruption.
Thanks to its model, Leonardo SpA has reached the highest level of Transparency International’s Defence Companies Index on Anti-Corruption and Corporate Transparency (DCI), in addition to having its ISO 37001 certification, the first international standard on anti-corruption management system, confirmed. Leonardo was the first company in the world's top ten in Aerospace, Defence and Security to obtain this certification. The model also provides for the responsible management of the supply chain, through the qualification, selection and management of suppliers, as well as the adoption of a risk analysis tool within the scope of due diligence audits within the process of engagement assignation to sales promoters, commercial advisor and lobbyists.

Some of these proceedings in which the Group is involved – for which a negative outcome is unlikely or that cannot be quantified – are not covered by the provisions referred to above.
Further developments of judicial proceedings, presently unforeseeable and indefinable, together with the possible consequential impact on Leonardo’s reputation, could also have a significant impact on its relationships with customers.
corrective actions and adjusting its provisions for risks on a quarterly basis.

The Group operates in particularly complex and regulated markets, which require compliance with specific regulations (e.g. export control)
Defence solutions are of particular importance in terms of compliance with regulatory obligations and, therefore, their export is strictly regulated and is subject to prior authorization, based on specific national and foreign regulations (such as, for example, Italian Law 185/1990 and the U.S. International Traffic in Arms Regulations - ITAR and the Export Administration Regulations - EAR), as well as to customs formalities. The prohibition on, limitation or any possible revocation (for example in the case of embargoes, geopolitical tensions or the occurrence of wars) of export authorisations for defence or dual-use products, as well as failure to comply with any applicable customs regime, may have substantial adverse effects on the Group's business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Moreover, failure to comply with these regulations could also make it impossible for the Group to operate in specific regulated areas.
The Group ensures, through specific functions, a timely implementation and management of the formalities required by the relevant regulations, monitoring their updating on an ongoing basis in order to allow the day-to-day performance of commercial and operational activities, in compliance with the provisions of law and with any possible authorisation and/or limitation and of its Policy of respect for human rights. The Group has promptly made arrangements to carry out the changes necessary as a result of Britain’s exit from the European Union and is continuing to follow developments in customs regulations in order to carry out the necessary modifications immediately.

The Group operates through a number of industrial plants and processes that may expose it to risks to the health and safety of workers and to environmental risks. 
The Group's activities are subject to compliance with laws, rules and regulations governing the protection of workers’ health and safety. Specifically, Legislative Decree 81/2008 provides for a preventive and permanent health and safety management system at work, through the identification of risk factors and sources, the elimination or reduction of risk, the ongoing monitoring of preventive measures implemented, the development of a corporate strategy to be implemented through the participation of all stakeholders in the working communities.
The Group's activities are also subject to compliance with laws, rules and regulations governing the protection of environment and energy management, which imply specific environmental permits aimed at ensuring the compliance with restrictions and conditions on emissions into the atmosphere, water discharges, storage and use of chemical or hazardous. 
Risks to the workers’ health and safety are based on the principle of zero tolerance, in strict compliance with the relevant regulations, and are managed through targeted risk analyses, which take account of injury frequency and severity rates and related improvement objectives, specific action and training plans, within the framework of a precise system of proxies and powers for each relevant matter, aimed at ensuring that the action taken complies with the Group’s guidelines. The Group also confirms its commitment to extend the coverage in terms of Health and Safety System, for example through the ISO 45001 certification. The Group is also committed to protecting the safety of its people working on company sites and in direct relations with customers around the world from external threats.

Main risks Actions substances (e.g. REACH Regulation and RoHS Directive) and waste management and disposal.
The Group complies with the ever-increasing limits and restrictions imposed by the environmental protection regulations as regards sites and production processes. The Group also confirms its commitment to extend coverage in terms of Environmental Management System, for example through the ISO 14001 certification. The Group regularly performs environmental assessments of sites and monitoring, and it also takes out specific insurance policies in order to mitigate the consequences of unexpected events.

Climate change, the protection of the environment and consequent new developments in the scenario concerned may require action to be taken on certain types of processes and products. 
The transition to a low-carbon and more environmentally sustainable economy may entail risks for the company, induced by greater severity of environmental and climate policies, the progress of the relevant technology or the changing confidence of investors and lenders. Company processes, particularly production processes, as well as products and services offered to the market may be affected.
Furthermore, the impact of climate change exposes the Company to an increased frequency of acute weather events (e.g., drought, floods, and storms) and the progressive modification of climate and the environmental context.
The Group pursues an industrial strategy aimed improving the efficiency of its production systems and processes on an ongoing basis for the reduction of energy consumption and atmospheric emissions and, thanks also to the participation, as a partner of excellence, in the main European programs for research and innovation, develops low environmental impact technological solutions which are functional to the fight against climate change.
The Group puts measures in place against any possible acute or chronic physical risks and has specific insurance cover against the possible consequences of disastrous climatic or natural events.

Breaches of information security obligations can cause damage to the Group, its customers and suppliers and pose a threat to the security of citizens and critical infrastructures. 
Companies are required to face the risks associated with information security, deriving from ceaseless evolutions in cyber threats in its numerous forms (from advanced persistent threat to the phishing campaign), the sophistication of attack strategies and a greater exposed surface area resulting from, among other things, the increasing digitisation of processes, products and services for customers, as well as the increased use of remote working. The critical geopolitical context, the deterioration of relations between states or the occurrence of war conflicts may increase the scope and number of cyber attacks, aimed at institutions and companies.
Computer incidents, including any in the supply chain, stoppages, leaks of personal data and the loss of information that may also be of strategic importance may endanger business and even the Group’s image, above all in the event of the theft of third-party data kept in the Group’s archives.
The Group manages cyber security through dedicated controls and training for the entire corporate population, as well as processes, procedures and specific technologies for the prediction, prevention, detection and management of potential threats and for responding to them. Leonardo is ISO 27001 certified and is constantly engaged in management and improvement activities aimed at maintaining the certification itself.
Leonardo also benefits from substantial experience in the field of cyber security, gained on the market through the competent business Division. In addition to a continuous improvement in the methods of managing permissions of access to information, Leonardo continues to take any action to extend data and information protection and processing methods and processes to its own suppliers.

Main risks Actions. 
The Group could encounter difficulties in protecting its Intellectual Property. 
Leonardo's success and results also depend on the Company's ability to protect the innovations resulting from its R&D activities through Intellectual Property. In this respect, the Group mainly uses industrial secrets, patents, copyrights. Nevertheless, the possibility cannot be ruled out that the activity of a “disloyal” employee, an improper action of a supplier or a legal but aggressive act of a third party may lead to repercussions on the company’s Intellectual Property. Furthermore, there is a greater risk of counterfeiting in highly technological environments such as that in which Leonardo operates, given the high number of patents held by third parties.
The Group is committed to the continuous improvement of its Intellectual Property protection processes, from the approval of research and development investments, through the definition and implementation of measures to protect technical information and proprietary know-how. Appropriate monitoring and surveillance actions are taken to detect any infringements by suppliers, partners or competitors. Of particular importance is the creation, the expansion and the penetration of the internal IP Correspondent networks in the Divisions.

The Group provides highly complex products, systems and services, including under long-term fixedprice contracts. 
The Group supplies products, systems and services that are particularly complex due to their advanced technological content, including under long-term contracts at a fixed all-inclusive price. Terms and conditions of contracts generally include challenging requirements and rigorous completion times, the failure to honour which may entail the payment of penalties, in addition to warranty liability and claims for damage that are not covered in full by insurance policies. Furthermore, an unforeseen rise in the costs incurred in the performance of a contract, which may also be the result of the occurrence of chance events, could lead to a lower profit. In this regard, attention must also be paid to the structural effects of market phases characterised by inflation, over-demand, lack or discontinuity of supply of goods (including commodities) and services necessary for production and delivery to the customer, with consequent greater execution times and costs for the company. These dynamics may also be determined, accelerated or exacerbated by the deterioration of institutional and commercial relations between sovereign states or by the onset of war conflicts.
From the commercial offer phase and at regular intervals during the performance of the contract, Leonardo considers the projects’ main performance and financial parameters in order to assess its performance and manage risks throughout the entire life cycle through the detection, assessment, mitigation and monitoring of risks with the definition and management of appropriate contingencies, in order to protect the financial margins of the projects themselves. Risk management is supported by dedicated Risk Managers in project teams. The Group is committed to the continuous improvement of its industrial efficiency and its ability to meet customer specifications. With reference to energy commodities, the Group pursues, on an ongoing basis, a strategy aimed at optimising purchases and uses of resources.

The risks of performance of contracts, associated with the liability to customers or third parties, also depend on the supply and sub-supply chain. 
The Group purchases, in very substantial proportions with respect to its sales, industrial products and services, materials and components, equipment and subsystems; it may therefore incur liability to its customers for operational, legal or financial risks attributable to third parties, who operate as suppliers or sub-suppliers. The Group’s dependence on suppliers for certain business activities might give rise to difficulties in maintaining quality standards and meeting delivery times. The risk profile of suppliers can deteriorate during downturns in economy, in the presence of geopolitical tensions and conflicts and during periods of convulsive recovery, also due to subsequent offer shortages and. 
Leonardo has been pursuing its policy of strengthening and improving the supply chain for some years, leveraging a transparent and sustainable partnership relationship with the excellences in its Supply Chain, to give rise to a more innovative, integrated and resilient industrial eco-system. In addition to the programmes already in place (LEAP, ELITE Leonardo Lounge), the Company has defined a set of principles and rules for the assessment of key suppliers, specifically oriented towards the development and growth of the Supply Chain with a view to long-term sustainability

(Leonardo Assessment and Development for Sustainability).

The Group is required to fulfil direct or indirect offset obligations in certain countries. 
In the Aerospace and Defence sector, some international institutional customers require the application of some types of industrial offset related to the award of contracts, sometimes with rigorous requirements, linked to the development policy of each country. Therefore, the Group may undertake offset obligations that require procurement or manufacturing support at local level, technology transfer and investments in industrial projects in the customer’s country. Failure to meet offset obligations may result in the application of penalties and, in certain cases, might prevent the Group from participating in contract award procedures in the countries concerned.
The Group manages offset risks by means of appropriate analyses carried out from the offering phase within the project teams, which also appoint an Offset Manager for the Division concerned. A due diligence is performed before dealing with a third party under an offset agreement, which is conducted according to the relevant international best practices.
Leonardo has also set up a dedicated central organisational unit to guide and supervise offset activities.

Critical raw materials available on the market. 
Critical raw materials are of great importance for industrial applications, especially for high-tech applications and, in particular, for components (sensors, actuators, highly miniaturised microprocessors). In some cases, critical raw materials are a decisive enabler for both the initiatives underpinning the European Green Deal and the technologies of certain production sectors. Most of the critical raw materials relevant to the Aerospace and Defence sector are not directly available in Europe, but rather in other mainly non-NATO/EU countries. Availability and production of materials are sometimes concentrated in a single country, which may therefore be in a position to sway the balance between global supply and demand, with impacts on market prices and/or availability of goods, in particular in scenarios marked by critical geopolitical issues, the deterioration of institutional and commercial relations between sovereign states or the occurrence of war conflicts.
Leonardo, in addition to monitoring the prospective requirements of its supplies, takes part in international working groups, such as those at European and NATO level, which reconcile the interests of both States (supporting the definition of recommendations for member States) and the companies and supply chains involved, in order to encourage the identification of common strategies for mitigating risks. Leonardo also engages in activities having the purpose of enhancing the efficiency of the use of resources (for example fostering circularity mechanisms) as soon as the product technological research and sustainable design phases start.

A substantial amount of consolidated assets is attributable to intangible assets, goodwill in particular. 
The recoverability of amounts recognised in intangible assets (including goodwill and development costs) is linked to the implementation of future plans and the business plans for the relevant products.
The Group implements a policy of monitoring and limiting amounts capitalised under intangible assets, with specific regard to development costs, and carries out ongoing monitoring of performance under scheduled plans, taking any necessary corrective action in the event of unfavourable trends. These updates are reflected in impairment tests.

The Group’s debt could have an impact on its strategies. 
The debt level, beside impacting the profitability as an effect of the related borrowing costs, could affect the Group’s strategy, limiting its operational flexibility.
In assuring a solid and balanced structure between sources of funds and investments, Leonardo pursues an ongoing strategy of limiting its debt by paying steady attention to

Potential future liquidity crises could also restrict the Group’s ability to repay its debts.
cash generation, which is used, market conditions permitting, to partially reduce the existing debt.

The Group’s credit rating is also linked to the opinions of the credit rating agencies. 
All Group bond issues are given a medium-term financial credit rating by the international agencies Moody’s Investors Service, Standard and Poor’s and Fitch Ratings. A possible downgrade in the Group’s credit rating could severely limit its access to funding sources, as well as increase its borrowing costs for existing and future loans, which would have a negative impact on the business prospects, performance and financial results. Prospectively, eligibility and sustainability performance will also become increasingly important in determining creditworthiness.
The Group is actively engaged in reducing its debt as confirmed by the Industrial Plan. The Group’s financial policies and selection of investments and contracts involve being constantly alert to maintaining a balanced financial structure.
In seeking out strategies to pursue, the Group always takes into account the potential impact on the indicators used by the credit rating agencies.
At the same time, the Group is committed to the ongoing optimisation of its sustainability profile, as well as contributing to the relevant initiatives of the European Aerospace and Defense Industry.

The Group realises part of its revenues in currencies other than those in which costs are incurred, exposing it to the risk of exchangerate fluctuations. A part of consolidated assets is denominated in US dollars and pound sterling. 
The Group reports a significant portion of revenues and costs in currencies other than euro (mainly in dollars and pounds). Accordingly, any negative changes in the reference exchange rate might have negative effects (transaction risk).
Moreover, the Group has made significant investments in the United Kingdom, in Poland and in the United States of America: this might have a negative impact on the Group’s results of operations, financial position and cash flows due to the translation of the financial statements of foreign investees (translation risk).
The Group continuously applies an organised systematic hedge policy to combat transaction risk for all contracts in its portfolio by using the financial instruments available on the market.
Moreover, in intercompany financing activities denominated in currencies other than the euro individual positions are hedged at the central level.

The Group is a sponsor of definedbenefit pension plans in the UK and the US and of other minor plans in Europe. 
Under the pension schemes reserved for employees who mainly operate in the United Kingdom and in the United States of America, the Group is required to ensure a specific future retirement benefit level for employees participating in the plan. In said countries the pension funds in which the Group participates invest resources in the plan assets (stocks, bonds, etc.) that might not be sufficient to cover the agreed-upon benefits. If the value of plan assets is less than the agreed-upon benefit level, the Group duly recognises the amount of the deficit among liabilities, with consequent adverse effects on its financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
The Group monitors pension funds’ investment plans and strategies on an ongoing basis and takes immediate deficit corrective action when necessary.

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT. 
Continuous dialogue with companies, political and economic institutions, the scientific world, the younger generations, local communities and other relevant stakeholders is at the heart of Leonardo's approach, aimed at strengthening the ability to create shared value. In this manner, the Group nurtures stable and longlasting relationships over time, based on integrity, transparency and compliance with rules. In order to maintain effective dialogue with all stakeholders, starting with its employees, Leonardo regularly involves them through its organisational units and the most effective methods, in order to understand their interests and points of view. All opportunities for stakeholder engagement – from Shareholders’ Meetings to trade association meetings, from collaborations within the scope of technology R&D programmes to support projects at local level and digital events - contribute to strengthening its bond with the industrial, economic and social context and to improving its business management practices.
Main dialogue activities with stakeholders. 

Reputational risk analysis The analysis of more than 15,000 articles in the general and specialist press of 40 countries in 202134 (about +12% compared to 2020, with a greater presence of German, Austrian, Indian and Japanese press) confirms a favourable image of Leonardo in both Italian and international media, respectively equal to 67.2% and 71.8%, in continuity compared to the previous year. The favourable perception is determined, specifically, by the recognition of the Company's role as a key sustainable, technology player in the AD&S sector, with particular attention to innovation and digitisation. This favourable perception has not been affected by the effects of the pandemic on civil aviation in the business segment of Aerostructures. Neutral sentiment rose to 25.8% in Italian media (23.4% in 2020) and 27.9% in international media (25.8% in 2020).

WELL-BEING, INCLUSION AND EMPLOYMENT PROTECTION. 
Leonardo employs 50,413 people, 97% of whom are located in Italy, the United Kingdom, the United States and Poland. This human capital is mainly composed of staff with a STEM qualification, characterized by a generational diversity that fosters the exchange of experiences and skills.
Employees worlwide. 
Diversity is for Leonardo a distinctive factor of competitiveness, talent attraction, human capital enhancement and innovation, which is key to the Group’s sustainable growth. The context and working environment, which is more and more interconnected and collaborative, have in fact a strong influence on individual behaviour, generating trust and increasing the involvement of employees, with a direct impact on customers, profits and productivity. In order to support people in reaching their potential, Leonardo manages diversity and inclusion (D&I) as part of the Company's change management processes, with a data-driven approach to reduce the risk of subjective assessments and unconscious biases. In particular, in line with sustainability objectives, which have been strengthened on the matter of gender equality - and the actions envisaged in the Sustainability Plan, four main types of projects have been launched and are currently in progress, aimed at different targets and involving all levels of the organisation: > Mentorship and Coaching - programmes aimed at supporting women and their professional growth; > Inclusive Culture - training aimed at countering prejudice and cognitive distortions, in addition to a selection of courses offered to employees on the Coursera platform dedicated to gender inclusion; > Strong Leadership (Springboard) - international programme aimed at strengthening female leadership; > Role Model STEM - inspirational talks held by Leonardo’s female employees who work or have a STEM background, aimed at new generations.
Leonardo promotes the D&I culture, including through internal and external initiatives that take place during the year and new models of work organisation that promote work-life balance.

Baseline 2018. 
In 2021 Leonardo continued its work on the initiatives and solutions that had been started in 2020 regarding the management of the pandemic. In particular, it ensured operations of its production lines, including thanks to the gradual improvement of the pandemic situation, and the protocols and crisis units were confirmed to safeguard the health and safety of employees.
Moreover, the company supplementary agreement (for middle managers, white collars and blue collars) and the second-level agreement for managers were renewed in 2021.
Early retirement - Leonardo and the national Italian trade unions signed an early retirement agreement under art. 4 of Law 92/2012 - Fornero Act -, which affects the four Plants of the Aerostructures Division. The agreement will involve a number of up to a maximum of 500 employees for whom rights will accrue for retirement in a maximum timeframe of seven years following the planned exits in the three-year period from 2021 to 2023 or workers for whom rights will accrue for early retirement under the Quota 100 scheme in 2021.
Welfare and Flexible benefits – Leonardo provides employees and their families with grants for the purchase of textbooks, passes for public services, furniture and accessories for working from home, in addition to full or partial reimbursement services for various types of educational, social security and welfare and transport costs. Leonardo’s company recreational clubs also provide employees and their families with leisure, recreational and cultural activities. In the United Kingdom, it has also implemented a programme (Go Green Car Scheme), which provides tax and insurance benefits to employees who purchase an electric or low-emission car, in line with its commitment to energy transition. Flexible benefits worth over €mil. 10 were paid out in Italy and the United Kingdom in 2021.
Parenting – Leonardo pays out grants for nurseries, scholarships and (in some territories) summer camps for employees' children. Furthermore, leave from work and more protective forms of childcare flexibility are granted for both parents.
Flexible working – Under the Custom working programme, Leonardo has changed, in the United Kingdom, the way work is carried out, giving employees, together with their managers, team and customers, the opportunity to decide where and when to work. This flexibility allows the focus to be maintained on customer needs, while better reconciling employee work requirements with personal and family life. Leave policies also allow employees to volunteer in addition to annual vacations.

Upskilling of blue collar workers - As from December 2021, about 25 workers with STEM degrees (most of them coming from the Grottaglie site) were selected and trained to be placed in the Engineering area of the Division through an appropriate two-month training course.
 

 

Local schemes for mandatory placement - Since the early stages after lockdown, various employee protection schemes were put in place in order to cope with reduced workloads. From July 2020 to early 2022, about 170 staff members were transferred from the most affected businesses to the Aircraft, Electronics and Helicopter Divisions.

Vacation and permits Solidarity Fund – This fund has been created to support employees who have used up all of their vacation days and permits to cover health emergency-related absences: it was set up by the company in 2020 and renewed in 2021, including thanks to donations of untaken holidays on the part of the Group’s employees, on a voluntary basis. The Fund has been also used to support "fragile" categories and parents with school-age children.
New Skills Fund – In response to the technological and competitive development needs of the sites of Leonardo Aerostructures division, which have been made even more urgent by the changed conditions of the aeronautics market, Leonardo has implemented and completed a major upskilling plan financed by the New Skills Fund, with the aim of spreading and strengthening expertise on processes necessary to support and relaunch the Division's products and, in particular: increasing adaptability, responsiveness to change and technological and organisational innovation, spreading the culture of innovation of both product and process, improving performance, cost competitiveness, sustainability and the ability to innovate.
23 training courses have been launched, which are calibrated to meet manufacturing needs and all of which have been delivered via distance learning.
The course has involved 3,169 participants for a total of over 418,000 hours of training. Factory operators have been provided with dedicated electronic devices and the methods to plan, use and strengthen technical and specialist courses have been profoundly changed, involving about 500 expert teachers.

Smart working survey 2021 – In 2021 Leonardo launched a People Survey to engage employees working in Italy in a reflection on the possible organisation of work after the pandemic and to set up working models that are increasingly suited to the different environments of the Group, capable of reconciling the needs of business with those of people. The Survey, which was online and anonymous, involved over 19,000 employees, with an attendance rate of 68%. The results showed that employees went to work on an ongoing basis, despite the emergency: more than 67% said they worked in presence 2 or more days a week. About 50% of Leonardo’s employees would like to work remotely 1 or 2 days a week in the future, a working method that has been found to have a positive impact on productivity, people's psychological and emotional well-being and on their propensity to innovate. 89% of employees say in fact that it could be applied effectively within their work teams and 88% that it would enable them to achieve long-term company objectives. In 2022 Leonardo will launch specific training courses targeted at all employees working remotely to make this new method increasingly effective.
Employee engagement – In the United Kingdom Leonardo has conducted various surveys to measure employee engagement, develop people and improve business results. Each manager has received the results from their team and plans have been developed in response to the areas identified for improvement, on a "You said, we did" model. Through focus groups, managers who have achieved the highest scores on the survey have shared their experience with others in order to spread the most successful models.
Sustain-Able – This is a co-innovation project implemented with the start-up Up2you to raise awareness and promote responsible behaviour through the use of gamification. People are involved in low environmental impact challenges and stimulated on sustainability issues through the Sustain-Able platform. The first phase of the project has involved around 3,400 employees.
#ValoreD4STEM survey – This has been the first STEM-related research conducted in Italy on 61 companies. The survey, which was conducted by the Valore D association of which the Company is a member, has allowed Leonardo to draw an identikit of female workers with an education or professional role in the STEM area. 980 employees from Leonardo have taken in the survey, out of a total sample of over 5,000.

Leonardo directs D&I promotion initiatives by taking account of the geographical characteristics of the countries in which it operates. In 2020 the Joint Committee was set up in Italy, which is composed of company and union representatives, with the aim of analysing, promoting and sharing company. 
Springboard Programme – 50 women have been involved in the first edition of the international programme to strengthen female leadership, with another 100 to be involved in 2022.

Report on operations at 31 December 2021 initiatives and projects for equal opportunities and diversity, as was a cross-functional working group for setting targets to 2030 and preparing a 2021 Action Plan for the promotion of gender equality. In the United Kingdom, there is a People and Inclusion committee and a new monthly forum was introduced in 2021 where Senior Leaders share proposals to support the inclusion of underrepresented groups at Leonardo and the management of professional growth. In the United States, a Diversity Advisory Group (DAG) and a DAG Team promote D&I culture to support the company’s organisational climate, talent management, recruiting and engagement initiatives.
Inclusive recruitment – In 2021, recruitment managers in the United Kingdom received dedicated training to mitigate any bias in selection processes, achieving during the year the best gender balance on new hires that Leonardo has ever achieved in the country. In order to maintain the trend in 2022 too, Leonardo is committed to promoting open positions to involve more female candidates. Leonardo UK has also been the first company in the industry to join the Association for Black and Minority Ethnic Engineers UK to attract, develop and retain engineers representing ethnic minorities. In Italy too, as part of the most prestigious recruiting appointments, events and Career Days of the best Italian Universities Leonardo has promoted a distinctive identity that is increasingly based on the values of D&I and promoted the inclusion of women in the company, particularly with specific technical and scientific skills. In the United States Leonardo carries out targeted activities for schools and universities with a high presence of AfricanAmerican students (Historically Black Colleges & Universities - HBCUs).
STEM Returners – In the United Kingdom Leonardo has launched the first edition of the programme to attract individuals with STEM background, in particular engineers, who have left the labour market for reasons related to personal or family life and provide them with career opportunities.
Network Group – Five Employee networks have been established in the United Kingdom to raise awareness and promote D&I strategy and make Leonardo an inclusive working environment for all employees: Pride (LGBTQ+), to provide advice and promote awareness of LGBTQ issues in the workplace; Equalise to offer support to employees on gender equality; Carers to support employees with special care needs such as for elderly parents, partners or children; Enable focused on neurodiversity and disability; Ethnicity, to support ethnic inclusion in association with AFBE-UK. Wellbeing, to promote the fundamentals of personal and organisational well-being, will also be introduced in 2022.
Imposter Syndrome - Training has been delivered on Imposter Syndrome, which is associated with low levels of self-esteem and feelings of low personal worth and inadequacy, which has involved over 300 employees at cross-border level.
Disability – In the United Kingdom Leonardo has developed a programme to support people with disabilities from the selection and onboarding phase through to hiring and growth in the company. Training courses are delivered for recruiters and partnerships with third-party organisations that specialise in attracting and managing candidates with disabilities and autism. Leonardo is also working to remove architectural barriers by improving access to the sites in the United Kingdom.
Gender reassignment and transition – In 2021, Leonardo included gender reassignment in the United Kingdom as one of the reasons an employee is entitled to request special leave.

ENHANCEMENT OF PEOPLE AND SKILLS. 
Leonardo's industrial strategy aims to attract and manage the job profiles and skills needed to meet the new challenges posed by the market, including the risk of their obsolescence. The company’s skill management and enhancement schemes support people throughout their career in the company, stimulating lifelong learning and activating upskilling and reskilling processes. The use of innovative technology tools in the various areas of people management and development is a key factor for change and radical improvement in the Group's overall performance. In particular, the most recent initiatives for the development of new skills aim to align the competencies of our human resources with the needs of the future, design training programmes and reduce outsourcing and recourse to the market, leveraging a digital approach that combines data mining, artificial intelligence and Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) training platforms.
62% of employees hold a STEM qualification 
54% of new hires hold a STEM qualification. 
About 1.6 million hours of training delivered 776 training courses activated with the educational system36. 
Data 2021. 
Leonardo takes part in strategic initiatives focused on skill development at a European level too. Among these are the ASSETs + (Alliance for Strategic Skills addressing Emerging Technologies in Defence) project, which was launched in 2020 and involves about 30 European partners (industrial, academic, etc.); the project aims to create a system of observation and management of critical skills for Defence and a mechanism through which Universities can bridge the gap of misalignment on identified skills through new pedagogical approaches and training courses. 172 skills were identified and analysed in three domains (Artificial Intelligence, Cybersecurity, C4ISTAR - Command, Control, Communications, Computers,
Information/Intelligence, Surveillance, Targeting Acquisition and Reconnaissance), classified into three categories: technical expertise; skills related to methodologies and procedures needed to develop certain Defense application areas; cross-sector skills, which are soft skills needed in all business sectors.
Leonardo has also adhered to the Pact For Skills, which is one of the 12 actions required to implement the Skills Agenda for Europe. The purpose of the programme is to mobilize stakeholders involved in the target sectors in order to create better upskilling and reskilling opportunities for students and workers in Europe, sharing specific commitments. This Pact will also help foster the transition to digital and automation, accelerate post-Covid recovery and increase the competitiveness in our continent. A working group dedicated to skills in the AeroSpace and Defence Industries Association of Europe (ASD) sector has been formed to provide further support within the sector. Leonardo also participates in the Jobs, Skills & Impact Working Group of the European Round Table (ERT), which is mainly focused on reskilling and upskilling programmes, needed to address digital and green transitions that are underway37.

Performance appraisal – In 2021, around 30,000 people were involved in the performance assessment, 22% of whom were women. The first phase of the "Performance & Development Management for IPT" pilot project was also implemented with the assignment of IPT (Integrated Project Team) performance objectives to resources working in project teams.
People analytics – Analysis and data mining tools have been adopted to identify and develop new skills, map the job profiles present in its organisation and monitor the evolution and trends of the market, as well as the activities of its main competitors. The fact of identifying in advance any emerging role or roles affected by significant changes does in fact allow the company to take actions for the recruitment of new profiles or training of resources in order to acquire or strengthen specific skills in a targeted manner, including with a view to up/reskilling. On the basis of the analyses carried out, the use of the Coursera platform also makes it possible to select the best courses or the most suitable certifications. Specifically, in-depth analyses of seven strategically important technologies have been conducted through this rationale, defining assumptions for the development of the necessary roles and training required on impacted populations, supported by the Love for Learning project.
Succession plans – About 1,400 people, up to the third organisational level, have been involved in the people review process between succession candidates and Future Leaders. These resources constitute Leonardo’s Leadership Pipeline, for which the Company aims to ensure, in an increasingly effective manner, full professional fulfilment in line with development expectations and skills they possess, enabling generational change and gender diversity. Women account for 23% of the total group.

Virtual recruitment – In 2021 Leonardo participated in 9 digital appointments in which over 9,000 young people explored the virtual stands and interacted with company representatives through webinars, one-to-one chats and video interviews, while collecting approximately 3,000 CVs. Leonardo also experimented with Virtual Assessments, involving new graduates in various virtual tests, including the innovative Digital Escape Room, and implemented the Tutored platform, a new employer branding and recruiting channel capable of reaching over 500,000 students and graduates coming from over 100 Italian universities and Business Schools.
Love for Learning – Leonardo is the only Italian company that has made the training offer of Coursera, the world's leading platform for MOOCs available to all of its employees around the world. Approximately 4,500 courses, which are produced by the best universities in the world, are accessible from home and office. Participants can earn certifications for the courses taken, thus improving their level of employability. The effectiveness of the programme is confirmed by the growing number of those enrolled, over 8,900, with 28,800 courses started and 156,200 hours of training used. In particular, 24% of the courses taken were in Data Science and 19% in Computer Science. In order to make the training experience even more targeted, training courses were planned for professional roles in the Engineering area, particularly exposed to the danger of professional obsolescence.
Upgrading YOU – This is a high-level managerial training course that has involved 119 new executives in four editions, with over 6,700 hours of training, to support the exercise of leadership, promote team building, networking and customer experience, and the testing of innovative solutions.
Behaviour simulator – Leonardo has implemented for the first time a Digital Role Play platform based on Artificial Intelligence, which offers the possibility of practicing critical managerial conversations in a simulated environment and reflecting on the impact of one's own behaviours. It is an innovative tool to deliver training in the management of critical conversations and develop cross-sector skills, such as managing feedback, delegating a task in an effective manner, leading towards change, resolving conflicts and enhancing diversity in one's team. Approximately 250 employees have been involved across Italy and the United Kingdom, generating over 2,500 Digital Role Play sessions and 800 hours of training on the platform.
Internal mobility - 32% of positions filled with internal candidates, including through the use of job posting.
Sustainability Training - Leonardo has prepared for the first time a mandatory course dedicated to sustainability, targeted at employees in Italy. It is planned to extend the course to the Group's other locations.

Change management models in the business. 
Leonardo Production System (LPS) It is the agile production system inspired by the World Class Manufacturing (WCM) method, by which Leonardo pursues the objective of optimising efficiency and productivity through an approach oriented to continuous improvement in the management of processes and programs, which is capable of ensuring more and more quality and safety. People are stimulated to make the best use of their experience in order to adopt good practices that are already in place and, above all, to take improvement actions in the work areas, with reference to ten technical pillars. The driving force behind the programme is the continuous learning on the part of Pillar Leaders, aimed at strengthening the skills to be passed on to the various teams in the field, on the one hand, and, on the other, training courses dedicated to plant managers so that they can facilitate the adoption of the methodology, through a system-wide knowledge of the WCM. In particular, Pillar Leaders focused on the people development Pillar have the key task of mapping the skills possessed by teams of engineers and operators and selecting those to be acquired or strengthened. In order to accelerate and support continuous improvement processes, LPS also leverages digital transformation (LPS Digital), through the adoption of tools that facilitate the collection of data and its use in process management, the implementation of new digital platforms and ongoing monitoring of Industry 4.0 technologies on the market.
LPS is managed by a governance and control system set up by the WCM Association at international level, based on standardised evaluation criteria for each technical pillar. Each facility operated under the LPS model is audited every six months by a team of WCM-certified company or third-party auditors. The main objective of the audits is to ensure that the application of the different pillars contributes to risk reduction (safety), process improvement (quality), energy efficiency and better plant management.
From the launch of the program from the beginning of 2019 to the end of 2021, LPS involved 16 manufacturing plants in Italy and made it possible injuries to be reduced in the areas of intervention by about 95%, as well as to increase productivity on average by about 30% and reduce the cost of "non-quality". Among the actions taken, LPS also made it possible to intervene on ergonomic improvements of the workstation, with benefits in terms of productivity, effectiveness, quality and well-being of operators.
Over 2,000 people involved in 16 manufacturing plants. 
More than 1,900 projects for continuous improvement (kaizen) -95% of injuries in the areas of intervention of the LPS +30% of productivity in the model areas of the plants that have implemented the LPS. 
MOVE: Mindset, Objectives, Vision for the Enhancement This programme, which is dedicated to the professional family of Customer Support, Services and Training (CSS&T), MOVE (Mindset, Objectives, Vision for the Enhancement), consists of virtual learning oriented to the development of a digital mindset and vertical skills aimed at supporting the servitization process at Leonardo, focusing on Customer Satisfaction. The programme, which is now in its second edition, is structured into modules and aims to develop personal and professional growth, encouraging critical thinking and greater awareness to achieve successful results in customer service. About 400 people have been involved since 2020, while also extending the course from 2021 to other areas that contribute directly to the development of Customer Satisfaction.
Future Factory Future Factory is a change programme that Leonardo is implementing in the United Kingdom to drive the evolution of the business towards state-of-the-art operating systems and ways of working, enabling people to contribute more effectively to the achievement of strategic objectives. The program is built around four main projects for gradual performance improvement: Integrated Planning, Digital engineering, Supply chain transformation and Digital factory.

These three areas, which are presented in the Group’s Policy on Human Rights, were identified by means of a specific analysis performed between 2017 and 2018 based on the ISO 26000 guidelines: it identified the Group’s business areas that are potentially exposed to the risk of violations of human rights and the measures put in place to manage and mitigate risks. In order to identify and promptly manage potential risks and negative impacts on human rights, Leonardo has mechanisms in place for the management of reports, either signed or anonymous, and has set up a dedicated communication channel40. In order to strengthen the surveillance system, the Group promotes the protection of human rights along the value chain, supporting its dissemination among its stakeholders, including though the action under the Sustainability Plan and by participating in multilateral initiatives to create synergies between associations, businesses and institutions. For example, Leonardo, as LEAD Company of the UN Global Compact, has been participating since 2019 in the Action Platform on SDG 16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions41.

Human Rights Impact Assessment. 
In the application of the Group's Policy on respect for human rights and in line with the objectives of the Sustainability Plan, an analysis tool (Human Rights Risk Assessment - HRIA) has been adopted with the aim of setting out the main risk indices with reference to human rights and the potential impact of the activities carried out by the Company. In particular, this analysis is carried out "by country" and "by transaction".
> Analysis “by country” – While setting out five red flags, the analysis tool aims to identify countries which, despite the absence of specific sanction programmes, have been reported by national and international bodies (e.g. UN and EU) due to violations of human rights, with particular reference to: serious acts of internal repression, violations of international humanitarian law; belonging to conflict zones in the trade of "3TG" minerals (so-called conflict minerals). On the basis of these assessments, the countries to be included in the list of Sensitive Countries for reasons linked to the respect for human rights are identified, establishing the obligation to notify any transaction involving them, either directly or indirectly.
> Analysis “by transaction” – The risk analysis tool relating to transactions with Sensitive Countries has been completed with the addition of two drivers relating to the respect for human rights that are linked to the HRIA "by country".
This new analysis tool went into effect with the issuance of the new Trade Compliance Guideline and Directive issued in December 2021. The new Directive was issued one year in advance of the specific sustainability target.

NATURAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT IN INDUSTRIAL PROCESSES. 
Among the principles behind the Group's environmental management model45 are the responsible and sustainable development of its activities, the application of health, safety and environmental management standards, the attention to the needs and expectations of its stakeholders, excellence in services and continuous improvement in its performance. In line with these principles, Leonardo is committed to the efficient use of energy and natural resources, as well as to an effective risk management to protect the health and safety of people and a reduction in emissions and pollution, operating in compliance with applicable laws, voluntary standards and stakeholder expectations.
Leonardo has extended the voluntary adoption of certified management systems and dedicates resources to training and raising awareness of people, in addition to engagement programmes and internal and external communication tools that promote behaviours based on sustainability, health and safety among employees, partners and suppliers. Audit programmes, risk identification and management processes in the areas of environment, health and safety and any related mitigation plans make it possible to ensure a safe working environment, as well as check for regulatory compliance, maintain site management system certifications, certify emission allowances, and assess the correct application of monitoring, control and reporting tools to protect people, the environment and business continuity. As part of Leonardo's Sustainability Plan, energy and industrial efficiency improvement measures have been planned to reduce GHG emissions, increasing the use of electricity from renewable sources (almost 100% in Italy, the United Kingdom and Germany46), water withdrawals, waste production, the use of hazardous substances, and protect the soil and subsoil and biodiversity.

Sites subject to other authorisations (discharge, emissions into the atmosphere): 21 sites, of which 12 Italian and 9 foreign. The same site may be subject to more than one classification and related applicable regulations.
50For the definition of protected areas or areas with high biodiversity, reference should be made to the main applicable standards including Rete Natura 2000, IBA (Important Bird Area); Law 394/1991; Ramsar Areas.
Water management Water Project - The project envisages an analysis of the conditions of water networks, water treatment plants and factory water balance at most Italian sites in order to design a long-term programme of actions for improvement (both for systems and operations) to solve critical issues and implement innovative solutions, identified on the basis of inspections and indepth analyses of documentation.
Water recovery project - At the Grottaglie site, one of the Group's most water intensive plants, a project has been launched to maximise the recovery of rain and condensate water from Air Treatment Units (UTAs) through an accumulation basin. The water recovered through a reverse osmosis process will be used in the evaporative towers, achieving a reduction in drinking water withdrawals of 20% in 2022 and 35% in 2025 compared to 2020 values.
Energy resilience Energy Infrastructure Programme - The Programme has been launched to increase the reliability of power supply at Leonardo sites, in support of their business continuity. The optimisation projects relating to the Italian sites of Nola, Turin and La Spezia, carried out in 2021, are in fact aimed at improving the redundancy of the external power supply networks serving these sites.
Demand Response Programme – Leonardo makes 4.6 MWe of power available to the National Electricity Grid through the Cameri and Fucino sites. The programme, promoted by the European Commission, encourages the active participation of final consumers in the electricity system for the resolution of technical problems on the grid, avoiding the construction of new power plants.

Soil and air protection Leonardo implements various activities to reduce pollutants emitted into the atmosphere through the application of new technologies and more efficient abatement systems. These include improving management systems, eliminating or reducing diffuse and/or fugitive pollution in the atmosphere, and eliminating emission sources. These activities contribute to avoiding or completely eliminating relative emissions, including NOx, SO2 and VOC emissions. Furthermore, Leonardo is committed to promoting initiatives aimed at controlling and reducing the use of hazardous substances. Leonardo’s sites where production processes are carried out, which involve the controlled use of hazardous substances operate in line with specific regulations to manage risks and any potential impact on the environment49. The management of contaminated sites and ongoing remediation procedures in the Group, 20 in 2021, is based on an approach of responsibility and sustainability to implement the best technical and operational solutions.
 
Biodiversity protection. 
As part of responsible consumption of natural resources and environmental protection, Leonardo is committed to protecting biodiversity, putting in place the necessary measures to protect natural habitats and the variety of species present in the areas in which Leonardo operates and, in particular, in sites located within or near protected natural areas and with high biodiversity50. In 2021 these sites amounted to 40 (22 in Italy, 4 in the United Kingdom, 7 in the United States and 7 in the rest of the world). In addition, 10 sites owned in Italy are affected, within a radius of 2 km, by additional landscape constraints, including archaeological ones (buffer strips, areas of public interest, etc.). The extent in hectares of sites located within 3 km of protected natural areas and/or areas of high biodiversity is 600 hectares, equal to 50% of the surface area occupied by Leonardo Group sites. Among the recovery/protection actions implemented by the sites were reforestation, the phyto-purification of wastewater with native plants and the installation of an oil/water separator to avoid soil or water contamination.

TOWARDS ENERGY TRANSITION. 
Leonardo’s business objectives and strategy for combating climate change, as set out by taking account of short, medium and long-term risks and opportunities, regulatory requirements, global scenarios and customer needs, integrate two main perspectives, combining technological innovation and sustainability: the first one is linked to the continuous efficiency of production activities and processes, by reducing energy consumption and emissions into the atmosphere, while the second is linked to the development of products and services with lower environmental impact, even in the context of European programmes for research and innovation, and of technologies functional to monitoring and mitigating the effects linked to climate change, such as the development and use of satellite systems for Earth observation, high-performance IT systems, such as the davinci-1 supercomputer, and solutions that enable intervention in the event of natural disasters. In the management of production activities and processes (operations) Leonardo monitors and increases the eco-efficiency of its sites through specific projects, including in collaboration with third-party partners in the energy sector, the adoption and gradual extension of the ISO 14001 and ISO 50001 environmental management systems. The multi-year investment programme for energy efficiency, in line with the Group's energy policy and efficiency improvement targets, ensures the allocation of resources to projects with the best returns in technical, financial and sustainability terms.
Major projects to reduce CO2 emissions in operations (Scopes 1 and 2) 
SF6 replacement – Leonardo is proceeding with the work to upgrade its manufacturing processes in order to significantly reduce the quantities used for the inert gas SF6 by replacing it with a gas with lower Global Warming Potential (GWP), according to the methods envisaged in the relevant project of the Sustainability Plan. The objective is in fact to replace SF6 gas (GWP: 23,500) with R134a (GWP: 1,300) as the inert gas used during the casting of magnesium alloys. 2021 saw a reduction in direct emissions by more than 100,000 tons of CO2e thanks to the partial replacement of SF6 with R134a.

Energy self-production programme – The analysis has been completed for the first pilot plants of Nola, Vergiate, Decimomannu and Cisterna di Latina, for which the work on authorisation and construction of self-production plants exclusively based on PV technology (100% green) will be started during 2022. A further 10 candidate sites in Italy have also been analysed with the aim of maximising direct consumption of energy from renewable sources and increasing the share of renewable energy produced, exploiting the space available in industrial areas and limiting the exploitation of land. In fact, it is estimated that the energy self-consumed by these plants can contribute to a reduction, by 2025, in electricity consumption from the external grid amounting to over 16 GWh / a year, equal to about 5,000 tons of CO2e avoided per year. The systems hosted at Leonardo’s plants will be owned by a third-party partner who will make a portion of the energy produced available to the sites, thus helping to reduce the withdrawal of electricity from the external grid and associated costs.

Full Potential lighting programme - The first phase of Leonardo’s LED lighting programme, which was launched in 2014, has enabled the replacement of more than 12,000 lamps, for estimated annual savings in electricity consumption of 16.8 GWh when fully operational and total avoided emissions of more than 6,000 tons of CO2e, in addition to improving the quality of workplace lighting. During 2021, analyses of the new "Full Potential" Lighting Programme were completed to accelerate the replacement of lamps that are not yet LED at the other sites in Italy. These analyses made it possible to allocate around €mil. 30 of investment in the 2022-2026 plan budget, with the first projects starting operations in 2022. Under the Programme, it is expected that the plants' electricity consumption will be reduced, by 2025, by more than 23.7 GWh per year, equal to about 7,400 tons of CO2e per year avoided compared to 2019.

District heating – The project was completed to replace the internal heating system at the Turin site in the Aircraft Division, with a modern and more environmentally sustainable district heating system. The project, which must be added to the district heating system that is already in use at the Brescia, Genoa and Swidnik sites, makes it possible to avoid a direct consumption of natural gas, thus contributing to reduce emissions by around 500 tons of CO2e per year.

Digital energy monitoring - New smart meters were installed to monitor energy at Leonardo sites in 2021. The new systems, which are operational in 24 of the Group's sites, enable even more structured and digitised management of energy consumption and facilitate the identification of new projects to improve consumption efficiency. It is possible to monitor over 70% of the consumption at the Italian plants through the platform that connects around 1,100 smart meters.

Projects to reduce CO2 emissions in the supply chain (Scope 3) 
In developing products and solutions, Leonardo uses cutting-edge materials, processes and technologies that limit energy consumption and help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, thus contributing to combating climate change and reducing the use of hazardous substances. Leonardo produces in fact aircraft that consume less fossil fuels through the use of lighter materials and have lower energy requirements, virtual training systems that drastically reduce real flight hours and systems to optimise air, urban and maritime traffic, which make the aeronautics and transport sectors more environmentally sustainable. Leonardo's approach in the aeronautics sector supports the objectives of Destination205051, the major sustainability project in the aviation sector in Europe, which sets out a roadmap for net zero-emission air transport by 2050, acting on all flights relating to Europe, the United Kingdom and the European Free Trade Association, through the collaboration of airlines, airports, Aerospace companies and navigation service providers.

Destination 2050 Objectives 
-37% of CO2 emissions, improving aviation technology 
-34% of CO2 emissions through the use of SAFs 
-8% of CO2 emissions implementing financial measures 

-6% of CO2 emissions, improving management of air traffic and of aircraft operations. 
Leonardo also participates in the research and development of advanced solutions with low environmental impact promoted by major national and European projects, benefiting from both risk sharing and reduced research costs and time to market, including: Clean Sky 2 and Sesar 2020, within the Horizon 2020 programme, and their successors Sesar 3 and Clean Aviation52. As regards the advocacy on issues relating to energy transition and environmental protection, Leonardo is a member of the International Aerospace and Environment Group (IAEG), an organisation including the industry's leading companies committed to advancing innovative environmental solutions and standards for aerospace. Among the topics dealt with are hazardous substance management, alternative technology development, and GHG emissions reporting and

Electric and hybrid cars – 37% of Leonardo’s (long-term) leased corporate fleet consists of hybrid/electric drive vehicles, with the goal of achieving 80% by 2023. Regarding the carpool, currently 55% is made up of “green” vehicles. In support of this objective, additional charging towers will be installed at all Leonardo sites, in addition to the 67 that are currently in use at 21 facilities. A car sharing pilot project has also been launched at some sites, using only electric or hybrid cars, with the aim of gradually extending it to the entire Group.

Sustainable employee mobility – Home to work travel plans have been prepared for 38 company sites in Italy, 10 of which on a voluntary basis. Approximately 29,000 staff members of Leonardo work at such sites, equal to about 94% of the Company's population in Italy. The Plans include more than 230 projects to be implemented; in 2021, expenses of about €mil. 3 were incurred for sustainable mobility projects in favour of the Company's people, including, for example, maintaining the shuttle service at numerous company sites, installing covered parking spaces for bicycles and kick scooters, and providing grants for the purchase of public transport season tickets.

In order to provide further support within the sector, a working group has been formed, which is dedicated to expertise in the AeroSpace and Defence Industries Association of Europe (ASD). Leonardo also participates in the Energy Transition and Climate Change group of the European Round Table (ERT), and in the related thematic task forces, mainly focusing on issues of mitigation and adaptation to climate change and the impact of new technologies to accelerate the digital and green transitions underway.
Major projects to reduce CO2 emissions in the aeronautics and helicopter business. 

Virtualisation – Embedded Training Systems allow online training with real and/or virtual actors in a tactical scenario shared between aircraft, ground simulators and monitoring and control stations, with real-time data exchange through data link (aircraft-to-ground) and communication networks (ground-to-ground). These technologies make it possible to significantly reduce the need for flights on real platforms, with consequent energy consumption and production of climate altering emissions. The virtualisation of product testing (Certification-by-Simulation) will also drastically reduce, if not completely eliminate, the flight activities required to obtain certifications for platforms and/or their subsystems. The current real tests (on the ground or in flight) may in fact take place in digital form by using advanced simulation systems and accurate models.

CO2e emissions produced with one hour of simulator compared to one hour of real flight. 
Electric or Hybrid Platforms - The development of electric or hybrid platforms will allow the reduction of CO2e emissions, up to potentially being zeroed, thanks to new propulsion systems that operate much more efficiently than current ones and without the use of fossil fuels.

Composite materials – The use of carbon fiber for aerostructures manufactured by Leonardo reduces fuel consumption by 10-15% and emissions by 20% compared to those made of metallic materials, as well as increase operational efficiency and the useful life of aircraft. In the Joint Lab with Solvay, Leonardo is collaborating in the development of thermoplastic matrix materials, which make it possible to reduce aircraft weight and therefore fuel consumption. The new material does not require the use of an autoclave for the manufacturing of large, complex structures and the consolidation of parts, thus further reducing energy consumption in the production line.
-20% of CO2e emissions with the use of carbon fiber for aerostructures. 
Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) – Environmentally sustainable fuel is one of the solutions to contribute to reducing aviation's carbon footprint at global level. At present, Leonardo has 12 helicopter models that can operate on fuels with up to 50% of SAF53.
Up to -80% of CO2 emissions over the entire life cycle thanks to the use of SAF with respect to traditional fuels54. 
Emission Trading Scheme - In Italy, 9 sites fall within the scope of the ETS (Emission Trading Scheme) regulations, compared to 12 sites in 2013, and must therefore offset their CO2e emissions by acquiring allowances partly free of charge, and partly for valuable consideration. No site of Leonardo falls within the scope of application of the Aviation ETS regulations.
 
Air traffic management – Air Traffic Management (ATM) systems help optimise traffic and reduce aircraft GHG emissions. Leonardo develops and produces ATM systems within the European SESAR (Single European Air Sky ATM Research) programme, based on paradigms of sustainability, digitisation and green transformation to create a single European air traffic control system, which at present is still fragmented.

TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION. 
In order to achieve increasingly challenging objectives that allow continuous improvement of product competitiveness, in a perspective of long-term sustainable development, Leonardo has built an integrated innovation ecosystem to intercept nascent technological innovation oriented towards an efficient crossfertilisation between different business sectors. This ecosystem actively supports the two internal innovation engines: the engineering and R&D areas of the Group's Divisions and Companies, and Leonardo Labs, which are the central laboratories set up in 2020 with the aim of anticipating technological innovation by integrating long-term technological research and supporting the Company in introducing emerging and sustainable technology into products and services. Leonardo’s innovation system is powered by key tools such as: open innovation, with its many channels of listening and discussion to capture new contaminations, contests on new and topical issues, networking with Universities and Research Centers, Innovation Communities, internal working groups established with the objective of accelerating innovation culture by sharing best practices and skills, and the Intellectual Property (IP) Office for the management and maintenance of the portfolio of patents and brands.
Numbers of innovation. 
Leonardo Labs Leonardo Labs are the technology incubators conceived to support the Group in long-term research and development of the most innovative technologies, especially in the digital field, and transversal competencies across the company's business areas. The laboratories are focused on 8 research areas: Artificial Intelligence (AI), Digital Twin and Advanced Simulation, Big Data, High Performance Computing (HPC) and Cloud, Quantum Technologies, Autonomous and Robotic Systems, Electrification and New Materials.
These new facilities - some set up in collaboration with industrial partners and research centres that are world leaders in their respective fields of expertise - are built close to Leonardo's main industrial sites with the aim of also facilitating technology transfer and maximising the benefits to the relevant territories, strengthening collaboration with local institutions. The labs will thus be fertilizers for local areas while allowing Leonardo to centralise the development of frontier technologies.

Report on operations at 31 December 2021. 
The Labs also make it possible to feed a continuous flow of talent and to ensure flexibility and renewal, both in terms of skills and professional competencies: Leonardo’s researchers coming from all over the world, who are part of the Labs network, in fact work together with experts and researchers within the Group Divisions. From June 2020 Leonardo has been selecting young researchers and PhD students through an international call for recruitment, and industrial PhD fellowships with 15 universities, funded by the Company, thus establishing a network of collaborating with universities to coordinate research and prepare new researchers. Leonardo Labs are based on an integrated innovation approach in which all technology research areas are interconnected and interact synergistically to address the multi-disciplinary nature typical of the Group's application areas. The davinci-1 is at the base of this model, with its computing and storage capabilities that are exploited by AI, Big Data, HPC and Cloud technologies, used by all the research areas of the higher levels. The third tier consists of application technologies that are independent research areas and use all the underlying technology and infrastructure layers. For example, the AI, Big Data, HPC technology domains converge in the implementation of the Digital Twin platform.
Technology research areas 
davinci-1 The davinci-1 supercomputer, one of the most powerful supercomputers in Aerospace, Defense and Security, is Leonardo’s answer to accelerate technological transformation towards industry digitisation. The architecture of the davinci-1 High Performance Computing (HPC) is an integrated supercomputing and cloud computing platform, which combines flexibility and computing power, thus allowing the training of algorithms (from deep learning to Artificial Intelligence), customisation by technology platform and the calculation of numerous interactions between the data that are generated (data analysis and big data). In 2021 there was the completion of testing and setup of davinci-1, which is now available to Leonardo Labs ando to Leonardo researchers and engineers to leverage its computing power and storage space for research, numerical simulation, big data analytics and Artificial Intelligence activities. Artificial Intelligence Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an essential technology in many domains and it is important to study it in order to seize new opportunities to be applied to Leonardo's products and services. This research area is dedicated to the study of new AI models and analysis techniques to monitor critical infrastructures, through the analysis of data derived from satellites and field sensors (audio, video, IoT), for security applications, using images, video streams, audio, and for command and control applications based on the integration of data from advanced sensors, decision support systems adaptable to various operational environments. A particular research focus is on techniques and methodologies to make networks and models certifiable and robust. In 2021, networks were developed for human action recognition, the classification of multi-spectral data, cyber threat recognition, topic classification, and information extraction from documents and decision support systems.

Big Data In a fast-paced world where a huge amount of data is generated every day from each device, from the simplest to the most complex one, dealing with data to analyse it and extract real information is key to each business. The Bid Data research area will work in synergy with the HPC/Cloud research area to study and investigate into new methods for information extraction and visualisation. In particular, this research area is dedicated to designing and developing a prototype of a Leonardo framework for Big Data applications, which is capable of exploiting the computing power of the davinci-1 supercomputer, specialising in predictive maintenance applications such as logistics, aftermarket, and complex systems. In 2021 data lake infrastructures were implemented for the Divisions, starting with that of the Helicopters Division, which allow the management and analysis of the big data of Leonardo products. As early as the end of 2021, the Helicopters Division put the first digital services on the market based on the exploitation of the data lake infrastructure built within the davinci-1 cloud infrastructure.
HPC\CLoud This research area aims to support the Company in the process of innovation by directing it towards the adoption of cutting-edge digital technologies, which are capable of exploiting the power of High Performance Computing (HPC) and the cloud. In particular, this research area is dedicated to: deploying and running thirdparty or proprietary applications used for the design of Leonardo products; optimising applications to maximise the exploitation of the HPC infrastructure; supporting code modernisation and porting of proprietary applications in a distributed environment; implementing a cloud solution for the Company and its customers adopting IaaS, PaaS and SaaS (National Cloud, Military & Space Cloud) paradigms. During 2021 the porting of several proprietary codes was carried out, achieving significant increased performance both in execution times (200x/300x) and memory allocations.
Digital twin\Advanced Simulation Leonardo is studying how to realise a digital copy of a product, a system or an industrial process that models its behaviour, thus allowing an increase in safety, efficiency and sustainability (through a lower use of materials and energy), and a reduction in development costs. The digital twin therefore offers new opportunities in the AD&S sector and applications that benefit the company, in areas such as global monitoring, healthcare, smart cities, multimodal logistics and public administration. During the year, in particular, projects were started for the implementation of the simulation component for the digital twin of helicopters and aircraft.
Materials Materials research programs concern new technologies for application to new products, especially in the avionics field. In particular, this research area is dedicated to graphene applications in the aerospace and defense fields (e.g., low radar observability, ballistic protection, thermal management), high performance materials for special applications (including high temperature, high erosion), meta-materials and metasurfaces used to engineer the electromagnetic response of the material itself.
Details of the Labs and the three research areas of Autonomous Intelligence Systems, Electrification, and Quantum are provided below.

Leonardo-Solvay Joint Lab Leonardo-IIT Joint Lab. 
The Joint Lab with Solvay is headquartered at Leonardo Lab of Materials in Grottaglie and supported by Solvay MSAC - Application development centre in Brussels. The Leonardo-Solvay Joint Lab operates in the sector of engineered materials with a thermoplastic matrix and, in particular, in the field of welding and automatic lamination of complex and large aerospace structures, in order to improve properties of products and extend their life cycle. Thermoplastic composites offer in fact unique advantages, including weight reduction, for more fuel-efficient aircraft. In addition, the new material does not require the use of an autoclave during the manufacturing phase to consolidate parts, thus enhancing the efficiency on the production line. Collaboration is a key factor of competitiveness in research on advanced materials as it allows performance and safety of products to be improved, with a direct impact on environmental impact and consumption of resources, giving impetus to a circular and efficient production system. In particular, activities have been started for the creation of a "circular supply chain of composite materials" (Carbon Fiber Reinforced. 
Polymers - CFRPs) with the aim of fostering the reuse and recycling of the material, while avoiding the production of waste. The quality of recovered fibers will be assessed in order to define possible future applications in many application domains (aeronautics, automotive, green energy, etc.).
The collaboration with the Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT) takes place at the Leonardo Lab in Genoa and concerns research and development in three areas of interest: Robotics for manufacturing, Space robotics and Computational Sciences. It has been designed to develop and combine robotics and automation technologies with machine vision, machine learning, AI, augmented reality, remote-controlled systems and IoT, and will enable multi-purpose applications - from defence to civil markets, from disaster recovery to space applications - thanks to the ability to deal with realworld scenarios: recognizing objects, people's behaviour and dynamic events, classifying activities, predicting events, reconstructing the 3D environment, while exploiting all available sources of data. Such smart capabilities spread across many application domains, including surveillance, drone control, robotics, machineto-machine and man-machine interactions. In the field of computational sciences Leonardo and IIT are working together on new algorithms for green computing, the assessment of cloud federation technologies, which allow the exchange of the workloads of Franklin and davinci-1 supercomputers to better manage peaks, and the study of computational applications that can demonstrate the advantage of using quantum computers.

SUPPLY CHAIN VALUE. 
Leonardo’s supply chain is made up of 11,000 companies around the world, which contribute on a daily basis to the competitiveness of the business, ensuring compliance with quality and safety requirements in the supplies and actively collaborating in the management of contracts and open innovation processes. It is a supply chain that includes both international Aerospace, Defence and Security players, which supply highly complex systems and subsystems integrated into Leonardo platforms, and many small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), the technological specialisation of which contributes to the creation and success of our products. Leonardo's considerable industrial footprint in its four domestic markets (Italy, the United Kingdom, the United States and Poland) has in fact enabled the development of local supply chains with a high intensity of knowledge and innovation, which are a key asset for the relevant local areas in terms of economic and employment impact and even more so for the quality of the skills developed and the technological content of the products and services we create. This is where most of the Group's purchases are concentrated and Leonardo acts as a driver to the growth of the chain, through the creation of partnerships and the implementation of development programmes.

Supplier relations are managed by a professional family of over 1,700 Procurement & Supply Chain professionals worldwide, and are engaged to create a quality, innovative, integrated, resilient and sustainable supply chain. This objective relies on four key pillars within which projects, initiatives and concrete tools are developed to support our Group's growth, building a sustainable partnership with the excellences in the supply chain, while optimising costs and creating value, in compliance with Leonardo's security and compliance standards.
4 Pillars of Leonardo’s procurement and supply chain strategy. 
Sustainable growth Efficiency and value creation Delivery / Excellence of processes Security & Compliance. 
Partnerships and supplier development programmes Through specific instruments, which are also applied in partnerships with external stakeholders, and a continuous improvement approach, Leonardo aims to ensure greater punctuality and quality of supplies, as well as a qualitative and quantitative growth of the partners, with a focus on the development of the suppliers’ expertise, the ability to innovate and a greater financial stability. These are the factors necessary to increase business resilience and sustainability and become more competitive in international markets. The Leonardo Empowering Advanced Partnerships (LEAP) programme is the supplier management model, now in its fourth year of implementation, which is aimed at creating the best conditions to enhance capabilities and technological excellence of its partners. The process starts from the analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of key suppliers, on some high-impact categories, overcoming the traditional dimensions of price and performance, in order to identify the suppliers eligible for advanced collaboration initiatives and medium/long-term partnerships. About 200 suppliers were preliminary identified for a partnership path. In particular, for over 120 suppliers, improvement and development projects have already been launched, including targeted managerial and technical-specialist training programmes, long-term commercial partnership agreements, agreements for financial support, support for technology transfer, digital transformation and cybersecurity. Preliminary results of the study conducted by a group of researchers from Italian universities show that since 2018 companies involved in LEAP have recorded substantially higher growth in turnover (+20% in 2020 compared to 2017), in intangible assets, which double, and in EBITDA (+50%), compared to suppliers of similar characteristics not involved in LEAP.

Report on operations at 31 December 2021. 
In 2020 LEADS (Leonardo Assessment and Development for Sustainability) was introduced, which was the new model for the assessment of sustainability issues and risks and the development of key suppliers, with the objective of an all-round growth of Leonardo's partners on several components and with parameters that can be measured over time: Operational Performance (punctuality, quality), Technical skills and industrial capabilities (Technical Capabilities, Operational Excellence, Capacity, Cost Attention), ESG Sustainability (Compliance, Business Health, Social-Environmental Responsibility, Innovation, Managerial Capabilities). With reference to the last axis (ESG Sustainability), through a questionnaire consisting of about 200 questions, Leonardo analysed over 500 key suppliers67, in 2021, assessing their maturity on the five areas indicated and identifying strengths and areas for improvement in the supply chain. Each participant received the assessment form with a preliminary development roadmap. The assessment thus represents the starting point for building the path to a new concept of excellence for an integrated and sustainable ecosystem. Among the 500 key suppliers analysed on the ESG Sustainability component, 38 also completed LEADS on the other two assessment axes (Operational Performance and Technical skills and industrial capabilities) and were included in continuous improvement paths whose progress is monitored by a multifunctional and multidivisional team on a quarterly basis.

Thematic workshops have been organised with the 18 partners: during the last conference held in 2021, focused on sustainability, experts from each supplier and of Leonardo UK presented initiatives and opportunities to comply with Leonardo’s commitments to reducing CO2.
Supplier 360 Capability Assessment – More than 20 key suppliers of the Electronics Division in the United Kingdom are involved in the Leonardo programme for evaluation and development of technical capabilities and performance, while also paying attention to ESG issues.
 

Sustainable supply chain management Among key priorities for Leonardo is that of ensuring the sustainability of our supply chain, which represents a strong commitment to the Group's stakeholders. In recent years, our focus on environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues has gradually increased in all phases of collaboration with suppliers: from the application to become a supplier, to the pre-qualification and qualification phases to enter the register, from selection criteria to the contractual Terms & Conditions, up to due diligence audits and development plans of suppliers. In the pre-qualification phase Leonardo verifies whether the economic, financial, ethical, legal, social and environmental requirements are met, while in the qualification phase it assesses the technical and operational capabilities of the supplies, as well as the minimum requirements requested by Leonardo on environmental management, health and safety, cyber security and intellectual property protection. According to the product sector, an additional verification, the Product Qualification, may be necessary to check compliance with the technical requirements of the component or part to be purchased. Furthermore, for some product areas, supplier selection takes account of the availability of specific additional ESG requirements, for example, the possession of ISO 14001, ISO 45001, quality and cyber security certifications.
Maintenance of the requirements is monitored via periodic checks throughout the entire duration of contractual relationships, both through recurring audits (every two years for pre-qualification requirements and every three years for qualification requirements) and through audit plans, with serious or repeated noncompliance with requirements resulting in temporary or definitive exclusion from the Register68.
In the United Kingdom, Leonardo has been actively involved for years in the JOSCAR (Joint Supply Chain Accreditation Register) industry project to qualify joint suppliers and help guide the future development of the Aerospace and Defense programme in the country. In 2021, the Group increased its participation in the program to over 700 suppliers involved. The initiative continues to evolve as more companies join the

Report on operations at 31 December 2021 community of buyers and the evaluation criteria used are updated to reflect the latest industry developments in the field of ESG69. The Group has also launched specific projects that involve suppliers to integrate environmental factors into supply chain management and reduce its environmental impact, including working groups and workshops to promote decarbonisation and chemical and environmental compliance, research projects to create more efficient products and materials that reduce atmospheric and acoustic emissions, and exploit technologies such as additive manufacturing, as well as pilot projects to promote the reuse of packaging70.
Main phases of supplier selection and management71. 

Leonardo engages suppliers on key and operational issues relating to the supply chain, including obsolescence management, procurement of critical materials and the growing risk of cyber attacks. An increasing number of selected suppliers share their risk registers with Leonardo, and the company, in turn, shares the results of risk analyses with them as part of related projects.
Involvement of suppliers. 
Crisis teams (Covid-19, raw materials and electronic components) - Leonardo has established a multi-divisional management team for structured coordination among procurement managers across various countries to manage communication, monitoring and action plan definition activities on global procurement issues. The team, which started its operations during the Covid-19 emergency in 2020, continued its work in 2021, with a focus on assessing and mitigating procurement issues concerning raw materials and microchips. 
REACH and chemical substances - Leonardo acts in compliance with the REACH regulation, with the objective of reducing the use of hazardous substances from its processes and products by 2024, taking account of the specific features of each business in which it operates. The Company has identified the hazardous substances used in industrial processes, started a rationalisation of the substances purchased, in compliance with the restrictions and exceptions provided for by the Regulation, and provided for mitigation plans for each Division,

Report on operations at 31 December 2021 through ongoing monitoring of suppliers of greatest interest, with synergistic activities between Divisions and Corporate.
Electronic component analysis – In the United States Leonardo DRS has created a tool to identify Circuit Card Assembly (CCA)related risks and improve supplier performance. The tool allows in fact the analysis of more than 1,500 CCAs associated with about 40,000 components, identifying risks of obsolescence, lead-time, price, or related supply shortages. It has also set up four Commodity teams to manage these risks in a coordinated manner during the pandemic. In particular, automated tools have been developed to improve CCA component obsolescence management and decision-making processes, which are linked to internal and external sources, which reduce analysis time by more than 50%. In this manner, Leonardo DRS has identified opportunities to ensure product development and production despite procurement-related challenges.
Security and resilience – Leonardo has strengthened security risk management in the supply chain by requiring security requirements from the qualification stage. For project supplies that must meet specific security requirements or key projects, it has outlined a homogeneous, cross-sector approach to identifying, assessing and managing security risks, monitoring identified risks and related treatment actions on an ongoing basis, and fostering better communication between Divisions, as well as integration into the Company's risk management process. In the United Kingdom, Leonardo also participates in the cross-sector Supply Chain Resilience Working Group, launched by the UK Ministry of Defence in 2020 to better manage risks and strengthen supply chain resilience; while in the United States, to effectively respond to the US Department of Defense’s regulations, aimed at mitigating cyber security risks in the supply chain, Leonardo has organised several workshops for Leonardo DRS procurement and supply chain professional family to support large and small suppliers in achieving or exceeding compliance with the new regulations. Regulatory compliance tracking systems have also been strengthened, making it easier to support the supplier and take action to mitigate risks.
as well as specific objectives for the reduction, and where technically possible, the elimination of hazardous substances from products, while also taking advantage of eco-design initiatives that make it possible to identify alternatives with lower impact right from the design phase. Leonardo collaborates with third-party business partners to identify, develop and test together alternative solutions, including within the framework of national and European research and funding programmes, and involves suppliers in the management of hazardous substances and compliance with REACH regulations through contractual clauses and training courses on the subject. Leonardo participates and leads the working group of the European Aerospace and Defense Association (ASD) on REACH and chemical substances, supporting the actions towards the European Commission and Parliament and the dialogue with the European Defence Agency (EDA). Among the projects carried out in this context are the definition of a guideline to simplify the approach for waste management in the sector (Waste Framework Directive); the Working Group set up within the Chemical Strategy for Sustainability REACH and Classification, Labelling and Packaging (CLP) to inform the European Union of the needs of the sector in view of the update of the REACH and CLP regulations; participation in the CEFIC (European Chemical Industry Council) round tables to follow initiatives related to product sustainability and safe and sustainable design.

Customer support and training Leonardo offers customized solutions and innovative, value-added after-sales support services: from the offer of integrated services to continuous hardware and software upgrade that ensures customers extended performance over time, as well as to training programmes, which are required to maintain direct contact with end users and nurture a strategic relationship in the long term. The development of the Customer Support, Services & Training business and the improvement in customer satisfaction are among the objectives of Leonardo's Strategic Plan, which are pursued through a transformation that involves the organization, processes, procedures, the way of doing business and, above all, people. This is a paradigm shift, from "product support" to "customer support", which leverages some key concepts for greater resilience: customer centricity, servitization, continuous improvement, development of hard and soft skills, data management, through the application of smart technology and increasingly digitised processes and products. The organic management of customer satisfaction and customer support management tools ensures a high level of information integrity and full transparency in customer communication, while improving the relationship with the company and facilitating the digitalization of services with a view to sustainable innovation. Training, which is a strategic area for Leonardo, is based on advanced technologies for the virtual reproduction of systems and their operational use. In addition to raising the level of skills transferred and scenarios on which to train, the use of flight simulators allows cuts on real flight hours, with a positive impact on costs and environmental and noise pollution. Virtual and augmented reality technologies, distinguished by their high quality, are also used for maintenance and predictive maintenance, thus helping to prevent and identify failures and inefficiencies and reduce the environmental impact of logistics management, enabling remote operations and thereby reducing physical travel to support operations.
Over 33,700 training hours delivered through flight simulators. 
About 11,100 pilots and operators of helicopters and aircraft trained.

Pilot training Customer intimacy. 
International Flight Training School (IFTS) - The programme was born from the strategic collaboration between the Italian Air Force and Leonardo for the creation of an advanced flight training centre at international level in the training of military pilots, as from the advanced phase of training (Phase IV), intended for next-generation aircraft. Currently the IFTS is operational at the 61st Wing in Galatina (Puglia) with the M346 Integrated Training System. During 2022, the IFTS will move to Decimomannu base in Sardinia, its final location where it has also been selected for NATO Flight Training Europe (NFTE) fighter pilot training as from 2023. The use of the M-346, which is now the most advanced training aircraft available on the market, and the related Ground Based Training System (GBTS), a state-of-the-art system that incorporates flight and mission simulation, will allow a significant and gradual reduction in actual flight hours, which are generally performed on fighter aircraft, much more costly. 
Customer satisfaction – With the use of the Net Promoter System (NPS) methodology during 2021, more than 200 customers have been involved from the civil, military and government markets in more than 50 countries all over the world in measuring Customer Satisfaction. The objectives have been achieved to obtain a deeper and more complete knowledge of the perception of Leonardo on the part of its customers and take corrective measures to be implemented, with a view to continuous service improvement for the customer. There was an increase in the number of replies received and, in particular, of the reference index for customer satisfaction, compared to the previous 12 months.

Innovation with the Italian Army - For the second year Leonardo and the Training Command and Application School of the Army in Turin have launched a project concerning the "Innovative use of unmanned systems and application of artificial intelligence in the operational environment", in which 120 Officers have participated to identify innovative solutions to meet the operational needs of the Armed Forces through the use of unmanned systems, autonomously guided, operating in three domains: land, air and sea and application of artificial intelligence. As part of the Contest, Officers have developed projects in the fields of communications, mine clearance, through surveillance to drone search, and logistics and transportation. The numerous projects have been evaluated by a Commission, composed of military and company members, while also assessing the industrial interest of the proposals.
Social value and industrial collaboration programmes Leonardo is committed to generating positive impacts for the communities that host its sites and production facilities. For this reason, sustainability topics are integrated into initiatives, projects and working methods. Specific metrics are used to assess the effectiveness of these actions and quantify the impact produced on local communities. Moreover, this approach becomes also relevant in relations with those governments that, on the occasion of public tenders, exploit their spending power by providing incentives to companies to produce measurable social benefits in favour of communities, redesigning the relationship between public and private entities.

Furthermore, Leonardo collaborates with its international customers to generate economic and industrial benefits, both in the civil and Defence sectors, under industrial offset agreements. In 2021, Leonardo had 62 indirect offset contracts in place around the world72.

Report on operations at 31 December 2021. 
As part of the "Sumeri Moderni" project, which aims to develop increasingly efficient and sustainable logistics services to support citizens, even in view of the steady growth of e-commerce, Leonardo has completed tests for the delivery of goods on urban routes between 15 and 50 km (middle mile delivery) through the use of an electrically powered cargo drone capable of carrying up to 170 kg. This activity, which is unique in Europe, was authorised by ENAC and conducted by Leonardo with Poste Italiane and in collaboration with D-Flight and FlyingBasket, an Italian start-up with which Leonardo is collaborating under a commercial and technological agreement in terms of open innovation. Cargo capacity, a high level of aircraft automation and advanced services for air traffic management are among the factors capable of enabling sustainable logistics in cities too, with benefits in terms of delivery speed and reduced congestion. These experiments are part of Leonardo's path to innovation in Advanced Air Delivery to speed up the introduction of drones in the sky and contribute, starting from Italy, to the development of sustainable innovative services.

Advanced Air Mobility for passenger transport. 
This is a sustainable vertical mobility solution based on short/medium distance point-to-point vertical take-off and landing flights through hybrid/electric powered VTOL (eVTOL) aircraft based on non-conventional architectures (e.g. multi-rotor, lift-and-cruise, tilt-x). Its applications are mainly in the "purely civil" domain, ranging from urban/interurban transport to private/leisure use, with opportunities also in the governmental/quasi-governmental domain (e.g. light EMS). It takes advantage of low-altitude airspace and does not require a runway, relying on a simpler infrastructure, known as Vertiporto, similar to current heliports. It is hoped that in the next 10-15 years new jobs and new services can be developed around this new market, with positive effects for the society. Leonardo, through funded research projects, which in 2020 brought very encouraging results both on hybrid propulsion and on the architecture of the aircraft, and with internal developments, has set up a development roadmap. Leonardo Lab Future Rotorcraft Technologies will play a crucial role in this field by exploring the frontiers of electrification of flight on non-conventional architectures.
 
Public transport. 
Leonardo supports urban mobility with solutions that allow a better service to be offered to citizens and a more effective management to Local Public Transport companies. The Central unit function, for example, provides users with information on bus passage forecasts and departure times at bus stops, as well as alerts and reports of anomalies, through smart signage, websites and apps. The collection and accounting system collects daily all servicerelated data processed by the Central Unit and on-board systems - including location, route, speed, incidents, anomalies, users transported, interventions and other diagnostic data. These data are processed and stored in the Central Unit, providing several indexes related to the quality of the service performed compared to the planned one, representing a useful tool to define improvement actions. Leonardo is also developing smart mobility solutions that are capable of enabling the creation of a "cooperative" mobility ecosystem, in which technologies such as 5G, MultiAccess Edge Computing and real-time video streaming, together with Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, allow efficiency and road safety to be improved through priority management at critical and dangerous urban intersections in favour of public transport vehicles. This also allows bus travel times to be improved, with positive implications in terms of lower CO2 emissions and better service offered to the citizen.

Environmental Monitoring. 
PRISMA is the national hyperspectral mission to monitor and map the Earth's surface for environmental risk management. Since the beginning of its operations in 2019, the hyperspectral payload, operating in more than 200 bands in the visible and shortwave infrared spectrum, is acquiring data over the entire world, revealing all its capabilities for monitoring the Earth's delicate ecosystem, in particular for monitoring water transparency, crop health, drought, risk of biodiversity loss, fire risk, air pollution, as well as natural disasters such as volcanic eruptions, landslides, floods. PRISMA is therefore able to shed light on the health of our Planet and contribute to the achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.
State of health of vegetation. 
Floris is the high-resolution spectrometer that detects the fluorescence intensity of chlorophyll photosynthesis from about 800Km to map the state of health of the world's vegetation. It will be used under the FLuorescence Explorer (FLEX) satellite programme, scheduled in 2024, and will be capable of communicating with Sentinel-3.
Biomass is ESA's mission with launch scheduled for 2023 to monitor from Space the structure of forests, including their overall biomass and height, and to gain a better understanding of the carbon cycle, in which forests play a crucial role, storing CO2, for the global climate system. Biomass will use a specific type of P-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR), for which Leonardo is providing the Power Amplifier Subsystem (PAS).
Ozone hole. 
Earth Observation technologies


 
150. 
Report on operations at 31 December 2021. 
GOME-2 (Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2), on board MetOp satellites, is an imaging spectrometer that collects data to measure the concentration of ozone and other gases in the atmosphere, which protect Earth from the harmful effects of ultraviolet radiation.
Meteorology and climate models. 
The Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer - SLSTR, onboard the Sentinel-3 satellite, enables measurement of ocean and earth temperatures through optical and thermal sensors, providing valuable support to meteorology and climatology.
Aeolus, thanks to the ultraviolet laser ALADIN (Atmospheric LAser Doppler INstrument), is the first satellite capable of measuring wind speed and direction on a planetary scale, even where meteorological measurements are not available, such as ocean areas, allowing reliable weather forecasts to be made up to seven days and more accurate climate models to be built.
Lightning Imager, onboard the MTG-Imager satellites, the first launch of which is scheduled by the end of 2022, will provide a new capability to Europe's meteorological satellites. The instrument, from 36,000 km away, will perform ongoing monitoring, day and night, of more than 80 percent of the Earth's disk by detecting atmospheric lightning phenomena between clouds and the ground or between the clouds themselves. The acquired data will be used for very short term atmospheric forecasting (nowcasting) of particularly severe weather conditions, to validate satellite weather forecasting algorithms, for the safety of air traffic, to monitor the characteristics of long-term atmospheric lightning and to study chemical processes in the atmosphere, including the production of nitrogen oxides.
Satellites in agricolture. 
AGEA (the Italian agricultural payments agency) and e-GEOS have developed an automated and continuous process that uses data from ESA's Sentinel satellite constellation, along with other sources, to verify the correctness of the commitments of individual farmers in relation to the subsidies provided by the CAP (Common Agricultural Policy), which are also linked to the type of crops for which there are both market and environmental sustainability requirements. In 2021 the control was carried out on almost a third of the national surface. e-GEOS, again on behalf of AGEA, is therefore proceeding with the continuous extraction of information to monitor agricultural activities on more than six million cultivated plots. The spatial screening is making more and more available new data and indicators, essential to implement agri-environmental, forestry and management policies, in line with the mitigation of the impact of climate change.
Surveillance and Emergency Response technologies. 
Maritime surveillance. 
Leonardo's Falco EVO UAVs enable highly persistent monitoring and surveillance activities. Thanks to the ability to remain in flight continuously for almost 20 hours and the possibility to embark a wide variety of high performance sensors, the Falco EVO allows search and rescue activities to be carried out both near and far from the coast. In fact, the combined use of the Gabbiano radar and the electro-optical turret, together with an advanced mission system, guarantees the discovery and identification of small boats even at long distances. The satellite communication system allows the collection and sharing of data in the area of operations and the dissemination of information to command and control centers. The Falco EVO systems have been used for almost ten years for monitoring and surveillance of sensitive areas in the Democratic Republic of Congo, carrying out operations in support of humanitarian missions up to 600 km away from the main base. The system has also proved effective in support of emergency management operations and for the collection and distribution of information during the eruption of the Nyiragongo volcano. Leonardo is committed, together with the airworthiness and air traffic control authorities, to the development of procedures that ensure a full integration of UAVs in civil airspace.

Emergency Medical Services (EMS)
Leonardo's EMS helicopters are true "flying hospitals". The personnel on board have the tools to start the medical treatment of patients, stabilise them during the flight and send, through a data link and in real time, the clinical parameters to the hospital of destination. In this manner, the medical team on the ground will have all the information to intervene immediately after landing, thus saving time and ensuring patients a better chance of survival or avoiding permanent damage. The cabins can be configured with the latest generation of medical equipment: from ECMO (ExtraCorporeal Membrane Oxygenation) for blood oxygenation with extracorporeal circulation to intra-aortic balloon pump and neonatal incubators. Leonardo is working to also allow the installation on board of a portable CAT device in the future.
Integrated health emergency platform. 
Earth COgnitive system for COvid-19 (ECO4CO) is the platform proposed by Telespazio and e-GEOS, a subsidiary company formed by Telespazio (80%) and the Italian Space Agency (20%), which aims to integrate data from Earth observation and positioning satellites with non-satellite information generated by the web and social networks, using AI systems. In this way – while also using predictive analysis systems, autonomous acquisition of satellite


 
151. 
Report on operations at 31 December 2021 data, as well as tracking and data learning capabilities - ECO4CO supports surveillance activities on aggregation areas (parks, markets, stadiums) to isolate new outbreaks of the epidemic, identifying any possible gatherings. In addition, through the Logistic Planning service, the platform is able to process forecasts on the emergency situation at regional level with prediction of future healthcare needs (e.g. drugs, beds) to support local authorities, from the latest trends of new positives, cured patients, deaths, hospitalised patients and intensive care saturation. In 2021, the service platform was set out and developed and the testing phase of the cloud-based operating system was completed.

Security for Large Events. 
Leonardo provides security solutions for large events. After Expo 2015, the 2009 L'Aquila G8, 1000Miglia 2020, and major sporting events such as the 2018 and 2014 Commonwealth Games, the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympic Games, the 2013 World Cycling Championships, and the 2006 Turin Winter Olympics, Leonardo was the technology partner of the 2021 World Alpine Ski Championships in Cortina to ensure event security, improving the quality of experience for athletes, the public, and the local community. Leonardo provided a complete advanced video surveillance and video analytics solution for all event sites, with real-time on-site data collection, analysis and classification of information. It also provided secure and reliable radio communications systems for the effective coordination of security activities and emergency response.

Our audit firm applies the International Standard on Quality Control 1 (ISQC Italia 1) and, as a result, maintains a quality control system that includes documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable laws and regulations. Auditor’s responsibility. 
A. Limited assurance engagement on the DNF It is our responsibility to express, on the basis of the procedures performed, a conclusion about the compliance of the DNF with the requirements of the Decree and of the GRI Standards. Our work has been performed in accordance with the principle of "International Standard on Assurance Engagements ISAE 3000 (Revised) - Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information" (hereinafter "ISAE 3000 Revised"), issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) for limited assurance engagements. This principle requires the planning and execution of work in order to obtain a limited assurance that the DNF is free from material misstatements. Therefore, the extent of work performed in our limited assurance engagement was lower than that required for a full examination according to the ISAE 3000 Revised ("reasonable assurance engagement") and, hence, it does not provide assurance that we have become aware of all significant matters and events that would be identified during a reasonable assurance engagement. The procedures performed on the DNF were based on our professional judgment and included inquiries, primarily with company’s personnel responsible for the preparation of the information included in the DNF, documents analysis, recalculations and other procedures aimed to obtain evidences considered appropriate. In particular, we have performed the following procedures: 1. analysis of the relevant matters in relation to the activities and characteristics of the Group reported in the DNF, in order to assess the reasonableness of the selection process applied in accordance with the provisions of article 3 of the Decree and considering the reporting standard applied; 2. analysis and evaluation of the criteria for identifying the consolidation area, in order to evaluate its compliance with the provisions of the Decree;


 
3 3. comparison of the economic and financial data and information included in the DNF with those included in the Leonardo Group consolidated financial statements; 4. understanding of the following aspects: o Group's management and organization business model, with reference to the management of the matters indicated in the article 3 of the Decree; o policies adopted by the Group related to the matters indicated in the article 3 of the Decree, results achieved and related key performance indicators; o main risks, generated or suffered, related to the matters indicated in the article 3 of the Decree.
With regard to these aspects, we obtained the documentation supporting the information contained in the DNF and performed the procedures described in item 5. a) below.
5. understanding of the processes that lead to the generation, detection and management of significant qualitative and quantitative information included in the DNF. In particular, we have conducted interviews and discussions with the management of Leonardo S.p.A. and with the personnel of Wytwornia Sprzetu Komunikacyjnego “PZLSwidnik” Spolka Akcyjna and we have performed limited documentary evidence procedures, in order to collect information about the processes and procedures that support the collection, aggregation, processing and transmission of non-financial data and information to the management responsible for the preparation of the DNF.
Furthermore, for significant information, considering the Group activities and characteristics: - at group level a) with reference to the qualitative information included in the DNF, and in particular to the business model, policies implemented and main risks, we carried out inquiries and acquired supporting documentation to verify its consistency with the available evidence; b) with reference to quantitative information, we have performed both analytical procedures and limited assurance procedures to ascertain on a sample basis the correct aggregation of data.
 - for Wytwornia Sprzetu Komunikacyjnego “PZL-Swidnik” Spolka Akcyjna (Świdnik site – Helicopters division) and Leonardo S.p.A. (La Spezia and Campi Bisenzio sites – Electronics division; Pomigliano site – Aerostructures division; Venegono Superiore site – Aircrafts division), that we have selected based on their activities, relevance to the consolidated performance indicators and location, we have carried out site visits and remote interviews during which we have had discussions with management and have obtained evidence about the appropriate application of the procedures and the calculation methods used to determine the indicators.

B. Reasonable assurance engagement on the Selection of Indicators It is our responsibility to express, on the basis of the procedures performed, an opinion about the compliance of the Selection of Indicators with the requirements of the GRI Standards as described in the paragraph “Methodological Note of the NFS”. We conducted our engagement in accordance with the ISAE 3000 Revised, issued by International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) for reasonable assurance engagements. This standard requires that we plan and perform our engagement to obtain a reasonable assurance about


 
4 whether the Selection of Indicators is free from material misstatement. As part of our engagement, we have carried out procedures aimed at obtaining evidence on the data and information subjected to reasonable assurance. The procedures defined are based on the auditor’s professional judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In performing these risk assessment procedures, the auditor considers the internal control related to the Selection of Indicators in order to design assurance procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.
Below is reported the Selection of Indicators on which a reasonable assurance engagement has been performed: • GRI 302-1: Energy consumption within the organization; • GRI 302-3: Energy intensity – (measured on consolidated revenues); • GRI 303-3: Water withdrawal; • GRI 305-1: Direct (Scope 1) GHG emissions; • GRI 305-2: Energy indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions; • GRI 305-4: GHG emissions intensity – (measured on consolidated revenues); • GRI 306-3: Waste generated; • GRI 401-1: New employee hires and employee turnover (including hires of women with STEM degree); • GRI 403-9: Work-related injuries; • GRI 404-1: Average hours of training per year per employee; • GRI 405-1: Diversity of governance bodies and employees.
We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Conclusion on the limited assurance engagement on the DNF. 
Based on the procedures performed, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the DNF of the Leonardo Group for the year ended on December 31, 2021 has not been prepared, in all material aspects, in accordance with the requirements of articles 3 and 4 of the Decree and the GRI Standards. Our conclusions on the DNF of the Leonardo Group do not refer to the information included in the paragraph “Information on EU Taxonomy for sustainable activities” of the DNF itself, that are required by art.8 of the European Regulation 2020/852. Opinion on the Selection of Indicators. 
Regarding the procedures described in the section “B. Reasonable Assurance engagement on the Selection of Indicators", in our opinion, the Selection of Indicators presented in the DNF of the Group, identified in the paragraph "Methodological Note of the NFS" of the DNF itself and reported in section “B. Reasonable Assurance engagement on the Selection of Indicators" of this report for the year ended on December 31, 2021 has been prepared, in all material aspects, in accordance with the GRI Standards.

For the definition of indices, reference should be made to the paragraph on “NON-GAAP Alternative Performance Indicators”. The performance of Leonardo S.p.a.’s key indicators in 2021 confirmed the forecasts of a recovery in growth reported in the financial statements as at 31 December 2020, showing an improvement in the Company's industrial performance in 2021. Despite the continuation of the effects of the pandemic and of the consequent government rules restricting movements in 2021 too, the Company confirmed, thanks to the strength and diversification of its portfolio of products, a growing commercial and industrial performance, even compared to the pre-pandemic period, excluding for the civil business segment of the Aeronautics sector, which was still impacted by the continuation of the abovementioned effects. The volume of new orders stood at excellent levels, thus confirming the good competitive positioning of the Company's products and solutions, with Revenues rising in all the main Business areas, with the exception of the civil aviation component, which continued to be affected by low volumes of demand from the main market operators. In particular: • new orders, equal to €mil. 9,206, showed an improvement of 10.1% compared to 2020 (€mil. 8,362); • revenues, equal to €mil. 9,332, showed, compared to 2020 (€mil. 8,654), an increase of 7.8%; • operating profits remained unchanged at 4.7% compared to 2020; • EBITA recorded an increase of 8.2%, equal to €mil. 33 compared to 2020; • EBIT, equal to €mil. 306, showed, compared to 2020, an increase equal to €mil. 256, despite the recognition of costs, for amounts substantially in line with the previous year, generated by alignment with Governmental guidelines on health protection and prevention of the spread of Covid-19. EBIT was also affected by the impact of restructuring costs associated with the agreements for early retirement of the Aerostructures division's workforce on a voluntary basis (about €mil. 70) as part of the wider restructuring plan for the Division; • the net result of €mil. 177 (against a loss of €mil. 93 at 31 December 2020) benefitted from improved EBIT and a reduction in net financial costs, which partially offset the negative change in tax; • the Company’s net debt at 31 December 2021 stood at €mil. 4,237, showing an increase of 3% (€mil. 4,114 at 31 December 2020).

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AT 31 DECEMBER 2021 1. GENERAL INFORMATION. 
Leonardo S.p.A. (hereinafter also “the Company”) is a company limited by shares based in Rome (Italy), at Piazza Monte Grappa 4, and is listed on the Italian Stock Exchange (FTSE MIB). The Leonardo Group (hereinafter also “the Group”) is a major Italian high technology organization operating in the Helicopters, Defence Electronics and Security, Aeronautics and Space sectors.
2. FORM, CONTENT AND APPLICABLE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS. 
In application of EU Regulation 1606/2002 of 19 July 2002 and of Legislative Decree 38 of 28 February 2005, the consolidated financial statements of the Leonardo Group were prepared in accordance with the international accounting standards (IFRS) endorsed by the European Commission, supplemented by the relevant interpretations (Standing Interpretations Committee - SIC and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee - IFRIC) issued by the International Accounting Standard Board (IASB) and in force at the year-end.
The general principle used in preparing these consolidated financial statements is the historical cost method, except for those items that, in accordance with IFRS, are obligatory recognised at fair value, as indicated in the valuation criteria of each item.
The consolidated financial statements are composed of the consolidated separate income statement, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of financial position, the consolidated statement of cash flows, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and the related notes to the financial statements.
Among the options permitted by IAS 1, the Group has chosen to present its balance sheet by separating current and non-current items and its income statement by the nature of its costs. Instead, the statement of cash flows was prepared using the indirect method.
The International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) used for preparing these consolidated financial statements are the same that were used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements at 31 December 2020 except for what indicated below (Note 5).
All figures are shown in millions of euros unless otherwise indicated.
Preparation of the consolidated financial statements under the going-concern assumption required management to make certain evaluations and estimates. The main areas affected by estimates or assumptions of particular importance or that have significant effects on the balances shown are described in Note 4.
The consolidated financial statements at 31 December 2021 of the Leonardo Group were approved by the Board of Directors on 10 March 2022 that authorised their distribution. Publication is scheduled for the same day. The consolidated financial statements are subject to a statutory audit by EY SpA.


 
171. 
Consolidated Financial Statements at 31 December 2021 3. ACCOUNTING POLICIES 3.1 Standards and scope of consolidation. 
The consolidated financial statements include the statements at 31 December 2021 of companies consolidated on a line-by-line basis, which have been prepared in accordance with the IFRSs as applied within the Leonardo Group. The consolidated entities and the respective shares held either directly or indirectly by the Group are reported in the attachment “Scope of consolidation”.
Subsidiaries. 
The entities over which Leonardo exercises a controlling power, either by directly or indirectly holding a majority of shares with voting rights or by exercising the right to earn the variable profits deriving from its relations with those same entities, impacting on such profits and exercising its power on the company, also regardless of the nature of the shareholding, have been consolidated on a line-by-line basis. With regard to the activities of the Group in the USA, it is noted that some of them are subject to specific governance rules (such as the Special Security Agreement and the Proxy Agreement), which were agreed with the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (“DCSA”) of the US Department of Defense (in charge of the protection of information related to the national security or, however, subject to special confidentiality restrictions). In particular, the Leonardo DRS group is managed through a Proxy Agreement, which provides for the appointment by Leonardo US Holding (the parent company of Leonardo DRS) – after consultation with Leonardo S.p.A. - of the US Proxy Holders subject to the approval of the DCSA. These Proxy Holders (with US nationality and residence, security clearance and independent with respect to Leonardo DRS and the Leonardo Group), besides acting as the directors of the company, together with Non-Proxy Holders directors (including the CEO) appointed by them according to the designation by Leonardo US Holding, are also entitled to vote on behalf of the latter, in the context of a trust relationship on whose basis their activity must protect, on one hand, the legitimate interest of the shareholders, and, on the other hand, the need for national security in the United States. The Proxy Holders are always in a number greater than the Non-proxy Holders and cannot be discharged by the shareholder, except in case of fraud or gross negligence or, subject to the approval of the DCSA, if their conduct infringes the principle of preservation of Leonardo DRS assets and the legitimate interests of the shareholders. Moreover, the Proxy Holders are committed to implementing specific governance procedures in order (i) to guarantee shareholders their rights and an adequate flow of information, above all with regard to the results of operations and financial data, with the consent of the DCSA and in compliance with the restrictions under the Proxy Agreement in relation to “classified” information, as well as (ii) to protect the management against any possible influence exercised by the foreign partner as to “sensitive” information. On the contrary, the decisions on M&A transactions and the transfer of intellectual property rights, as well as extraordinary debt assumption and intercompany business reorganisations are the direct competence of the shareholder.
Not consolidated on a line-by-line basis are those entities which, because of the dynamics of their operations (e.g. consortia without shares and controlling interests in equity consortia which, by charging costs to their members, do not have their own financial results and the financial statements of which do not, net of intercompany assets and liabilities, have material balances) or their current status (e.g. companies that are no longer operational, have no assets or personnel, or for which the liquidation process appears to be essentially concluded), would be immaterial to the Group’s situation in both quantitative and qualitative terms.
All controlled entities are consolidated at the date on which control was acquired by the Group. The entities are removed from the consolidated financial statements at the date on which the Group loses control.


 
172. 
Consolidated Financial Statements at 31 December 2021. 
Business combinations are recognised using the purchase method where the purchase cost is equal to the fair value, at the date of the purchase of assets acquired, of liabilities incurred or assumed, as well as the capital instruments, if any, issued by the purchaser. The cost of the transaction is allocated recognising assets, liabilities and the identifiable contingent liabilities of the acquired company, at their related fair value at the purchase date. Any positive difference between the cost of the transaction and the fair value at the date of the purchase of the assets and liabilities is allocated to goodwill. In the event the process of allocating the purchase price should result in a negative difference, this difference is recorded in the income statement.
Any capital gains or negative differences arising from business combinations between entities under common control ("transactions under common control") are not recognised through P&L but directly in equity in the separate financial statements.
Additional charges related to the acquisition are recognised in the income statement at the date when services are rendered.
In the case of purchase of controlling stakes other than 100% stakes, goodwill is recognised only to the extent of the portion attributable to the Group Parent. The value of the non-controlling interests is determined in proportion to the non-controlling equity investments in the identifiable net assets of the acquired company.
In case the business combination is carried out through more than one phase, at the moment of the taking over the equity investments previously held are re-measured at their fair value and the difference (positive or negative), if any, is recognised in the income statement.
In the case of purchase of non-controlling stakes, after control is obtained, the positive difference between the acquisition cost and the book value of the non-controlling stakes acquired is recorded as a reduction of the net equity of the Group Parent. In the event of disposal of stakes while control is retained, the difference between the cashed consideration and the book value of the stakes sold is recorded directly as an increase of the net equity, without recording in the income statement.
Amounts resulting from transactions with consolidated entities have been eliminated, particularly where related to receivables and payables outstanding at the end of the period, as well as interest and other income and expenses recorded on the income statements of these enterprises. Also eliminated are the net profits or losses posted between the consolidated entities along with their related tax adjustments.
Jointly controlled entities and other equity investments. 
Joint Arrangements, based on which joint control over an arrangement is assigned to two or more parties, are classified as either a Joint Operation (JO) or a Joint Venture (JV), on the basis of an analysis of the underlying contractual rights and obligations. In particular, a Joint Venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties, whilst holding control over the main strategic and financial decisions through voting mechanisms requiring the unanimous consent on such decisions, do not hold legally significant rights to the individual assets and liabilities of the JV. In this case joint control regards the net assets of the joint ventures. This form of control is reflected in the financial statements using the equity method, as described below. A Joint Operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties have rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities. In this case, individual assets and liabilities and the related costs and revenues are recognised in the financial statements of the party to the arrangement on the basis of the rights and obligations to each asset and liability, regardless of the interest held. After initial recognition, the assets, liabilities and related costs are valued in accordance with the reference accounting standards applied to each type of asset/liability.
The Group’s joint arrangements are all classified as joint ventures.


 
173. 
Consolidated Financial Statements at 31 December 2021. 
Entities over which significant influence is exercised, which generally corresponds to a holding of between 20% (10% if listed) and 50% (equity investments in associates), and Joint Ventures (as qualified above) are accounted for using the equity method. When the equity method is applied, the value of the investment is in line with shareholders’ equity adjusted, when necessary, to reflect the application of IFRSs, and includes the recognition of goodwill (net of impairments) calculated at the time of purchase, and to account for the adjustments required by the standards governing the preparation of consolidated financial statements. Gains and losses realized among consolidated entities valued at equity and other Group entities consolidated on a line-by-line basis, are eliminated. In the event the Group has evidence of an impairment loss of the investment, in excess of the amount accounted for under the equity method, the Group will proceed with calculating the impairment to be recorded in the income statement which is determined as the difference between the recoverable amount and the carrying amount of the investment.
Any value losses in excess of book value are recorded in the provision for risks on equity investments, to the extent that there are legal or implicit obligations to cover such losses, which are in any case within the limits of the book equity.
The fair value of equity investments, in the event this method applies, is calculated based on the bid price of the last trading day of the month for which the IFRS report was prepared, or based on financial valuation techniques for not listed instruments.
Investments available for sale, like those acquired with the sole purpose of being disposed within the subsequent twelve months, are classified separately within “Assets held for sale” applying the recognition criteria described in Note 3.23.
3.2 Segment information. 
In accordance with the compliance model followed, management has adopted operating segments that corresponds to the business sectors in which the Group operates: (Helicopters, Defence Electronics and Security, Aeronautics, Space and Other Activities).
3.3 Currency translation. 
Identification of the functional currency. 
The balances of the financial statements of each Group entity are presented in the currency of the primary economy in which each enterprise operates (the functional currency). The consolidated financial statements for the Leonardo Group have been prepared in euros, as this is the functional currency of the Group Parent.
Translation of transactions denominated in a foreign currency. 
Items expressed in a currency other than the functional currency, whether monetary (cash and cash equivalents, receivables or payables due in pre-set or measurable amounts, etc.) or non-monetary (advances to suppliers of goods and services, goodwill, intangible assets, etc.), are initially recognised at the exchange rate prevailing at the date on which the transaction takes place. Subsequently, the monetary items are translated into the functional currency based on the exchange rate at the reporting date, and any differences resulting from this conversion are recognised in the income statement. Non-monetary items continue to be carried at the exchange rate on the date of the transaction.


 
174. 
Consolidated Financial Statements at 31 December 2021. 
Translation of financial statements expressed in a currency other than the functional currency. 
The rules for translating financial statements expressed in a foreign currency into the functional currency (except where the currency is that of a hyper-inflationary economy, a situation not applicable to the Group) are as follows: • the assets and liabilities presented are translated at the end-of-period exchange rate; • costs and revenues, charges and income presented are translated at the average exchange rate for the period in question, or at the exchange rate on the date of the transaction in the event this is significantly different from the average rate; • the “translation reserve” includes both the exchange rate differences generated by the translation of balances at a rate different from that at the close of the period and those that are generated by the translation of opening equity balances at a rate different from that at the close of the period. The translation reserve is reversed to the income statement upon the full or partial disposal of the equity investment that results in loss of control.
Goodwill and adjustments deriving from the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities related to the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the end-of-period exchange rate.
With reference to data comparability, the current year has been marked by the following changes in the euro against the main currencies of interest for the Group: 31 December 2020 31 December 2021 % Change average final average final average final. 
U.S.A. Dollar 1.1422 1.2271 1.1827 1.1326 3.5% (7.7%)
Pound Sterling 0.8897 0.8990 0.8596 0.8403 (3.4%) (6.5%) 
3.4 Intangible assets. 
Intangible assets are non-monetary items without physical form, but which can be clearly identified and generate future economic benefits for the company. They are carried at purchase and/or production cost, including directly related expenses allocated to them when preparing the asset for operations and net of accumulated amortisation (with the exception of intangibles with an indefinite useful life) and any impairments of value. Amortisation begins when the asset is available for use and is recognised systematically over its remaining useful life. In the period in which the intangible asset is recognised for the first time, the amortisation rate applied takes into account the period of actual use of the asset.
Development costs and non-recurring costs are recognised in the item. For further details reference is made to Notes 4.1 and 4.2.
Industrial patent and intellectual property rights. 
Patents and intellectual property rights are carried at acquisition cost net of amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation begins in the period in which the rights acquired are available for use and is calculated based on the shorter of the period of expected use and that of ownership of the rights. The useful life changes according to the business of the company and its range is between 3 and 15 years.


 
175. 
Consolidated Financial Statements at 31 December 2021. 
Concessions, licence and trademarks. 
This category includes: concessions, i.e. government measures that grant private parties the right to exclusive use of public assets or to manage public services under regulated conditions; licences that grant the right to use patents or other intangible assets for a determinate or determinable period of time; trademarks that establish the origin of the products of a given company; and licences for the know-how or software owned by others. The costs, including the direct and indirect costs incurred to obtain such rights, can be capitalised after receiving title to the rights themselves and are amortised systematically over the shorter of the period of expected use and that of ownership of the rights. The useful life changes according to the business of the company and its range is between 3 and 15 years.
Intangible assets acquired as a result of business combinations. 
The intangible assets acquired as a result of business combinations essentially refer to the order backlog and commercial positioning, customer portfolio and software/know-how; they are valued during the purchase price allocation. The assets’ useful life changes according to the business of the acquired company and ranges as follows: 
Years. 
Customer backlog e commercial positioning 7-15. 
Backlog 10-15. 
Software/know how 3. 
Goodwill. 
Goodwill recognised as an intangible asset is associated with business combinations and represents the difference between the cost incurred to acquire a company or division and the sum of the fair values assigned at the purchase date, to the individual assets and liabilities of the given company or division. As it does not have a definite useful life, goodwill is not systematically amortised but is subject to impairment tests conducted at least once a year, according to a specific procedure approved each year by the Board of Directors, unless market and operational factors identified by the Group indicate that an impairment test is also necessary in the preparation of interim financial statements. In conducting an impairment test, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the individual Cash Generating Unit (CGU) or to groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination, in line with the minimum level at which such goodwill is monitored within the Group. Goodwill related to unconsolidated associates, joint ventures or subsidiaries is included in the value of investments.
3.5 Property, plant and equipment. 
Property, plant and equipment is measured at purchase or production cost net of accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses. The cost includes all direct costs incurred to prepare the assets for use, as well as any charges for dismantlement and disposal that will be incurred to return the site to its original condition. Charges incurred for routine and/or cyclical maintenance and repairs are expensed in full in the period in which they are incurred. Costs related to the expansion, modernisation or improvement of owned or leased structural assets are only capitalised to the extent that such costs meet the requirements for being classified separately as an asset or part of an asset. Any public grants related to property, plant and equipment are recognised as a direct deduction from the asset to which they refer.
The value of an asset is adjusted by systematic depreciation calculated based on the residual useful life of the asset itself. In the period in which the asset is recognised for the first time, the depreciation rate applied


 
176. 
Consolidated Financial Statements at 31 December 2021 takes into account the date in which the asset is ready for use. The estimated useful lives adopted by the Group for the various asset classes are as follows:
Years. 
Land Indefinite useful life. 
Buildings 20-33. 
Plant and machinery 5-10. 
Equipment 3-5. 
Other assets 5-8. 
The estimated useful life and the residual value are revised at least annually. Depreciation ends when the asset is sold or reclassified as asset held for sale. In the event the asset to be depreciated is composed of significant distinct elements with useful lives that are different from those of the other constituent parts, each individual part that makes up the asset is depreciated separately, in application of the component approach to depreciation. This item also includes equipment intended for specific programmes (tooling), although it is depreciated, as with other non-recurring costs (Note 4.2), on the basis of units manufactured in relation to those expected to be produced.
The gains and losses from the sale of assets or groups of assets are calculated by comparing the sales price with the related net book value.
3.6 Investment properties. 
Properties held to earn rentals or for capital appreciation are carried under “Investment properties”; they are valued at purchase or construction cost plus any related charges, net accumulated depreciation and impairment, if any.
3.7 Impairment of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment. 
Assets with indefinite useful lives are not depreciated or amortised, but are rather subject to impairment tests at least once a year to ascertain the recoverability of their book value. The test is carried out at each interim reporting date as well, when there are internal and/or external indicators that an asset may be impaired.
For assets that are depreciated or amortised, an assessment is made to determine whether there is any internal or external indication of a loss in value. If so, the recoverable value of the asset is estimated, with any excess being recognised in the income statement.
The recoverable value of an asset is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use calculated on the basis of a model of discounted cash flows. The discount rate encompasses the risks peculiar to the asset which have not been considered in the expected cash flows.
Assets which do not generate independent cash flows are tested as Cash Generating Units.
If the reasons for such write-downs should cease to obtain, the asset’s book value is restored within the limits of the book value that would have resulted if no loss was recognised due to previous years’ loss of value. The write-back is also taken to the income statement. Under no circumstances, however, is the value of goodwill that has been written down restored to its previous level.


 
177. 
Consolidated Financial Statements at 31 December 2021 3.8 Inventories. 
Inventories are recorded at the lower of cost, calculated with reference to the weighted average cost, and net realisable value. They do not include financial costs and overheads. The net realisable value is the sales price in the course of normal operations net of estimated costs to finish the goods and those needed to make the sale. Inventories include, within “Point in time contract assets”, the production progress related to contracts which do not meet the requirements for revenue recognition over time.
3.9 Revenues and contract assets/liabilities with customers. 
Revenue from contracts with customers is recognised when the performance obligations are satisfied through the transfer of control over the good or service to the customer which may occur either over time or at a point in time.
Contracts that meet the requirements for the recognition of revenue over time are classified under “contract assets” or under “contract liabilities” based on the relationship between the Group’s performance and the customer’s payment. In particular: • “net contract assets” represent the entity’s right to consideration in exchange for goods and services that the entity has transferred to a customer; • “(net) contract liabilities” represent the Group’s obligation to transfer goods or services to the customer for which the entity has received consideration (or for which the amount is due) from the customer.
If a contract provides for more than one performance obligation, representing a contract promise to transfer a specific good or service to the customer (or a series of specific goods or services that are substantially the same and are transferred according to the same methods), the classification under assets or liabilities is carried out on an overall basis and not by each single performance obligation.
Contract assets and liabilities with customers in which the transfer of control over the goods or services to customers occurs over time are recognised using the percentage-of-completion measuring method, according to which costs, revenues and margins are recognised based on the progress of production. The state of completion is determined on the basis of the ratio between costs incurred at the measurement date and the total expected costs for the programme or based on the production units delivered.
Vice versa, if the requirements for the recognition of contracts over time are not met, revenue is recognised at a point in time; in such cases, the production progress related to contracts with customers is recognised under contract assets at a point in time within “inventories”. Such case is mostly related to certain sales in the helicopter sector where the transfer of control over certain types of goods coincides with the moment of actual delivery of the same.
Contract assets (recognised under a special item or within inventories) are stated net of any provisions for write-down.
The assumptions upon which the estimates are made are periodically updated. Any impact on profit or loss is recognised in the period in which the updates are made. If a contract is an “onerous” contract, the methods for recognition are reported in note 4.4.
Contracts with payments in a currency other than the euro, the functional currency of the Group, are measured by converting the portion of payments due, calculated using the percentage-of-completion method, at the exchange rate prevailing at the close of the period in question. However, the Group’s policy for exchange-rate risk calls for all contracts in which cash inflows and outflows are significantly exposed to


 
178. 
Consolidated Financial Statements at 31 December 2021 exchange rate fluctuations to be hedged specifically. In such cases, the recognition methods described in Note 4.3 below are applied.
3.10 Financial assets. 
The Group classifies its financial assets into the following categories: • amortised cost; • financial assets at fair value through profit or loss; • financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income.
The Group determines such classification based on the business model used in the management of financial assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset.
Financial assets are initially measured at fair value plus or minus, in the case of a financial asset or a financial liability not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial asset. Trade receivables are initially measured at their transaction price, since this is representative of the fair value.
At initial recognition financial assets are classified in one of the categories listed above and can be subsequently reclassified in other categories, only when the Group changes its own business model for their management.
The Group recognises as value adjustment the expected losses related to financial assets measured at amortised cost, to contract assets and to debt instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income. Expected losses are calculated over the credit lifetime.
The classification of assets as current or non-current reflects management expectations regarding their trading.
Financial assets at amortised cost. 
Such category includes financial assets held to collect contractual cash flows (Held to Collect), which are solely payments of principal and interest, calculated on the principal amount outstanding. All receivables are included in this category.
Such assets are measured at amortised cost, in compliance with the effective interest method, decreased by impairment losses. Interest income, exchange profits or losses and impairment losses are recognised in profit (loss) for the year as well as profits or loss from derecognition.
Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income. 
Such category includes financial assets that are possibly held by the Group with the twofold objective of collecting contractual cash flows on one hand, which are solely payments of principal and interest calculated on the total of the principal amount outstanding, and selling them on the other (Held to Collect and Sell).
Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss. 
This category includes financial assets that are not classified as measured at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income. Such category includes all derivatives (Note 3.11) and financial assets held for trading.


 
179. 
Consolidated Financial Statements at 31 December 2021. 
The fair value of financial assets held for trading is calculated by drawing from the market prices at the annual (or interim) reporting date o through financial techniques and models.
3.11 Derivatives. 
Derivatives are still stated at fair value through profit or loss unless they are deemed effective hedge for specific risk in respect of underlying assets, liabilities or commitments undertaken by the Group.
In particular, the Group uses derivatives as part of its hedging strategies to offset the risk of changes in the fair value of financial assets or liabilities on its balance sheet or the risk associated with contractual commitments (fair-value hedges) and the risk of changes in expected cash flows in contractually defined or highly probable operations (cash-flow hedges). For details regarding the methodology for recognising hedges of the exchange rate risk on long-term contracts, see Note 4.3.
The effectiveness of hedges is documented and assessed both at the start of the operation and periodically thereafter (at least every time an annual or interim report is published) and measured by comparing changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument against changes in the hedged item (“dollar offset ratio”). For more complex instruments, the measurement involves statistical analysis based on the variation of the risk.
Fair value hedge. 
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that have been designated and qualify as fair-value hedges are recognised in profit or loss, in the same manner as the treatment of changes in the fair value of the hedged assets or liabilities covered with the hedge.
Cash flow hedge. 
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that have been designated and qualify as cash-flow hedges are recognised – with reference to the “effective” component of the hedge only – in the statement of comprehensive income through a specific equity reserve (“Cash-flow hedge reserve”), which is subsequently recognised in the income statement when the underlying transaction affects profit or loss. If the occurrence of the underlying operation ceases to be highly probable, the relevant portion of the cash-flow hedge reserve is immediately recognised in the income statement. If the derivative is sold, expires or ceases to function as an effective hedge against the risk for which it was originated, the relevant portion of the “cash-flow hedge reserve” is kept recognised until the underlying contract shows its effect. The recognition of the cash-flow hedge is discontinued prospectively.
The cash flow hedge reserve also includes the recognition of fair value changes in the forward component of forward contracts, taken to the separate income statement at the time when the underlying affects profit or loss.
Determining fair value. 
The fair value of instruments quoted on public markets is determined with reference to the bid price for the instrument in question at the reference date. The fair value of unquoted instruments is determined with financial valuation techniques. Specifically, the fair value of interest-rate swaps is measured by discounting the expected cash flows, while the fair value of foreign exchange forwards is determined on the basis of the market exchange rate at the reference date and the expected rate differentials among the currencies involved.
Financial assets and liabilities valued at fair value are classified in the three hierarchical levels described below, on the basis of the materiality of inputs used in the fair value measurement. In particular:


 
180. 
Consolidated Financial Statements at 31 December 2021 • Level 1: financial assets and liabilities whose fair value is determined on the basis of the unadjusted quoted prices in an active market for identical assets and liabilities that Leonardo can access at the measurement date; • Level 2: financial assets and liabilities whose fair value is determined on the basis of inputs other than the quoted prices as in Level 1, that are directly or indirectly observable; • Level 3: financial assets and liabilities whose fair value is determined on the basis of unobservable inputs.
3.12 Cash and cash equivalents. 
The item includes cash, deposits with banks or other institutions providing current account services, post office accounts and other cash equivalents, as well as investments maturing in less than three months from the date of acquisition. Cash and cash equivalents are recognised at their fair value, which normally coincides with their nominal value.
3.13 Equity. 
Share capital. 
Share capital consists of the capital subscribed and paid up by the Group Parent. Costs directly associated with the issue of shares are recognised as a decrease in share capital when they are directly attributable to capital operations, net of the deferred tax effect.
Treasury shares. 
Treasury shares are recognised as a decrease in Group shareholders’ equity. Gains or losses realised in the acquisition, sale, issue or cancellation of treasury shares are recognised directly in shareholders’ equity.
3.14 Financial liabilities. 
Financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently classified as “measured at amortised cost” or at “fair value through profit or loss”. Financial liabilities are classified at fair value through profit or loss when these are held for trading, represent a derivative or are so designated at the time of initial recognition. Other financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method. All payables are included in this category.
Financial liabilities are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has the contractual right to settle its debts at least 12 months after the date of the annual or interim financial statements.
3.15 Taxation. 
The Group’s tax burden is made up of current and deferred taxes. If these taxes are related to income and expense recognised in equity in the statement of comprehensive income, a balancing entry is recorded under the same item.
Current taxes are calculated in accordance with the existing fiscal legislation applicable to those countries in which the Group operates and in force at the balance-sheet date. Any risks connected with a different interpretation of the positive and negative components of income, together with ongoing disputes with the tax authorities are regularly assessed, in order to adjust the provisions made.


 
181. 
Consolidated Financial Statements at 31 December 2021. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated based on temporary differences arising between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their value for tax purposes, as well as on fiscal losses. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated by applying the tax rate that is expected to be in force at the time the temporary differences will be reversed. The estimation is made based on tax laws in effect or substantially in effect at the reporting date. Deferred tax assets, including those deriving from tax losses, are recognised to the extent that, based on the company plans approved by the directors, it is probable the company will post future taxable income in respect of which such assets can be utilised.
If there are uncertain tax treatments, the Group determines whether they are likely to be accepted by the tax authorities. If acceptance is considered probable, the tax values must take account of the uncertain tax treatment, while, if acceptance is considered unlikely, the Group calculates the effect of this uncertainty using the most probable amount or expected value method.
3.16 Employee benefit obligations. 
Post-employment benefit plans. 
Group companies use several types of pension and supplementary benefit plans, which can be classified as follows: • Defined-contribution plans in which the company pays fixed amounts to a distinct entity (e.g. a fund) but has no legal or constructive obligation to make further payments if the fund does not have sufficient assets to pay the benefits accrued by employees during their period of employment with the company. The company recognises the contributions to the plan only when employees rendered their services to the company specifically in exchange for these contributions; • Defined-benefit plans in which the company undertakes to provide agreed benefits for current and former employees and incur the actuarial and investment risks associated with the plan. The cost of the plan is therefore not determined by the amount of the contributions payable in the financial period but, rather, is redetermined with reference to demographic and statistical assumptions and wage trends. The methodology used is the projected unit credit method. Accordingly, the Group recognises a liability for the same amount arising from the actuarial estimation, and recognises actuarial gains and losses immediately and in full in the period in which they occur in the statement of comprehensive income through a special equity reserve (in the “Remeasurement reserve”). To determine the amount to be entered in the balance sheet, the fair value of the plan assets is deducted from the current value of the obligation for the defined-benefit plans. This fair value is calculated using the interest rate adopted for discounting back the obligation.
Other long-term benefits and post-employment benefits. 
Group companies grant employees with other benefits (such as seniority bonuses after a given period of service with the company) that, in some cases, continue to be provided after retirement (for example, medical care). These receive the same accounting treatment as defined-benefit plans, using the projected unit credit method. However for “Other long-term benefits” net actuarial gains and losses are both recognised to profit or loss immediately and in full as they occur.


 
182. 
Consolidated Financial Statements at 31 December 2021. 
Benefits payable for the termination of employment and incentive plans. 
Termination benefits are recognised as liabilities and expenses when the enterprise is demonstrably committed to terminating the employment of an employee or group of employees before the normal retirement date or to providing termination benefits as a result of an offer made in order to encourage voluntary redundancy. The benefits payable to employees for the termination of employment do not bring any future economic benefit to the enterprise and are therefore recognised immediately as expenses.
Equity compensation benefits. 
In case the Group uses stock-option and stock-grant plans to compensate the senior management, the theoretical benefit attributable to the recipients is charged to the income statement in the financial periods for which the plan is operative with a contra-item in an equity reserve. The benefit is quantified by measuring at the assignment date the fair value of the assigned instrument, using financial valuation techniques that take account of market conditions and, at the date of each annual report, an updated estimate of the number of instruments expected to be distributed. Vice versa, the fair value initially calculated is not updated in the subsequent recognitions.
3.17 Provisions for risks and charges. 
Provisions for risks and charges are recognised when, at the reporting date, the entity has a present obligation (legal or constructive) to other parties as a result of a past event, and it is probable that, in order to settle the obligation, whose amount can be reliably estimated, an outflow of resources will be required.
The amount reflects the best current estimate of the cost of fulfilling the obligation. The interest rate used to determine the present value of the liability reflects current market rates and includes the additional effects relating to the specific risk associated with each liability. Changes in the estimates are recognised in the income statement of the year in which the change occurs. With regard to some disputes, the information required by IAS 37 “Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets” is not reported, in order to not jeopardize the Group position in the context of such disputes or negotiations.
Risks for which the emergence of a liability is merely a possibility are reported in the section in the notes on commitments and risks and no provision is recognised.
The item includes provisions for onerous contracts. For further details reference is made to Note 4.4.
3.18 Leasing. 
Group entities as lessees. 
The Group recognises the right-of-use assets and the lease liability for a lease agreement or an agreement that contains a lease component.
Right-of-use assets are valued at cost, net of accumulated amortisation and impairment losses (if any) (Note 3.7), as adjusted by any re-measurement of lease liabilities. The cost includes the value of lease liabilities, any initial direct costs sustained and the lease payments made on the commencement date or before the inception of the same agreement, net of incentives received (if any). Right-of-use assets are amortised on a straight-line basis from the commencement date to until the end of the lease term. If the agreement transfers the ownership of the underlying asset, the Group will amortise the right-of-use assets until the end of the useful life of the underlying asset at the end of the lease term.


 
183. 
Consolidated Financial Statements at 31 December 2021. 
Lease liabilities are measured at the present value of the lease payments due and not yet paid as at the commencement date of the agreement. The due payments include fixed payments, net of any lease incentives to be received, variable payments (linked to an index or an interest rate) and the amounts the Group expects to pay as security on the remaining value. Lease payments also include any possible exercise price of a purchase option that is reasonably certain to be exercised by the Group and the payment of penalties that the latter believes it shall incur for any possible early termination of the agreement. The Group restates the lease liabilities in the event of subsequent amendments being made to the agreement.
In calculating the present value of due payments the Group uses the incremental borrowing rate prevailing at the commencement date of the agreement when the implicit interest rate cannot be determined easily.
Group entities as lessors in a finance lease. 
At the date on which a lease is first recognised, the value of the leased asset is eliminated from the balance sheet and a receivable equal to the net investment in the lease is recognised. The net investment is the sum of the minimum payments plus the residual unguaranteed value discounted at the interest rate implicit in the lease contract. Subsequently, financial income is recognised in the income statement for the duration of the contract in an amount providing a constant periodic rate of return on the lessor’s net investment.
The unsecured residual value is reviewed periodically for possible impairment.
Group entities as lessors in an operating lease. 
Receipts in respect of contracts qualifying as operating leases are recognised in the income statement over the duration of the contract on a straight-line basis.
3.19 Government grants. 
Once formal authorisation for their assignment has been issued, grants are recognised on an accruals basis in direct correlation with the costs incurred. Specifically, set-up grants are taken to the income statement in direct relation to the depreciation of the relevant goods or projects, and in the balance sheet, grants are recognised as a reduction of the capitalised assets, for the amount not yet recognised to profit or loss. For the analysis of the aspects related to grants under Law 808/1985, reference should be made to Note 4.2.
3.20 Costs. 
Costs are recorded in compliance with the accrual principle.
3.21 Financial income and expenses. 
Interest is recognised on an accruals basis using the effective interest-rate method, i.e. the interest rate that results in the financial equivalence of all inflows and outflows (including any premiums, discounts, commissions, etc.) that make up a given operation.
Financial expenses attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of certain assets taking a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale (qualifying assets) are capitalised together with the related asset.
3.22 Dividends. 
Dividends are recognised in the income statement as soon as the right to receive payment arises, which is normally when the shareholders’ meeting approves the distribution of dividends.


 
184. 
Consolidated Financial Statements at 31 December 2021. 
Dividends distributed to Leonardo shareholders are reported as a change in the shareholders’ equity and are recognised as liabilities for the period in which their distribution is approved by the Shareholders’ Meeting.
3.23 Discontinued operations and non-current assets held for sale. 
Non-current assets (or disposal groups) whose carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use, are classified as held for sale and presented separately in the statement of financial position. For this to be the case, the asset (or disposal group) must be available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such assets (or disposal groups) and its sale must be highly probable within one year. If these conditions are met after the year-end, the non-current asset (or disposal group) is not classified as held for sale. However, if these conditions are met after the year-end but before the financial statements are approved for publication, appropriate information is provided in the explanatory notes thereto.
Non-current assets (or disposal groups) classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell; the corresponding values of the prior year balance sheet are not reclassified.
A discontinued operation is a component of an entity that either has been disposed of, or is classified as held for sale, and: • represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations; • is part of a single co-ordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations; or • is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale.
The results of discontinued operations – whether they have been disposed of or classified as held for sale or under disposal – are presented separately in the income statement, less tax effects. The corresponding values of the prior year, if any, are reclassified and shown separately in the income statement, for comparative purposes, net of tax effect.
3.24 New IFRS and IFRIC interpretations. 
Starting from 01 January 2021, amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 became effective within the scope of the Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 2. The amendments include the temporary lightening of requirements with respect to the effect on the financial statements when the interest rate offered in the interbank market (IBOR) is replaced by an alternative rate that is substantially risk free (Risk Free Rate - RFR). These amendments have no impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements.
Furthermore, on 31 March 2021, the IASB extended the period of application of the practical expedient under IFRS 16 related to "Covid-19 Related Rent Concessions", originally applicable through 30 June 2021 until 30 June 2022. However, the Group did not receive any Covid-19 related rent concessions.
At the reporting date, the European Commission had endorsed certain standards and interpretations that were not yet compulsory, which will be adopted by the Group in the following financial periods, if applicable. We expect no significant effects on the Group’s financial statements deriving from those amendments to standards and interpretations.


 
185. 
Consolidated Financial Statements at 31 December 2021. 
There are a number of standards or amendments to existing principles issued by the IASB or new decisions of the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) for which the revision and approval project is still under way.
4. SIGNIFICANT ISSUES AND CRITICAL ESTIMATES BY MANGEMENT. 
The preparation of the Group's financial statements requires directors to make discretionary assessments, estimates and assumptions that affect revenues, costs, assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could lead to outcomes that will require significant adjustments in the future. The aspects that required greater subjectivity by the directors in making the estimates are described below.
4.1 Research and development costs. 
This account includes costs related to the application of the results of research or other knowledge in a plan or a project for the production of materials, devices, systems or services that are new or significantly advanced (including higher set-up costs incurred compared to the costs of the asset once fully operating), prior to the start of commercial production or use, for which the generation of future economic benefits can be demonstrated. These costs are amortised according to the units-of-production method, over the period in which the future earnings are expected to be realised for the project itself. The useful life changes according to the business of the company and it exceeds 5 years on average. If such costs fall within the scope of costs defined by Group standards as “non-recurring costs”, they are recognised in a specific item under intangible assets (Note 4.2).
The initial recognition and subsequent assessment of their recoverability require complex estimates by management which estimates are influenced by a number of factors, such as the time-line of the product business plans, the company’s ability to anticipate the commercial success of the new technologies and technological obsolescence.
Research costs, on the other hand, are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. The preparation of the Group's financial statements requires directors to make discretionary assessments, estimates and assumptions that affect revenues, costs, assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could lead to outcomes that will require significant adjustments in the future. The aspects that required greater subjectivity by the directors in making the estimates are described below.
4.2 Non-recurring costs “Non-recurring costs” under intangible assets are the costs incurred in designing, prototyping, starting-up and upgrading to the technical and functional specifications of clearly identified potential clients – including higher set-up costs compared to costs for the asset once fully operating –, if they are financed, in particular under Law 808/1985 governing State aids to support the competitiveness of entities operating in the Aeronautics and Defence segments. These costs are shown excluding the benefits collected or to be collected under Law 808/1985 for programmes qualified as functional to national security and similar. The aid under Law 808/1985 is deducted from capitalised costs, and the royalties to be given to the grantor are recognised as the requirements are met (sale of products embedding the technology for which the Law permits aids). For the programmes other than national security programmes and programmes treated as such, the funds received are recognised as “Other liabilities”, making a distinction between the current portion and the non-


 
186. 
Consolidated Financial Statements at 31 December 2021 current portion, based on the date of repayment. In both cases, non-recurring costs are carried among intangible assets and are amortised within job orders on the units-of-production method.
The main capitalised costs are tested for impairment at least once a year until development is complete; after that, as soon as contract prospects change, when expected orders are no longer made or delayed. The impairment test is conducted on assumed sales plans.
The initial recognition and subsequent assessment of the recoverability of these costs require estimates, which are by their own nature complex and marked by a high level of uncertainty as they are influenced by a number of factors, such as the time-line of the product business plans, which in some cases is particularly long, and the company’s ability to anticipate the commercial success of the new technologies. These estimates therefore imply significant assessments by management which take into account the reasonable certainty that funds are received and the effects of time value in the case of deferment over more than one year of the granting of funds.
In the case of programmes that benefit from the provisions of Law 808/1985 and that are classified as functional to national security, the portion of non-recurring costs capitalised, pending the fulfilment of the legal requirements for the recognition of the amount receivable from the Ministry, is shown separately under “other non-current assets”. The related amount is calculated based on an estimate made by management that reflects the reasonable certainty that funds are received and the effects of time value in the case of deferment over more than one year of the granting of funds.
 4.3 Hedging long-term contracts against foreign exchange risk. 
In order to hedge exposure to changes in flows of receipts and payments associated with long-term construction contracts denominated in currencies other than the functional currency, the Group enters into specific hedges for the expected individual cash flows in respect of the contracts. The hedges are entered into at the moment the commercial contracts are finalised, except where the award of the contracts is felt to be highly likely as a result of existing framework contracts. Exchange-rate risk is normally hedged with plain vanilla instruments (forward contracts): in some cases, however, in order to protect the Group against any possible persistent adverse trend in some currencies, the Group might enter into more highly structured operations that, while substantively hedging the positions, do not qualify for hedge accounting under IFRS 9. In these cases, as in all cases where hedges prove to be ineffective, changes in the fair value of such instruments are taken immediately to the income statement as financial items. The effects of this recognition policy are reported in Note 31. Hedges in the former case are reported as cash-flow hedges.
 4.4 Estimate of revenues and final costs of long- term contracts. 
The Group operates in sectors and with contractual arrangements that are especially complex. They are recognised on a percentage-of-completion basis in case the requirements for the revenue recognition over time are met. Margins recognised in the income statement are a function of both the state of progress on performance obligations included in the contracts and the margins that are expected to be recognised for the completed contract.
Any requests for additional considerations arising from contractual changes, including those arising from higher costs incurred for reasons attributable to the customer, shall be incorporated in the total amount of


 
187. 
Consolidated Financial Statements at 31 December 2021 the considerations, if it is highly probable that this will be recognised by the customer, up to the expected value of such recognised amount.
Estimating the expected overall costs of contracts in progress is marked by a high degree of uncertainty as they can be influenced by a number of factors such as the engineering complexity of the products, the ability to precisely fulfil specific technical requests made by customers and to meet the manufacturing time-frame provided for in the contract. Failure to comply with such contractual terms and conditions may imply penalties and extra-costs of a remarkable amount to be considered in estimating total costs. In order to enhance support for management’s estimates, the Group has adopted contract management and risk analysis tools designed to identify, monitor and quantify the risks associated with such contracts. The amounts posted in the financial statements represent management’s best estimate at the reporting date supported by said tools.
In case the reassessment of the economic plans (whole life estimates) during the progress of a contract highlights the presence of elements that make them onerous, the amount of costs considered necessary to fulfil the obligations that is higher than the economic benefits arising from the contract is recognised in full in the financial period in which it becomes reasonably foreseeable and allocated to a “provision for onerous contracts” under provisions for current risks and charges. The reversal of such accruals is recognised as absorption under “Other operating income”.
 4.5 Liabilities from defined-benefit pension plans. 
The Group is sponsor to two UK defined-benefit pension plans and to various US and other minor European plans. It has the obligation to ensure a given level of benefits to the plan participants and carries the risk that the plan assets are not adequate to cover the benefits promised. In case these plans are in a deficit position, the trustee responsible for the management requests the Group to fund the plan.
The deficit resulting from the most updated actuarial valuations made by independent experts is recognised as a liability: these valuations stem from actuarial, demographic, statistical and financial assumptions that can vary over time.
4.6 Impairment of assets. 
Group assets are tested for impairment at least annually if their lives are indefinite, or more often if there are indications of impairment. Similarly, impairment tests are conducted on all the assets with definite useful life showing signs of impairment, even if the amortisation already commenced.
The recoverable amount is generally based on the value in use calculated according to the Discounted CashFlow method, which is characterized by a high level of complexity and the use of estimates, which are by their nature uncertain and subjective in relation with the expected cash flows and the financial parameters used to determine the discount rate.
For these valuations, the Group uses the estimated cash flows based on the plans that have been approved by corporate bodies and financial parameters that are in line with those resulting from the current performance of reference markets. The relevant plans take into account all business assessments of risks related also to technological innovations, emerging global scenarios, customer needs and expected regulatory requirements. Therefore, climate change considerations are also included.
Details about the methods for the calculation of the impairment tests are reported in Note 9.


 
188. 
Consolidated Financial Statements at 31 December 2021 4.7 Disputes. 
The Group’s operations regard sectors and markets where many disputes, both as petitioner and plaintiff, are settled only after a considerable period of time, especially in cases where the customer is a government entity. In case management deems it probable that following the litigation an outflow of resources, whose amount can be reliably estimated, will be required, this amount that has been discounted in order to consider the timeline for the disbursement, is included in the risk provision. The estimate for the developments of these disputes is particularly complex and requires significant estimates by the management. Disputes where a liability is deemed possible but not probable are shown in the relevant informative section on commitments and risks; against such disputes no allocation is made.
5. EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES ADOPTED. 
During the period there were no significant changes in the accounting standards applied by the Group.
6. SIGNIFICANT NON-RECURRING EVENTS OR TRANSACTIONS. 
With reference to the main transactions carried out during the period, on 24 April 2021 Leonardo entered into an agreement with Square Lux Holding II S.à r.l., a company controlled by funds advised by Kohlberg Kravis & Roberts & Co. L.P., to purchase a 25.1% stake in Hensoldt AG. The completion of the transaction, which entailed an outlay of about €mil. 606 (net of transaction costs), took place on 3 January 2022.
Taking into account the mid-term impacts of the pandemic on the civil sector and considering the changed prospects for the commercial aviation market, Leonardo has embarked on the announced actions aimed at mitigating the impact on the industrial performance of the Aerostructures Division. In this context, on 21 July 2021 trade union agreements were signed to make operational the instruments identified for the early retirement of employees on a voluntary basis. Such agreements will involve up to a maximum of 390 employees who will meet the criteria for early retirement in the three-year period 2021-2023, with an estimated cost of around €mil.71.
In November 2021 the Indian Ministry lifted the ban on the Leonardo Group entering the Indian market, which is why it is no longer considered convenient or consistent to bring an action against the Indian Government which would, however, have taken a very long time and had uncertain chances of success. As a result of the position taken - considering that it would have been more convenient for the Group to return as an accredited player in the Indiana area - Leonardo incurred costs associated with the write-down of residual exposures amounting to approximately €mil. 33.
7. SIGNIFICANT POST BALANCE SHEET EVENTS. 
On 3 January 2022 Leonardo completed the acquisition of 25.1% of Hensoldt AG paying the amount of €mil. 606, net transaction costs. equal to €23 per share.
Following the offensive launched by the Russian government against Ukraine, profound changes in the context of the world's geopolitical and economic equilibrium are looming up.
On the one hand, the process of integration and creation of a European Defence and Security and, at the same time, the increase in defence spending in EU and neighboring countries could be accelerated, creating opportunities for companies operating in the sector. On the other hand, Ukraine and Russia currently represent high-risk counterparts, partly due - in the case of Russia - to the numerous logistical and economic sanctions imposed by the European Union, other countries and other international bodies.


 
189. 
Consolidated Financial Statements at 31 December 2021. 
Leonardo currently has no significant exposure to these two countries. Specifically, the balance sheet exposure at 31 December 2021 to Ukraine is zero and the net balance sheet exposure to operators directly affected by the sanction regime against Russia is approximately €mil. 30. The order backlog with Russia is about €mil. 25, while the backlog with Ukraine is about €mil. 8.
 8. SEGMENT INFORMATION. 
The Divisions and companies through which the Group operates are aggregated, for the purposes of internal and external reporting, into the four business sectors of reference: Helicopters, Defence Electronics and Security, Aeronautics and Space. The segment of Other activities includes the Corporate and remaining activities.
The Group assesses the performance of its operating segments and the allocation of its financial resources on the basis of revenue and EBITA (please also see the paragraph on “NON-GAAP Performance Indicators” included in the Report on Operations). For the purpose of a correct interpretation of the information provided we note that the results of the strategic Joint Ventures have been included within the EBITA of the sectors to which these JVs belong; conversely, these sectors do not reflect the relevant share of revenue.
The results for the operating sectors at 31 December 2021, as compared to 2020, are as follows:

Consolidated Financial Statements at 31 December 2021. 
The investments for the period are stated net of related grants, which determined in 2020 a net debit balance in relation to non-recurring costs, attributable to the Aeronautics sector. Commitments are in place for the purchase of intangible assets for €mil. 33 at 31 December 2021 (€mil. 14 at 31 December 2020). The impairment of non-recurring costs mainly refers to write-downs linked to programmes in the Defence Electronics & Security sector. As set out in Note 4.1 of the consolidated financial statements, to which reference is made, development costs and non-recurring charges are tested for impairment, if the conditions obtain, using the discounted cash flow method. The cash flows used are those under the product business plan, as discounted on the basis of a weighted-average cost of capital (WACC) basis calculated using the Capital Asset Pricing Model method.
Goodwill Goodwill is allocated to the Cash Generating Units (CGUs) or to groups of CGUs concerned, which are determined on the basis of the Group’s organisational, management and control structure, which coincides, as is known, with the Group’s four business segments. Below is the breakdown of goodwill by segment at 31 December 2021 and 2020: 
31 December 2020 31 December 2021. 
Helicopters 1,237 1,266. 
Defense Electronics & Security 2,331 2,510. 
DRS 1,364 1,490. 
Leonardo Divisions 967 1,020. 
Aeronautics 60 60 3,628 3,836. 

The net increase compared to 31 December 2020 was mainly due to the foreign currency translation differences on goodwill denominated in USD and GBP. Goodwill is subject to impairment testing to determine any loss in value. This is done by individual CGU by comparing the carrying amount with the greater of the value in use of the CGU and amount recoverable by sale (fair value). The Group has established an operational hierarchy between calculating the fair value net of transaction costs and value in use, where the value in use is estimated first, and then only after, if it is lower than the carrying value, is the fair value net of transaction costs determined. In particular, the value in use is measured by the unlevered discounting of the cash flows resulting from the Group’s five-year business plans prepared by the management of the CGUs and incorporated into the plan approved by Leonardo’s Board of Directors, projected beyond the explicit time horizon covered by the plan according to the perpetuity growth method (terminal value), using growth rates (“g-rate”) no greater than those forecast for the markets in which the given CGU operates. The cash flows used were those provided for in the plans adjusted to exclude the effects of future business restructurings, if any, not yet approved, or future investments for improving future performance. Specifically, these cash flows are those generated before financial expense and taxes – determined on a notional basis, and include investments in capital assets and monetary changes in working capital, while excluding cash flows from financial management, extraordinary events or the payment of dividends. The underlying macro-economic assumptions were made on the basis of external information sources, where available, while the profitability and growth estimates used in the plans were calculated by management based on past experience and future developments in the Group’s markets.
These cash flows are discounted on a weighted-average cost of capital (WACC) basis calculated using the Capital Asset Pricing Model method. The following factors were taken into account in calculating WACCs, which were also determined by using the data referable to the main competitors operating in each sector: • the risk-free rate was determined using the 10- and 20-year gross yield of government bonds of the geographic market of the CGU;


 
193. 
Consolidated Financial Statements at 31 December 2021 • the market premium, determined using computations of external providers; • the sector beta; • the cost of debt; • the debt/equity ratio.
The growth rates used to project the CGU’s cash flows beyond the explicit term of the plan were estimated by making reference to the growth assumptions of the individual sectors in which said CGUs operate. These assumptions are based on the internal processing of external sources, making reference to a period of time that is usually ten years. The g-rates used for the purposes of the impairment test were equal to 2%, consistently with the actions taken in previous financial years, even in the presence of higher expected growth rates in some sectors.
The mostly important assumptions for the purposes of estimating the cash flows used in determining the value in use are: • WACC; • g-rate; • ROS; • the trend in Defence budgets.
In estimating these assumptions, the management made reference, in the case of external variables, to internal information processed on the basis of external surveys, as well as on its knowledge of the markets and of the specific contractual situations.
The following WACCs and (nominal) growth rates were used at 31 December 2021 and 2020: 
31 December 2020 31 December 2021. 
Wacc g-rate Wacc g-rate.

Leonardo Divisions 6.2% 2.0% 6.1% 2.0%
Aeronautics 6.7% 2.0% 6.7% 2.0% 
Testing revealed no signs of impairment but showed, on the contrary, significant positive margins (headroom). The results of the tests were subjected to sensitivity analysis, taking as reference those assumptions for which it is reasonable to believe that their change could significantly modify the results of the test. In this regard, it should be noted that in all sectors the large positive margins recorded are such that they cannot be significantly modified by changes in the assumptions described; however, for information purposes the results for all CGUs are reported below. The table below shows for the 2021 and 2020 financial years the positive margin relating to the base scenario, compared with the results of the following sensitivity analyses: (i) increase in interest rates used to discount cash flows on all CGUs by 50 basis points, the other conditions remaining equal; (ii) reduction in the growth rate in the calculation of terminal value by 50 basis points, the other conditions remaining equal; (iii) reduction in operating profitability applied to terminal value by half a point, the other conditions remaining equal. 31 December 2020 Margin (base case)

Development costs and non-recurring charges. 
Investments in “Development costs” refer to the Defence Electronics and Security and Helicopters sectors (€mil. 65 and €mil. 95, respectively). The increase in “Non-recurring charges” mainly refers to the Helicopters sector for €mil. 76 and the Defence Electronics and Security sector for €mil. 31. Total investments were affected by the grants received during the year, recognised as a decrease in the related item. As regards programmes that benefit from the provisions of Law 808/85 and that are classified as functional to national security, the portion of capitalised non-recurring costs, pending the fulfilment of the legal requirements for the classification under receivables, is separately disclosed under other non-current assets (Note 13). Receivables for grants assessed by the grantor in relation to capitalised costs (shown here net of the related grants) are illustrated in Note 28.
Impairment for the year mainly related to impairment losses on Defence Electronics and Security programmes. Impairment tests of non-recurring costs and development costs are performed on the most significant programmes in terms of capitalisation or risk or when impairment indicators emerge. They are carried out – if conditions obtain- using the discounted cash flow method. The cash flows used are those of the product business plans, discounted on the basis of a WACC rate determined by applying the Capital Asset Pricing Model.
Total research and development costs, comprising also “Development costs” and “Non-recurring charges” just mentioned, are equal to €mil. 1,803.
Other items of intangible assets “Concessions, licences and trademarks” includes in particular the value of licenses acquired in previous years in the Helicopters segment. With regard to the full acquisition of the AW609 programme, this value also comprises the estimated variable fees due to Bell Helicopter on the basis of the commercial performance of the programme (Note 24).
Intangible assets acquired in the course of business combinations mainly decreased as a result of the amortisation. Below is a breakdown of these assets: 31 December 2020 31 December 2021. 

Know-how 85 80. 
Trademarks 43 42. 
Backlog and commercial positioning 138 138 266 260. 
Specifically, “Backlog and commercial positioning” chiefly refers to the UK component related to the Defence Electronics and Security and Helicopters divisions allocated to this item during the purchase price allocation.
The item “Other” mainly includes software, intangible assets under development and advances.

The Leonardo Group operates in certain sectors also through entities jointly controlled with third parties and valued under the equity method, since they qualify as joint ventures.
Below are reported the joint ventures considered material in terms of volumes and from a strategic viewpoint for the Group:

In particular, as regards the companies falling under the so-called Space Alliance - Thales Alenia Space and Telespazio – the Company carried out an in-depth analysis of the existing arrangements, in order to verify whether situations of control (with reference to Telespazio) or of significant influence (with reference to Thales Alenia Space) existed, concluding that both entities should be considered by Leonardo as Joint Ventures. Specifically, the Space Alliance univocally regulates the governance of both companies, making reference to shareholders’ agreements prepared alike. With particular reference to Telespazio, in which the Group holds more than 50% of the stakes, the analyses performed led to deem that the company’s governance is such that Telespazio can be regarded as a jointly controlled entity by virtue of the composition rules for the decision-making bodies - these rules being such that cannot be defined as merely “protective”, as referred to in IFRS10 – and due to the expected unanimous consent of the shareholders on particularly significant matters for the company’s management. Moreover, the substantive analysis, carried out taking into account the peculiarity of the businesses, highlighted that the methods to resolve deadlocks (i.e. when a stalemate in the decision-making process occurs and the shareholders have no possibility to jointly decide on matters about which they are required to make decisions through the unanimous consent mechanism) do not allow the majority venturer to impose its will. This is because, in case no decision can be reached, despite the complex escalation mechanism under the shareholders’ agreements, the minority venturer has the right to dissolve the Joint Venture, recovering the assets originally assigned, through a call option or,


 
198. 
Consolidated Financial Statements at 31 December 2021 solely if this option is not exercisable, to leave the Joint Venture through a put option. Finally, in the event of a decision-making deadlock, the joint venture might be eventually wound up or the minority venturer might sell its interest: in both of these cases, the venturers might be required to share or transfer part of the assets – with particular reference to technological expertise or know-how – originally assigned.
On the contrary, the analysis performed by the other venturer led to different conclusions with reference to Thales Alenia Space, which is fully consolidated by Thales in spite of the previously described governance structure. The application of such different conclusions on Leonardo, with the full consolidation of Telespazio, would have changed the Group’s main indicators as follows: 2020 2021. 
Revenues +535 +595. 
EBITA +30 +33.

14. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS. 
On 23 July 2021 the Leonardo Group acquired, through Leonardo DRS, Ascendant Engineering Solutions (AES), a leading company in the design, development and production of high-performance multi-sensor gimbal systems for the growing market of the UAS groups 1, 2 and 3 of the US military services. The outlay for the acquisition amounted to USDmil. 11.5, net of cash acquired, to which a further earn-out of about USDmil. 5 will be added. The transaction generated a goodwill of USDmil. 13.8.

Consolidated Financial Statements at 31 December 2021. 
The overall effect on the balance sheet was as follows: amount in USDmil.
 
Net assets acquired 2.7. 
Cash-out 11.5. 
FV of earn out 5 16.5. 
Intangible assets from business combinations -

Goodwill 13.8. 
Furthermore, during 2021 the Group completed the acquisition of a quota of about 78% of Dispositivi Protezione Individuale S.r.l., through its subsidiary Larimart, a company 60 % owned by the Group, and the acquisition of about 70% of the quota capital of Alea S.r.l..
The acquisition of Dispositivi Protezione Individuale S.r.l., a company specialising in the design, production and sale of personal and environmental protective equipment entailed a total outlay for Larimart of about €mil. 6 and generated goodwill for the Group of approximately €mil. 1.
The acquisition of Alea S.r.l., a company specializing in mission critical communication software for multimedia solutions compliant with international standards on LTE/5G broadband networks entailed a total outlay of about €mil. 4. The values involved in the acquisition are not significant for the Group and did not generate any goodwill arising from the acquisition.
In the prior financial year, in particular on 8 April 2020, the closing took place for the transaction whereby Leonardo S.p.A. acquired 100% of the Swiss helicopter company Kopter Group AG (Kopter) from Lynwood (Schweiz) AG. The purchase price included a fixed amount of USDmil. 185 on a cash free/debt free basis, as well as an earn-out mechanism linked to specific milestones in the life of the programme, as from 2022, the fair value of which was estimated as equal to €mil. 17. The agreements also provided for Leonardo to take over the additional line of credit granted by Lynwood to Kopter during 2020, amounting to €mil. 23. As at the closing date, the total outlay for Leonardo amounted to €mil. 185, of which €mil. 123 to Lynwood and €mil. 62 to the Russian bank National Bank Trust on account of assumption of a loan that had been previously granted to Kopter. At the time of the closing, the agreements provided for Leonardo to take over all Lynwood's accounts receivable from Kopter (amounting to €122 million). As at the closing date, Kopter’s debts towards Leonardo amounted to €mil 184. Therefore, the cash out of the transaction, consisted almost entirely of Leonardo's takeover of the debt positions of the acquired company Kopter.

With reference to the values involved in the acquisition, the purchase price allocation process – subsequently completed in 2020 – led to the following results: 


Net assets acquired 201. 
Cash-out 185. 
FV of earn out 16 201.

Cash-flow hedge reserve This reserve includes changes in fair value of derivatives used by the Group to hedge its exposure to currency net of the effect of deferred taxes until the moment in which the “underlying position” is recognised in the income statement. When this condition is met, the reserve is recognised in the income statement to offset the economic effects of the hedged transaction. In accordance with the provisions of IFRS 9 governing hedge accounting, the reserve also includes the fair value change in the forward component of forward contracts (premium points), taken to the income statement when the hedged item affects profit or loss.
Translation reserve.

Net changes for current liabilities. The items also include changes resulting from the application of the effective interest-rate method, which may not correspond with actual cash movements.
The decrease in bonds compared to 31 December 2020 is attributable to the repayment of the remaining nominal amount of €mil. 739 of the bond issued (original nominal amount of €mil. 950), which reached its natural expiry in January 2021.
The Group’s issues are governed by rules with standard legal clauses for these types of corporate transactions on institutional markets that do not require any undertaking with regard to compliance with specific financial parameters (financial covenants) but they do require negative pledge and cross-default clauses. Based on negative pledge clauses, Group issuers, Leonardo and their “Material Subsidiaries” (companies in which Leonardo owns more than 50% of the share capital and the gross revenues and total assets of which represent at least 10% of consolidated gross revenues and total assets) are expressly prohibited from pledging collateral security or other obligations to secure their debt in the form of bonds or listed financial instruments or financial instruments that qualify for listing, unless these guarantees are extended to all bondholders. Exceptions to this prohibition are securitisation and, as from July 2006, the establishment of assets for the use indicated in Article 2447-bis et seq. of the Italian Civil Code. On the contrary, the crossdefault clauses give the bondholders the right to request early redemption of the bonds in their possession in the event of default by the Group issuers and/or Leonardo and/or any “Material Subsidiary” that results in a failure to make payment beyond pre-set limits.
The increase in bank payables was due to the drawdown, in January 2021, of the €mil. 200 loan raised with the European Investment Bank (EIB) in December 2020, aimed at supporting certain investment projects envisaged in the Group's Industrial Plan, as well as the Term Loan ESG-linked of €mil. 600 entered into and used during December 2021.
It should be noted that financial covenants are included in the Revolving Credit Facility of €mil. 2,400 and in the Term Loan ESG-linked of €mil. 600, which require Leonardo to comply with two Financial ratios (the ratio of Group net debt - excluding payables to the joint ventures MBDA and Thales Alenia Space and lease liabilities /EBITDA, including amortisation of the right of use assets, must be no higher than 3.75 and the ratio of EBITDA, including amortisation of the right of use assets / Net interest must be no lower than 3.25), tested

Consolidated Financial Statements at 31 December 2021 annually based on annual consolidated data. These covenants are included in the loan agreement with CDP, and in the Term Loan of €mil. 500; furthermore, in accordance with contractual provisions providing for this option, these covenants have also been extended to all EIB loans in place (they had been used for a total amount of €mil. 546 at 31 December 2021), as well as to certain loans granted in past years to Leonardo DRS by US banks. In relation to this Annual Financial Report, there was full compliance with the covenants (the two ratios are 1.2 and 11.1, respectively). Below is the reconciliation of the changes in loans and borrowings with the cash flows from financing activities: 2020 2021.

“Other provisions for risks and charges” mainly include provisions related to offset obligations and critical issues on contracts.
With regard to risks, below is a summary of the criminal proceedings that are currently underway against a number of subsidiary companies or Leonardo itself, as well as certain former directors and executives, concerning acts committed during the performance of their duties at subsidiary companies or at Leonardo itself, with specific reference to the events that occurred in 2021 and in early 2022: • On 22 May 2019 the Supreme Court rejected the appeals submitted against the judgment whereby on 8 January 2018 the Milan Court of Appeal had acquitted the former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Leonardo and the former Chief Executive Officer of AgustaWestland S.p.A. of the charges for the crimes under Articles 110, 112, paragraph 1, 318, 321 and 322-bis, paragraph 2(2) of the Italian Criminal Code and Article 2 of Legislative Decree 74/2000, within the proceedings brought in relation to the supply of twelve AW 101 VIP/VVIP helicopters to the Indian Government. In respect of these companies, it is recalled that on 25 July 2014, pursuant to Article 58 of Legislative Decree 231/2001, the Public Prosecutor dismissed the proceedings against Leonardo, holding groundless, following the conclusion of investigations, the Company’s involvement from both a factual and legal point of view. The Prosecutor also acknowledged that since 2003 the Company has adopted, actually implemented and regularly updated an Organisational, Management and Control Model that is conceptually suitable to prevent offences like the one in question and is also focused on compliance processes as to guarantee adequate standards of fairness and ethical conduct. In addition, on 28 August 2014 the Judge for Preliminary Investigations (GIP, Giudice delle Indagini Preliminari) of the


 
211. 
Consolidated Financial Statements at 31 December 2021. 
Court of Busto Arsizio – in granting the motions put forth by the companies – imposed administrative penalties pursuant to Article 63 of Legislative Decree 231/2001 and Article 444 and ff. of the Italian Code of Criminal Procedure, amounting to €80,000 for AgustaWestland S.p.A. and €300,000 for AgustaWestland Ltd, and ordered the confiscation of the equivalent of €mil. 7.5. In this regard, on 20 April 2021 the Court of Appeal of Brescia, following the requests by AgustaWestland SpA and AgustaWestland Ltd for the review of the abovementioned rulings, revoked the rulings challenged and acquitted the abovesaid companies. Since times for a possible appeal to the Supreme Court expired, the ruling became definitive; As regards the investigations started by the Indian Judicial Authority (CBI) in February 2013 for the same facts referred to above, on 2 February 2018 a notice was served on AgustaWestland International Ltd., whereby the latter was invited to appear at the hearing to be held on 30 May 2018 before the Patiala House Court in New Delhi within the criminal proceedings brought therein against the aforesaid company and other entities and persons, including Leonardo Spa. On 13 April 2018 the Milan Public Prosecutor’s Office served the abovementioned notice of invitation to appear at the hearing on 30 May 2018 on Leonardo Spa. The Company submitted an application for enforcement review before the Judge for Preliminary Investigations (GIP) of the Court of Milan, which was rejected on 22 May 2018, as well as an appeal before the Lazio Regional Administrative Court. The Company also took the same legal actions with respect to the service of the notice of invitation to appear in court at the hearing on 10 September 2018. By a judgment dated 3 July 2019, the Lazio Regional Administrative Court rejected the appeals submitted by Leonardo S.p.A.; the Company then filed an appeal against the abovementioned measures. By a judgment dated 7 May 2020 the Council of State granted the appeals submitted by Leonardo. Leonardo S.p.A. has brought the same lawsuits before the administrative Court and before the Judge for Preliminary Investigations of the Court of Milan, including with reference to the services of notice of invitation to appear at the hearings set on 18 September 2019 and 18 December 2019. The Lazio Regional Administrative Court, by judgment dated 24 September 2021, rejected the appeals submitted by Leonardo. The Company filed an appeal with the Council of State. On the contrary AgustaWestland International Ltd appeared at the hearings set within the proceedings brought by the Central Bureau of Investigation and the proceedings are continuing before the Patiala House Court of New Delhi. On 28 August 2019 the Public Prosecutor’s Office of Milan served on Leonardo S.p.A. a notice of invitation to appear at the hearing of 18 September 2019 within further proceedings brought by the Indian Judicial Authority (Directorate of Enforcement) in relation to the supply of 12 AW 101 VIP/VVIP helicopters to the Indian Government. The Company submitted an application for enforcement review before the Judge for Preliminary Investigations of the Court of Milan, as well as an appeal with the Lazio Regional Administrative Court, even in relation to this notice. The Lazio Regional Administrative Court, by the same judgment of 24 September 2021, rejected the appeal submitted by Leonardo which filed an appeal with the Council of State. Finally, it should be noted that on 11 February 2020 a notice was served on AgustaWestland International Ltd whereby it was invited to appear in court within the proceedings brought by the Indian Judicial Authority (Directorate of Enforcement). • On 23 March 2021 the Court of Naples acquitted an employee of the then Elsag Datamat (now Selex ES SpA) of the crimes referred to in Articles 353 and 326 of the Italian Criminal Code, the former Chief Executive Officer and an employee of the then Elsag Datamat of the crime referred to in Articles 326, 353 and 416 of the Italian Criminal Code, as well as it acquitted Selex ES of the offence under Article 24-ter, para. 2, of Legislative Decree no. 231/2001, within the criminal proceedings concerning contracts awarded to the then Elsag Datamat and to another company for the development, respectively, of the integrated traffic monitoring system of the city of Naples and video-surveillance

Consolidated Financial Statements at 31 December 2021 systems for a number of municipalities within the Province of Naples. The former Chief Executive Officer of the then Elsag Datamat submitted an appeal against the judgment of acquittal. • The debate phase continued within the criminal proceedings before the Court of Naples against some suppliers and subcontractors of the then Selex Service Management (now Selex ES), in relation to the awarding of the contract for the construction and operation of the Control System for Waste Tracking (SISTRI). Within these proceedings, the company brought a civil action at the hearing held on 7 November 2013. • By appeal to the Supreme Court served on 12 January 2022, the attorney general challenged the judgment whereby on 19 January 2021 the Court of Appeals of Milan rejected the appeals submitted against the judgment whereby on 15 June 2017 the Court of Milan acquitted certain directors of the then-Breda Termomeccanica S.p.A., subsequently Ansaldo S.p.A., who served during the period from 1973 to 1985, charged with having committed the crimes under Article 589, paragraphs 1, 2 and 3, Article 40, paragraph 2, Article 41, paragraph 1 of the Italian Criminal Code, Article 2087 of the Italian Civil Code and Article 590, paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, of the Italian Criminal Code, for violation of the rules governing the prevention of occupational diseases. It should be noted that Leonardo had entered appearance in the civil action within the abovementioned proceedings. • The phase of debate is still continuing within the criminal proceedings pending before the Court of Vercelli against three former employees of AgustaWestland S.p.A. (who are currently working for Leonardo – Helicopters Division) and an employee of AgustaWestland Philadelphia Corporation for the crime referred to in Article 449 of the Italian Criminal Code in relation to Articles 428 and 589 of the Italian Criminal Code, relating to the accident that occurred in Santhià on 30 October 2015.
Based upon the information gathered and the results of the analysis carried out so far, the Directors of Leonardo did not allocate any specific provisions in relation to these cases. Any negative developments - which cannot be foreseen, nor determined to date - arising from any internal investigations or judicial investigations being conducted, will be subject to consistent assessment for the purposes of provisions (if any.

With regard to the provisions for civil, tax and administrative disputes, it is underlined that the Leonardo Group companies’ operations regard industries and markets where many disputes, both as petitioner and plaintiff, are settled only after a considerable period of time, especially in cases where the customer is a government entity. Pursuant to the IFRSs, provisions have only been set aside for risks that are deemed probable and for which the amount can be determined. No specific provisions have been set aside for certain disputes in which the Group is defendant as these disputes are reasonably expected to be settled, based on current knowledge, satisfactorily and without significantly impacting the Group. Of particular note are the following disputes: • the proceedings brought by Firema under extraordinary management before the Court of Naples against the directors and statutory and independent auditors of Firema Trasporti (R.G. 32257/13) in order to have them declared responsible for the financial collapse caused to the company, within which Leonardo and AnsaldoBreda have been summoned as parties concerned, have been postponed to the hearing scheduled on 10 March 2022 for the joinder to proceedings R.G. no. 16312/15 described below. It should be noted that, within these proceedings, two of the defendants and specifically the former directors Giorgio and Gianfranco Fiore summoned Leonardo and AnsaldoBreda in court, on the grounds of an alleged abusive exercise of management and coordination activities that was perpetrated by the parties summoned to the detriment of Firema. On the basis of this assumption, Giorgio and Gianfranco Fiore therefore requested, primarily, that Leonardo and AnsaldoBreda be ordered to pay direct compensation to the plaintiff for any damages that should be ascertained, which


 
213. 
Consolidated Financial Statements at 31 December 2021 they presumed to be €mil. 262 and which is equal to Firema's liabilities, and, alternatively, to be held harmless by the aforesaid companies. As to the action brought by GMR against Leonardo and AnsaldoBreda before the Court of Naples (R.G. 16312/15), the court referred the case to the President in order for the proceedings to be possibly joined to those described above at the hearing held on 1 October 2020. It should be noted that, within these proceedings, the plaintiff company states that Firema Trasporti was allegedly subject, during the period in which Leonardo held an investment in it (from 1993 to 2005), to management and coordination activities that were carried out to its detriment and in the sole interest of the Leonardo Group and that, even after the sale of the aforesaid investment, Firema Trasporti was allegedly de facto subjected to an abuse of economic dependence from the abovementioned Leonardo Group in performing the various agreements existing with AnsaldoBreda. In both proceedings Leonardo and AnsaldoBreda appeared before the court requesting that, on the merits, the claims submitted against them be dismissed as clearly groundless as of fact and as of right. • The proceedings brought by Mr Pio Deiana before the Rome Court of Appeal – which were discontinued due to his subsequent death – have been resumed by one of the heirs within the prescribed time limits. Following the hearing held on 26 January 2022, the Court noting a lack of documentation attesting to the claimant’s capacity as heir of the deceased person, adjourned the case to the hearing of 4 May 2022 requesting that, in the meantime, such documentation be supplemented. It should be noted that in 2013 Pio Maria Deiana, on his own account and in his capacity as Director of Janua Dei S.r.l. and of Società Progetto Cina S.r.l., brought proceedings, before the Court of Rome, against Leonardo in order to ask the Court to rule the invalidity of the settlement agreement signed in 2000 by the aforesaid companies and the then-Ansaldo Industria, assuming that it was allegedly concluded based on unfair conditions. The claim was submitted against Leonardo, on the basis of the latter’s alleged general liability in the capacity as the parent company of Ansaldo Industria at the time of the events being disputed. The damages being sought, to be determined during the course of the proceedings, are estimated at €mil. 2,700. By a judgment dated 31 May 2018, the Court rejected the plaintiff’s claim. • the case involved in the action brought before the Court of Rome by Selex Service Management (now Selex ES S.p.A. in liquidation) against the Ministry of the Environment, Land and Sea (now the Ministry for Ecological Transition) in relation to the performance of the Sistri contract. By a judgment published on 20 January 2022, the Court of Rome ordered the Ministry to settle the invoices that had not yet been paid and related to the variable quota set out as per contract for an amount of about €mil. 80 (in addition to VAT) plus interest. The Company and the Ministry have mutually agreed to let the time limit for the appeal to elapse (25 February 2022) as part of a broader settlement agreement that will be further formalised in the coming months. It should be noted that the Sistri contract was signed between the Ministry of Ecological Transition and Selex Service Management in December 2009 in relation to the design, operation and maintenance of the System for Waste Tracking until 30 November 2014. • Within the dispute pending between Augusta Westland International Ltd. and the Indian Ministry of Defence in relation to the supply contract for 12 helicopters signed in 2010, worth around €mil. 560 in total, the Company - before proceeding with the ordinary court hearing to determine jurisdiction as an alternative to the arbitration proceedings that had been in the meantime abandoned – filed a mandatory request for the initiation of mediation proceedings under the Commercial Courts Act of 2015, which was not accepted by the Ministry. Pending the initiation of ordinary proceedings before the Indian Civil Courts, the Ministry did not confirm the ban on the Leonardo group entering the Indian market, which is why it is no longer considered convenient or consistent to bring an action against the local Government. * * * * * * * *

Moreover, given their complexity, their cutting-edge technological content and the nature of the customers, the Group’s long-term contracts are sometimes affected by disputes with customers in relation to the compliance of works with customer specifications and product performances. The Group adjusts the estimated contract costs for foreseeable issues, also taking into account the possible developments in the relevant disputes. With regard to contracts in progress affected by uncertainties and issues under discussion with customers, there are: • by a request for arbitration filed on 25 October 2019, Leonardo S.p.a. and PSC S.p.A. (collectively referred to as “LP” unincorporated joint venture,) initiated arbitration proceedings against Galfar Misnad Engineering & Contracting W.L.L., Salini-Impregilo S.p.A. (now Webuild) and Cimolai S.p.A. (collectively referred to “GSIC” unincorporated joint venture) to seek an order imposing them to pay, among others, the fees that were still unpaid and any additional costs relating to the subcontract that had been entered into between the parties on 22 September 2016, whereby GSIC appointed LP to provide supplies and carry out certain manufacturing operations. These electrical, mechanical and plumbing plant engineering works are included in the general contract, awarded to GSIC, for the design and construction of the Al Bayt Stadium in Al Khor City (Qatar). The regular progress of the subcontracted works was strongly affected by a number of delays not attributable to LP, as well as by numerous additions and variations to the works that had been initially agreed and the shortcomings of the technical documentation prepared by GSIC. On the other hand, the latter submitted allegations to the contrary, while also charging LP with having caused damage to its organisation. In this context, on a preliminary basis LP asked the court to order GSIC to pay the remaining instalments of the fees initially envisaged in the subcontract, as well as any and all additional costs incurred for a total of QARmil. 1,432 (about €mil. 347 at 20 January 2022). On the other hand, GSIC contested any charges and asked the court, on a counterclaim basis, to order LP to compensate for any damage the latter had allegedly caused, for a total of QARmil. 755 (about €mil. 183 at 20 January 2022). From a procedural point of view, the phase for the exhibition of documents between the parties was completed in December 2021 following an initial exchange of briefs and statements (including the Memorial of claim submitted by LP in November 2020 and the subsequent Memorial of defence and counterclaim submitted by GSIC in July 2021). Additional statements of defence are expected to be filed during the first half of 2022, while the hearing for arbitration proceedings is currently scheduled on the days from 4 to 15 July 2022. Finally, the award is expected to be issued in February 2023, after a final exchange of statements of claim and reply, according to the procedural schedule that is currently in force between the parties.
23. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS. 
The classification of employee benefit obligations is affected by the net balance, per each plan, of the plan assets and liabilities. The Group recognised on its balance sheet the liabilities (net of related plan assets) as well as the assets (net of related liabilities), depending on whether the plans are in a deficit or surplus position.
Net assets under defined-benefit plans are classified among other non-current assets (Note 13) and other long-term benefits are classified under other non-current liabilities (note 24). Below is a breakdown of the net liabilities and assets:

The change in defined-benefit plans was mainly due to the plans applicable in the United Kingdom. In particular, the increase in the discount rate reduced liabilities and returns on plan assets were higher than those expected.
Below is a breakdown of defined-benefit plans and statistical information regarding the excess (deficit/surplus) of the plans: 31 December 2020 31 December 2021.

The main actuarial assumptions used in the valuation of defined-benefit plans and of the portion of severance pay provision that has maintained the nature of defined-benefit plan are as follows:


 
217. 
Consolidated Financial Statements at 31 December 2021. 
Severance pay provision Defined-benefit plans 31 December 2020 31 December 2021 
31 December 2020 31 December 2021. 
Discount rate (annual) 0.4% 0.7% 1,45% - 3,02% 1,95% - 2,91%
Rate of salary increase n.a. n.a. 2,10% - 3,20% 3,20% - 3,80%
Inflation rate 0.4% 1.4% 1,50% - 3,10% 2,80% - 2,95% 
The discount rate utilised to discount the defined benefits plans is determined with reference to expected returns of the AA-rated bonds. The sensitivity analysis for each significant actuarial assumption, which shows the effects on bonds in absolute value, is as follows:
Severance pay provision Defined-benefit plans 
31 December 2020 31 December 2021 31 December 2020 31 December 2021 -0.25% +0.25% -0.25% +0.25% -0.25% +0.25% -0.25% +0.25%

Inflation rate (2) 3 (2) 2 (102) 111 (110) 115. 
The average duration of the severance pay is about 5 years while that of the other defined-benefit plans is 20 years.
The estimate of the contributions to be paid in 2022 related to defined-benefit plans is about €mil. 54.
As regards the strategies of correlation of assets and liabilities in defined-benefit plans, there is the prevalence of investing in diversified assets in order to limit the negative impact, if any, on the total return on the plan assets. Assets of defined-benefit plans include: 31 December 2020 31 December 2021.

Other financial income and expenses 6 (38) (32) 22 (35) (13) 147 (414) (267) 137 (309) (172) 

The decrease in net financial expenses was mainly due to lower interest charges deriving from the redemption of the bond issue in January 2021 and lower premiums paid on forwards, thanks to the significant narrowing of the spread between the Euro and US dollar rate curves.
More specifically: • net interest decreased by €mil. 30. The item includes €mil. 98 (€mil. 125 in 2020) related to interest on bonds; • the expenses arising from the application of fair value break down as follows:

33. ASSETS HELD FOR SALE AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS. 
Following the sale of the Vitrociset space business unit to Telespazio, as at 31 December 2021 assets classified as held for sale are entirely represented by fixed assets owned by Leonardo Global Solutions held for disposal. As detailed in the Annual Financial Report at 31 December 2020, to which reference is made, the space business of Vitrociset S.p.A. and that of its investees (Vitrociset Belgium S.p.r.l. and Vitrociset France S.a.r.l.) was intended for a contribution transaction in favour of the Space Alliance (in particular Telespazio S.p.A.). Therefore, the value of the assets and liabilities held for sale included, as at 31 December 2020, the values of the abovementioned space business unit for a net amount of €mil. 38, plus the value of the fixed assets owned by Leonardo Global Solutions that were held for sale for €mil. 9.

Trade receivables are commented on later, along with revenue from related parties. Current loans and receivables and other current payables to related parties mainly refer to receivables and payables from/to joint ventures and payables for subscribed capital unpaid to be paid towards Leonardo Helicopteres Algerie for €mil. 20. The financial exposure to Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (€mil. 100) relates to the loan taken out in 2020 in support of investments in R&D and innovation set out in the Industrial Plan. Trade payables to associates mainly related to the relations with Gulf System Logistic Services Company W.L.L, which showed a decrease following the completion of the infrastructures built in Kuwait and to the failure to start logistic support activities, within the EFA Kuwait programme. Current loans and borrowings from related parties include in particular the amount of €mil. 664 (€mil. 663 at 31 December 2020) due by Group companies to the joint venture MBDA and payables of €mil. 37 (€mil. 45 at 31 December 2020), to Eurofighter, 21% owned. As regards the latter, under a cash pooling agreement its surplus cash and cash equivalents are distributed among the partners.

The most significant trade receivables and revenues, in addition to those from joint ventures, are related to companies and consortia: • Eurofighter Jagdflugzeug GmbH in the scope of the EFA Kuwait aeronautical programme; • NH Industries in the scope of the NH90 helicopter programme; • Iveco - Oto Melara for production and post-sales assistance on defence and security ground vehicles (mainly VBM Freccia for the Italian Army); • Trade receivables from Macchi Hurel Dubois for the sale of nacelles are no longer reported since they were less than €mil. 10, the slight decrease in revenues is linked to lower deliveries; • Subsidiaries or companies subject to significant influence on the part of the Ministry of Economy and Finance, including relations with Ferrovie dello Stato for the provision of ETR 700 trains, with CDP for supplies to subsidiary Fincantieri and with ENAV for the supply of systems and software components for flight assistance.


 
230. 
Consolidated Financial Statements at 31 December 2021. 
Costs related to those to Joint Ventures, as well as to companies: • Eurofighter Jagdflugzeug GmbH and Gulf System Logistic Services Company W.L.L. for operations within the EFA/Kuwait programme; the increase in costs to Eurofighter in the comparative period was due to the delivery of major components for the assembly and mounting on aircraft intended for the Kuwait customer while the decrease in costs to Gulf reflects what already described in the comment on trade payables; • Subsidiaries or companies subject to significant influence by the Ministry of Economy and Finance, including those to Enel.
37. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT. 
The Leonardo Group is exposed to financial risks associated with its operations, specifically related to these types of risks: • interest-rate risks, related to the Group’s financial exposure; • exchange-rate risks, related to operations in currencies other than the reporting currency; • liquidity risks, relating to the availability of financial resources and access to the credit market; • credit risks, resulting from normal commercial transactions or financing activities.
Leonardo carefully and specifically follows each of these financial risks, with the objective of promptly minimising them, even using hedging derivatives.
The sections below provide an analysis, conducted through sensitivity analysis, of the potential impact on the final results deriving from assumed fluctuations in reference parameters. As required by IFRS 7, these analyses are based on simplified scenarios applied to the final results of the reference periods and, by their own nature, they cannot be considered as indicators of the actual effects of future changes in reference parameters with different financial statements and market conditions, and cannot reflect the inter-relations and the complexity of reference markets.
Interest rate risk. 
The Leonardo Group is exposed to interest rate risk on borrowings. The management of interest rate risk is consistent with the long-standing practice of reducing the risk of fluctuations in interest rates while seeking to minimise related borrowing costs.
In this regard, it should be noted that borrowings at 31 December 2021, equal to €mil. 5,670, included the value of lease liabilities equal to €mil. 568 and payables to related parties.
The amount of fixed-rate borrowings from banking and lending institutions (excluding lease liabilities and loans and borrowings with Group’s companies), also through the use of hedging instruments, amounts to about 71%, and, consequently, the floating-rate percentage is around 29%. Therefore, at the date of these financial statements, the interest-rate risk exposure continued to be moderate, with a variable exposure component which allows, at the current market conditions, the debt cost to be reduced, bringing it to about 2.8% with an average life of about 4.2 years. It should be noted that, following the Group’s repayment of the bond issue expired in January 2022 the cost of debt showed a further decrease, reaching a value of about 2.3% with an average term of about 5 years and a variable rate amount increased up to 34%.
At 31 December 2021, the transactions were the following: • options for €mil. 200 (CAP at 4.20% and Knock out at 5.60% in relation to the 6-month Euribor interest rate), originally purchased in order to partially cover the bond issue due 2025. Moreover, given the low cost, it is currently deemed appropriate not to settle the transaction, in order to use it in the event


 
231. 
Consolidated Financial Statements at 31 December 2021 of the Group’s strategy providing for a return to the floating rate and the levels of said rate should become unfavourable; • floating/fixed interest rate swap for €mil. 300 relating to the EIB loan in the same amount, which guarantees a fixed rate of 1.82% on the loan.
The detail of the main outstanding interest-rate swaps is as follows:

Exchange rate risk Transaction risk Due to its commercial operations, the Group’s companies are exposed to the risk of fluctuations in the currencies related to those cases in which orders, revenue and costs are expressed in currencies other than the functional one used in the financial statements (specifically, US dollars and, to a lesser extent, the pound sterling). Exchange rate risk management is governed by the directive in force within the Group. The purpose of the directive is to standardise management criteria based on industrial-not-speculative strategies so as to contain risks within specific limits by carefully and constantly assessing all foreign currency transaction positions. The methodology adopted calls for the systematic hedging of commercial cash flows resulting from the assumption of contractual commitments that are certain or highly probable as either buyer or seller, thereby ensuring current exchange rates at the date of acquisition of multi-year contracts and neutralising the effects of exchange-rate fluctuations. As a result, contracts for purchases or sales denominated in a currency different from the functional currency are hedged using forward contracts of amounts, maturities, and key parameters that are similar to the underlying position. The Group defines the existence of an economic relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item on the basis of the currency, amounts and respective cash flows and assesses whether the derivative designated in each hedging relationship will be and has been effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged item. In the event that, due to their nature or following events that entail their ineffectiveness, derivative instruments held in the portfolio should be found to no longer be a hedge, the fair value of the instrument is recognised through profit and loss according to accounting principles. In the event the designation of the instrument as a hedge

Consolidated Financial Statements at 31 December 2021 should continue to be supported, the cash-flow hedge accounting method of recognition is adopted (Note 4.3). Leonardo carries out these transactions with banks in its own interest and of Group companies. At 31 December 2021 the Leonardo Group had outstanding foreign exchange transactions totalling €mil. 9.846 (notional amount). Overall, the average euro/US dollar exchange rate for hedging purposes is 1.149 on sales and about 1.157 on purchases.

Translation risk The Group is exposed to “translation risk”, i.e. the risk that assets, liabilities and results in consolidated companies whose reporting currency is not the euro (mainly USD and GBP) can have different values in euros depending on the performance of exchange rates, which affect the equity reserve named “Translation reserve” (Note 20) and results of operations. It should be noted that Leonardo does not hedge translation risk relating to its own equity investments, the most important of which are in the USA and in the UK.


 
233. 
Consolidated Financial Statements at 31 December 2021. 
Leonardo UK Ltd., which is Leonardo’s main equity holding in the UK had a positive net financial position which is transferred to Leonardo through cash pooling arrangements. Leonardo systematically hedges this exposure through exchange-rate derivatives recognised as fair value hedges. As a result, even though the Group has no economic exposure, it is subject to balance-sheet volatility directly impacting the amount of Group net debt, which is affected by the realigning payables/receivables in foreign currency from third parties or, similarly, by the cash effects deriving from the renewal of hedges. The effects on the equity of the Group, broken down by the main currencies, are reported in Note 20.
Liquidity risk The Group is exposed to the risk of not being able to finance the prospective requirements deriving from its usual business and investment operations, as well as those connected with the volatility of the relevant markets and with operations linked to commercial contracts for which there is the risk of renegotiation or cancellation. Furthermore, there is the risk of not being able to repay or refinance debts at the expiry dates. In order to face these risks the Leonardo Group has at its disposal, for financing its operations: • the cash and cash equivalents of €mil. 2,479 generated at 31 December 2021 related to Leonardo S.p.a. (€mil. 1,875) and to Group companies that, for different reasons, do not fall within the scope of the cash pooling system (€mil. 573), in addition to temporarily available cash amounts of the companies falling, directly or indirectly, within the scope of the cash pooling, as well as to deposits made for different reasons; • an ESG-linked Revolving Credit Facility (RCF), available to Leonardo S.p.a., amounting to €bil. 2.4, comprising a 5-year tranche of €bil. 1.8 expiring in September 2026 and a 3-year tranche of €mil. 600 expiring in September 2024. Both the RCF tranches had been entirely unused at 31 December 2021; • uncommitted bank credit lines totalling €mil. 810 (entirely unused at 31 December 2021); • short-term credit lines subject to revocation in US dollars, available to subsidiary Leonardo US Holding and guaranteed by Leonardo S.p.a., for an overall countervalue of €mil. 221 (entirely unused at 31 December 2021); • unconfirmed lines of credit for guarantees for a total amount of €mil. 10,324, of which an amount of €mil. 3,750, available at 31 December 2021; • the EMTN (Euro Medium Term Note) Programme, out of which all the bonds of Leonardo S.p.a. were issued, which are currently in place on the Euromarket and which had been used for a total nominal amount of €mil. 2,156 at 31 December 2021, compared to a total amount of €mil. 4,000 under the programme.
Credit risk. 
The Group is exposed to credit risk, which is defined as the probability of an insolvency with respect to a credit position with commercial and financial counterparties.
Regarding commercial transactions, the most significant programmes are made with public sector contractors or contractors belonging to public institutions, mainly in the Euro area, in the UK, the US and the Middle East. The risks associated with the counterparty, for contracts with countries for which there are no usual commercial relations, are analysed and valued at the time of the offer in order to highlight and mitigate insolvency risks, if any. While solvency is guaranteed with public-entity customers, collection times are longer (in some countries they are significantly longer) than for other business sectors, creating significant outstanding credit positions and the subsequent need for transactions to convert the receivables into cash. When possible, the Group hedges against potential defaults of its customers by entering into insurance policies with leading Export Credit Agencies (ECAs) internationally and with major Italian agencies (eg. SACE).


 
234. 
Consolidated Financial Statements at 31 December 2021. 
The types of contracts entered into by the Group provide for sizeable retention money withheld by customers, as well as back-to-back clauses in case of sub-supplies. All this inherently extends the times for collection of outstanding receivables.
Furthermore, the Group operates in markets which are or have been recently affected by geopolitical or financial tensions. In particular, with reference to the situation at 31 December 2021, we note the following relations with countries exposed to credit risk according to the international institutions (SACE): 
€mil. Libia Zambia Turchia Turkmenistan Angola Other countries Total. 
Assets 23 5 72 27 92 75 294. 
Liabilities (30) (13) (127) (1) (87) (70) (328)
Net exposure (7) (8) (55) 26 5 5 (34) 
As at 31 December 2021, the countries identified by SACE as countries at risk included Ukraine, to which - as indicated in Note 7 to which reference should be made - the Group has no balance sheet exposures.
Finally, the receivables related to certain existing contracts, might not be paid, renegotiated or written off.
The table below summarises trade receivables, with most of the balance claimed, as indicated, from publicsector contractors or contractors belonging to public institutions: (€ billions) 31 December 2020 31 December 2021. 
Portion due 1.3 1.2 - of which: for more than 12 months 0.6 0.4. 
Portion not yet due 1.7 2.0. 
Total trade receivables 3.0 3.2. 

A part of the portion due is offset by a liability, in relation to payable items or provisions for risks on any net excesses.
Loans and receivables, amounting to €mil. 75 (€mil. 183 at 31 December 2020) include €mil. 14 (€mil. 16 at 31 December 2020) classified as “non-current” and consequently excluded from the net financial position. Loans and receivables are broken down in the table below: 
31 December 2020 31 December 2021. 
Loans and receivables from related parties 8 13. 
Other loans and receivables 8 1. 
Non-current loans and receivables 16 14. 
Loans and receivables from related parties 149 45. 
Other loans and receivables 18 16. 
Current loans and receivables 167 61. 
Total loans and receivables 183 75. 

Both the main trade and financial receivables are impaired based on their probability of default or individually in case of particular situations. Vice versa, for receivables that are not impaired individually, impairment provisions are accrued, using historical series, statistical data and probability of default on an aggregate basis also supported by qualitative analyses.
During the year, receivables were assigned without recourse for a total volume of €mil. 747 (€mil. 2,619 in 2020). The amount of the assignments is significantly lower than the previous year's figure, also thanks to an objective progressive improvement in the emergency situation during 2021, which has allowed the dynamics underlying the realisation of collection flows to be restored, linearising the flow trend.

Consolidated Financial Statements at 31 December 2021. 
Classification of financial assets and liabilities. 
The table below shows the fair value hierarchy for the financial assets and liabilities of the Group measured at fair value. The fair value of derivatives (classified under other current assets and liabilities) and of current securities is determined on the basis of measurement techniques which consider directly observable market inputs (the so-called “Level 2”). The fair value of the earn-out linked to the acquisition of Kopter was determined on the basis of measurement techniques which do not consider directly observable market inputs (the so-called “Level 3”), by discounting back the estimate of the variable amounts payable on the basis of the commercial performance of the programme.
31 December 2020 31 December 2021. 
Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 2 Level 3 Total. 
Other non-current assets - - - - - -
Other current assets 222 - 222 108 - 108. 
Other non-current liabilities - 17 17 - 17 17. 
Other current liabilities 172 - 172 161 - 161. 
The total fair value of pension plan assets amounted to €mil. 4,001 (€mil. 3,560 at 31 December 2020), classified under non-current assets and deducted from Employee benefits.
 38. REMUNERATION TO KEY MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL. 
Remuneration paid to persons who have strategic power and responsibility of Leonardo S.p.a. amounted to €mil. 10 (€mil. 9 at 31 December 2020). Remuneration paid to Directors, excluding managers with strategic responsibility, amounted to €mil. 2 (€mil. 2 in 2020). This figure includes fees and other compensation, pensions and other benefits, including the portion borne by the Company.
39. SHARE BASE PAYMENTS. 
In order to implement an incentive and retention system for the Group’s employees and associates, starting from 2015 Leonardo adopted incentive plans which provide for the assignment of Leonardo shares, subject to assessing the attainment of pre-set business targets. These shares will be awarded to the beneficiaries at the end of the vesting period, provided that they have met the condition of being still employed with the company. The cost recognised in the income statement for the share incentive plans amounted in 2021 to €mil. 9 (€mil. 10 in 2020).
With specific regard to the current Long-Term Incentive Plans, the fair value used to measure the portion linked to the performance indicators (Group Net Debt, ROS and starting from the three-year cycle 2021-2023 the Sustainability indicators) was equal to €10.25 (value of Leonardo shares at the grant date of 31 July 2018) with reference to the three-year cycle 2018-2020, it was equal to €11.04 (value of Leonardo shares at the grant date of 31 July 2019) with reference to the three-year cycle 2019-2021, to € 5.41 (value of Leonardo shares at the grant date of 31 July 2020) with reference to the three-year cycle 2020-2022 and to € 6.788 (value of Leonardo shares at the grant date of 31 July 2021) with reference to the three-year cycle 20212023.
Vice versa, the award of the remaining of the shares depends upon market conditions which affect the determination of the fair value (“adjusted fair value”). The adjusted fair value, calculated using the “Monte Carlo” method in order to simulate the possible performance of the stock and of the other companies within the basket, was equal to €3.51 with reference to the three-year cycle 2018-2020, it was equal to €6.72 with reference to the three-year cycle 2019-2021, to €1.73 with reference to the three-year cycle 2020-2022 and to €3.7 with reference to the three-year cycle 2021-2023.


 
236. 
Consolidated Financial Statements at 31 December 2021. 
The input data used to calculate the adjusted fair value were: • the stock price at the grant date; • the average share price in the three months preceding the performance period; • the risk-free interest rate based on the zero-coupon yield curve in 36 months; • the expected volatility of the price of Leonardo shares and of the shares of the other companies within the basket based on time series in the 36 months prior to the grant date; • correlation coefficients between Leonardo and the other companies within the basket on the basis of logarithms of the daily performance of the stocks in the 36 months prior to the grant date; • dividend distribution forecasts on a historical basis.
During 2021 the conditions for the granting of 133,560 shares under the long-term incentive plan have been met. For the Board of Directors The Chairman (Luciano Carta)

Independent auditor’s report pursuant to article 14 of Legislative Decree n. 39, dated January 27, 2010 and article 10 of EU Regulation n. 537/2014 (Translation from the original Italian text) To the Shareholders of Leonardo S.p.A. Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements Opinion. 
We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Leonardo Group (the Group), which comprise the statement of financial position as at December 31, 2021, the separate income statement, the statement of comprehensive income, the statement of cash flows and the statement of changes in equity for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Group as at December 31, 2021, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union and with the regulations issued for implementing art. 9 of Legislative Decree n. 38/2005. Basis for Opinion. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of Leonardo S.p.A. in accordance with the regulations and standards on ethics and independence applicable to audits of financial statements under Italian Laws. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Other matters The consolidated financial statements of Leonardo Group for the year ended December 31, 2020 were audited by another auditor who expressed an unmodified opinion on those statements on March 11, 2021. Key Audit Matters. 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We identified the following key audit matters:


2. 
Key Audit Matter Audit response. 
Recognition of revenues and losses from longterm contracts with customers. 

Revenues from long-term contracts with customers are recognized “over-time” using an input method for measuring progress towards complete satisfaction of performance obligations based on the percentage of completion obtained from the ratio of incurred costs on the total expected costs for the contract over the life of the project (cost to cost method). The estimation of the total expected project costs is, by its nature, complex and characterized by significant uncertainties as it may be impacted by many factors, including the ability to fulfill the obligations assumed towards customers, which may also result in penalties and additional expenses for significant amounts. Therefore, the estimate involves a high degree of judgment by Directors that may significantly affect the contract revenues recognition and any loss at completion in cases of negative margin expectation. Accordingly, we identified this area as a key audit matter. The disclosures related to the criteria applied for the recognition and measurement of revenues and margins on long-term contracts with customers are included in notes “3.9 Revenues and contract assets/liabilities with customers“ and “4.4 Estimate of revenues and final costs of long- term contracts”.
Our audit procedures in response to the key audit matter included, among others: • the understanding of the criteria applied for the recognition of revenues from long-term contracts with customers; • the assessment of the process and key controls over the recognition of revenues from long-term contracts with customers; • for a sample of contracts we performed: (i) testing of relevant contractual terms and conditions in order to verify whether those were adequately considered in management estimates; (ii) testing of the reasonableness of key assumptions underlying the estimation of the life-of-project costs based on inquiries, analysis of any communications with customers and comparative analysis; (iii) comparative analysis between actual figures and estimates made in previous periods in order to assess the accuracy of management’s forecasting; (iv) testing of incurred costs and their allocation to proper on-going contracts.
Lastly, we have reviewed the disclosures provided in the notes to the financial statements regarding this key audit matter.

Test of the recoverability of goodwill. 
Goodwill as at December 31, 2021 amounts to Euro 3.836 million. Directors tested for impairment the Cash Generating Units (CGUs) to which goodwill has been allocated in order to identify any impairment loss in respect of their recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of each CGU is. 
Our audit procedures in response to the key audit matter included, among others: • the assessment of the procedure applied in the performance of the impairment test as approved by the Directors; • testing of the criteria applied for identifying the CGUs and allocating relevant assets and liabilities to them; • the analysis of the expected cash flows of each CGU and testing of their


3 determined using the value in use method and it is based on complex assumptions that inherently involve a degree of judgment by Directors, with reference to the expected cash flows over the period considered in the Business Plan 20222026, to the estimate of the terminal value and the determination of the long-term growth and discount rates. Because of the judgement involved and the complexity of the assumptions underlying the estimation of the recoverable amount of goodwill, we identified this area as a key audit matter. Disclosures on the assumptions and the estimations adopted when performing the impairment test are included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements “4.6 Impairment of assets“ and “9 Intangible Assets”.
consistency with the expected cash flows resulting from the Business Plan 2022-2026; • the assessment of the reasonableness of the estimates made by Directors, also by comparing actual figures and estimates made in previous periods; • the assessment of the long-term growth and discount rates; • the assessment of the sensitivity analysis performed by Directors on key assumptions underlying the impairment test.

In performing our procedures we involved our experts in valuation techniques. Lastly, we have reviewed the disclosures provided in the notes to the financial statements regarding this key audit matter.
Recognition and subsequent measurement of non-recurring costs and development costs. 
Non-recurring costs and developments costs capitalized as intangible assets as at December 31, 2021 amount to an aggregate of Euro 2.609 million. The initial recognition of these assets and the subsequent assessment of their recoverability are based on complex assumptions that inherently involve a degree of judgment by Directors as influenced by many factors including the time horizon of the product business plans and management’s ability to forecast the commercial success of the underlying technologies. Because of the judgement involved and the complexity of the underlying assumptions, we identified this area as a key audit matter. Disclosures on the assumptions and the estimations adopted in the recognition and subsequent measurement of non-recurring costs and development costs are included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements “4.1 Research and development costs “, “4.2 Nonrecurring costs” and “9 Intangible assets”.
Our audit procedures in response to the key audit matter included, among others: • understanding of the processes applied in recognizing for non-recurring costs and development costs and the process related to the assessment of their recoverability, including the estimation of units of production to be sold and related expected cash flows; • for a sample of development programs we performed: (i) substantive procedures aimed at verifying internal and external costs recognized during the period; (ii) assessment of the reasonableness of key assumptions underlying the product business plans; (iii) testing of the discount rates; (iv) assessment of the sensitivity analysis performed by Directors on the key assumptions underlying the impairment test.
In performing our procedures we involved our experts in valuation techniques. Lastly, we have reviewed the disclosures provided in the notes to the financial statements


4 regarding this key audit matter.
Responsibilities of Directors and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
The Directors are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union and with the regulations issued for implementing art. 9 of Legislative Decree n. 38/2005 and, within the terms provided by the law, for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. The Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern and, when preparing the consolidated financial statements, for the appropriateness of the going concern assumption, and for appropriate disclosure thereof. The Directors prepare the consolidated financial statements on a going concern basis unless they either intend to liquidate the Parent Company Leonardo S.p.A. or to cease operations or have no realistic alternative but to do so. The statutory audit committee (Collegio Sindacale) is responsible, within the terms provided by the law, for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process. Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia), we have exercised professional judgment and maintained professional skepticism throughout the audit. In addition: • we have identified and assessed the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designed and performed audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtained audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control; • we have obtained an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control; • we have evaluated the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Directors; • we have concluded on the appropriateness of Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to consider this matter in forming our opinion. Our


5 conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company [the Group] to cease to continue as a going concern; • we have evaluated the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; • we have obtained sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We have communicated with those charged with governance, identified at an appropriate level as required by ISA Italia, regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. We have provided those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with the ethical and independence requirements applicable in Italy, and we have communicated with them all matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we have determined those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We have described these matters in our auditor’s report. Additional information pursuant to article 10 of EU Regulation n. 537/14. 
The Shareholders of Leonardo S.p.A., in the general meeting held on May 20, 2020, engaged us to perform the audits of the financial statements and consolidated financial statements for each of the years ending December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2029. We declare that we have not provided prohibited non-audit services, referred to article 5, par. 1, of EU Regulation n. 537/2014, and that we have remained independent of the Group in conducting the audit.

251. 
Separate Financial Statements at 31 December 2021. 
NOTES TO THE SEPARATE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AT 31 DECEMBER 2021 1. GENERAL INFORMATION. 
Leonardo S.p.a. is a company limited by shares based in Rome (Italy), at Piazza Monte Grappa 4, and is listed on the Italian Stock Exchange (FTSE MIB). The Company is a major Italian high technology organization operating in the Helicopters, Defence Electronics & Security and Aeronautics business sectors.
2. FORM, CONTENT AND APPLICABLE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS. 
In application of EU Regulation 1606/2002 of 19 July 2002, the financial statements at 31 December 2021 were prepared in accordance with the international accounting standards (IFRS) endorsed by the European Commission, supplemented by the relevant interpretations (Standing Interpretations Committee - SIC and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee - IFRIC) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and in force at the year-end. The general principle used in preparing these separate financial statements is the historical cost method, except for those items that, in accordance with IFRS, are obligatory recognised at fair value, as indicated in the valuation criteria of each item. The separate financial statements are composed of the separate income statement, the statement of comprehensive income, the statement of financial position, the statement of cash flows, the statement of changes in equity and the related notes to the financial statements. In consideration of the significant values, the figures in these notes are shown in millions of euros unless otherwise indicated. Among the options permitted by IAS 1, the Company has chosen to present its balance sheet by separating current and non-current items and its income statement by the nature of the costs. Instead, the statement of cash flows was prepared using the indirect method. The International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) used for preparing these separate financial statements, drawn up under the going-concern assumption, are the same that were used in the preparation of the separate financial statements at 31 December 2020 except for what indicated below (Note 4). Preparation of the separate financial statements required management to make certain valuations and estimates. The main areas affected by estimates or assumptions of particular importance or that have significant effects on the balances shown are described in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, to which reference is made. The Board of Directors of 10 March 2022 resolved to submit to shareholders the draft financial statements at 31 December 2021, authorizing their circulation, in the same venue and set the dates for the Ordinary Shareholders’ Meeting for 23 and 31 May 2022, on first and second call, respectively. The separate financial statements were prepared in accordance with IFRS and are subject to a statutory audit by EY S.p.A..
3. ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. 
The accounting policies and criteria are the same adopted, where applicable, for the annual consolidated financial statements, to which reference is made, except for the recognition and measurement of equity investment in subsidiaries, jointly controlled companies and associates recognised at their purchase or incorporation cost. In case of any impairment losses their recoverability is verified through the comparison between their carrying amount and the higher of their value in use that is determined by discounting prospective cash flows of the equity investment, where applicable, and the assumed sales value (fair value) which is determined on the basis of recent transactions or market multiples. The portion of losses (if any) exceeding the carrying amount is recognised through profit or loss in a specific provision under liabilities to


 
252. 
Separate Financial Statements at 31 December 2021 the extent that the Company states the existence of legal or implicit obligations to cover such losses, which are in any case within the limits of the book equity. If the impaired investee shows a subsequent improvement in performance which leads to believe that the reasons for the impairment cease to exist, the equity investments are revalued to the extent of the impairment losses recognised in previous periods under “adjustments to equity investments”. Dividends from subsidiaries and associates are recognised in the income statement in the year in which they are resolved. Finally, with reference to transactions between entities under joint control, which are not governed by IFRS, either from the point of view of the purchaser/assignee or from that of the seller/assignor, Leonardo recognises such transactions recognising directly in equity any gain on the transfer or sale of its subsidiaries. In the event the Group has evidence of an impairment loss of the investment, in excess of the amount accounted for under the equity method, the Group will proceed with calculating the impairment to be recorded in the income statement which is determined as the difference between the recoverable amount and the carrying amount of the investment. The fair value of equity investments, in the event this method applies, is calculated based on the bid price of the last trading day of the month for which the IFRS report was prepared, or based on financial valuation techniques for not listed instruments. Investments available for sale, like those acquired with the sole purpose of being disposed within the subsequent twelve months, are classified separately within “assets held for sale”.
4. EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES ADOPTED. 
In August 2020, the IASB published, in response to the reform of inter-bank offered rates (IBOR), the document “Interest Rate and Benchmark Reform – Phase 2” containing amendments to the following standards: IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16. All amendments entered into force on 1 January 2021. The adoption of these amendments did not impact the Company’s financial statements. On 31 March 2021, the IASB issued “Covid-19- Related Rent Concessions beyond 30 June 2021 (Amendment to IFRS 16)” whereby it extended for one year the period of application of the amendment to IFRS 16 issued in 2020 regarding the recognition of Covid-19-related rent concessions granted to lessees. The changes introduced by this new amendment are applicable beginning from 1 April 2021 however not impacting on the Company’s financial statements.
5. SIGNIFICANT EVENTS ON TRANSACTIONS DURING THE YEAR. 
Within the scope of the strategic/corporate rationalisation project of certain Company assets with a view to a more efficient and effective operation of industrial activities, the following industrial transactions are worth noting: - Acquisition of GEM Elettronica. On 27 January 2021 Leonardo signed a contract with GEM Investment S.r.l. and two minority quotaholders in order to acquire 30% of GEM Elettronica S.r.l. ("GEM") for a consideration of €mil. 5. The company operates in the field of short- and medium-range sensors, navigation radar and coastal surveillance, which are a business that is highly complementary to the Group's products. Under a call / put option scheme, Leonardo will also be entitled to become the majority shareholder (from 65% to 100%) within 3 to 6 years. The closing of the transaction took place on 14 April 2021; - Cooperation agreement with CAE. On 29 March 2021 Leonardo sold to Cae Aviation Training B.V. (CAE) 50% of its shares in “Leonardo CAE Advanced Jet Training”, a company previously wholly owned by Leonardo and providing support services to the operations of the International Flight Training School (IFTS), ranging from technical and logistics support to M-346 aircraft and Ground-Based Training Systems to the operation of IFTS infrastructures;


 
253. 
Separate Financial Statements at 31 December 2021 - Acquisition of di Hensoldt AG. On 24 April 2021 Leonardo entered into an agreement with Square Lux Holding II S.à r.l., a company controlled by funds advised by Kohlberg Kravis & Roberts & Co. L.P., to purchase a 25.1% stake in Hensoldt AG. The company is the leading German player in the field of sensor solutions for defence and security applications, as confirmed by the recent important contracts acquired (e.g. EFA, Pegasus), and it already had a consolidated collaboration relationship with Leonardo in significant programmes such as EFA, MALE, IFF. The completion of the transaction, which entailed an outlay of about €mil. 606 (net of transaction costs), took place on 3 January 2022; - Acquisition of ALEA. On 8 June 2021 Leonardo signed a preliminary agreement for the acquisition of 70% of the share capital of Alea S.p.A., a company specializing in mission critical communication software for multimedia solutions compliant with international standards on LTE/5G broadband networks. Leonardo, thanks to this transaction, strengthens its offering portfolio in professional communications, in order to guarantee new features and advanced performances in support of emergency management, public safety, companies, critical infrastructures and transports. The closing of the transaction took place on 3 August 2021, with a total outlay of about €mil. 3; - Merger by incorporation of Vitrociset. On 30 September 2021 the Board of Directors of Leonardo approved the merger of Vitrociset S.p.A. by incorporation into the Company. The transaction became effective from 1 January 2022 - including for accounting and tax purposes – and marked the completion of the integration process between the two companies that had been started in 2019 with the acquisition of the entire capital of Vitrociset.
During the 2021 financial year, the following financial transactions were carried out: - in January 2021 Leonardo used an amount of €mil. 200 of the loan taken out with the European Investment Bank (EIB) in December 2020, aimed at supporting some investment projects envisaged in the Group’s industrial plan; moreover, it proceeded with the early cancellation, which had been requested at the end of December 2020, of the remaining amount of about €mil. 250 of the Term Loan taken out with a pool of international banks during the Covid-19 emergency period in May 2020. Finally, it repaid the remaining portion (€mil. 739) of the bond issue of January 2015 for an initial amount of €mil. 950, which had reached its natural expiry; - in June the EMTN (Euro Medium Term Note) programme was renewed for further 12 months, which regulates possible bond issues on the European market for a maximum nominal value of €bil. 4. At the date of this report, the Programme is used for a total of €bil. 2.2; - in October 2021 Leonardo entered, with a pool of international and national banks, into an ESG-linked Revolving Credit Facility agreement for an amount of €bil. 2.4, structured into a 5-year term tranche of €bil. 1.8 and a 3-year term tranche of €mil. 600. The new credit facility replaces the two existing Revolving Credit Facilities – amounting to €mil. 1,800 and €mil. 1,250 –, which have been cancelled at the same time, thus reducing the overall cost of the borrowing available to meet the Group’s financial requirements and extending its term until 2026. The ESG-linked Revolving Credit Facility is subject to the same financial covenants as are already provided for in the other agreements signed by Leonardo. In line with the sustainability strategy of Leonardo, the new credit facility is linked for the first time to specific ESG indicators, including the reduction of CO2 emissions through eco-efficiency of industrial processes and the promotion of female employment with STEM degrees. The aforesaid ESG indicators also contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which are behind about 50% of the Group's investments. The achievement of ESG-linked targets will trigger an adjustment to the margin applied to the credit facility;


 
254. 
Separate Financial Statements at 31 December 2021 - in December 2021 Leonardo entered, with a pool of national and international banks, into an ESG-linked Term Loan facility for an amount of €mil. 600, with a term of 5 years and expiring at the beginning of 2027, aimed at repaying a bond maturing in January 2022. The credit facility is linked to specific ESG indicators, which are already included in the aforesaid ESG-linked Revolving Credit Facility (RCF-ESG) signed in October; in this case too, the achievement of the ESG-linked targets will trigger an adjustment to the margin applied to the credit facility. Other transactions: - during 2021 the Company made use of the tax concession provided for by article 110 of Legislative Decree 104/2020 as amended to realign the tax values of goodwill to the higher book value. In June 2021 the Company paid the first of the 3 annual instalments of the substitute tax, totally amounting to about €mil. 18, calculated on the value to realign for tax purposes for €mil. 614. As a result of the realignment, equal to €mil. 696, the goodwill book value acquires full tax relevance and becomes tax deductible over 50 years. The exercise of the realignment option requires to set aside a reserve subject to tax relief for tax purposes for €mil. 595, equal to the amount of the realignment net of the substitute tax. For a detail of the reserves at issue, reference is made to table no. 7. Considering the occurred realignment of the said values Leonardo derecognised the deferred tax liabilities priorly recorded and recognized a benefit of €mil. 45 through profit or loss; - taking into account the mid-term impacts of the pandemic on the civil sector and considering the changed prospects for the commercial aviation market, as set out in the Integrated Annual Report 2020, Leonardo has embarked on the announced actions aimed at mitigating the impact on the industrial performance of the Aerostructures Division. In this context, on 21 July 2021 trade union agreements were signed to make operational the instruments identified for the early retirement of employees on a voluntary basis. Such agreements will involve up to 390 employees who will meet the criteria for early retirement in the threeyear period 2021-2023, with an estimated cost of around €mil. 71.
6. SIGNIFICANT POST-BALANCE SHEET EVENTS. 
As part of the mentioned projects for more efficient and effective operations of Leonardo’s manufacturing activities, it should be noted that on 1 January 2022 the legal, accounting and tax effects commenced to run for the merger by incorporation into Leonardo S.p.a. of Vitrociset S.p.A.. In January 2022, the bond issued for €mil. 556 in December 2009 was repaid, having reached its natural expiry. It should also be noted that, Leonardo took steps to pay an amount of €mil. 606, net of transaction costs, for the acquisition of a stake in Hensoldt AG, at €23 per share, as detailed in the section on Industrial Transactions. As indicated in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, following the offensive launched by the Russian government against Ukraine, profound changes in the context of the world's geopolitical and economic equilibrium are looming up. Leonardo currently has no significant exposure to these two countries. Specifically, the balance sheet exposure at 31 December 2021 to Ukraine is zero and the net balance sheet exposure to operators directly affected by the sanction regime against Russia is approximately €mil. 30. The order backlog with Russia is about €mil. 25, while the backlog with Ukraine is about €mil. 8.

Separate Financial Statements at 31 December 2021. 
As set out in Note 4.1 of the consolidated financial statements, to which reference should be made, impairment tests on development costs and non-recurring costs are carried out – if conditions obtain- using the discounted cash flow method. The cash flows used are those of the product business plans, discounted on the basis of a WACC rate determined by applying the Capital Asset Pricing Model.
Goodwill Goodwill is allocated to the Cash Generating Units (CGUs) or groups of CGUs concerned, which are determined with reference to the Group’s organisational, management and control structure coinciding, as is known, with the Group’s three business segments. At the recognition of the mergers and demergers occurred in 2016 within the creation of the One Company, the goodwill was allocated, in accordance with the principle of “continuity of values”, to the same CGUs as those in the Consolidated Financial Statements, differentiating the part of goodwill related to net assets recognised line-by-line from that related to foreign equity investments, for which goodwill was recognised on the basis of the investments’ values. The breakdown of goodwill recognised by business sector at 31 December 2021 is as follows: 31 december 2020 31 december 2021. 
Helicopters 459 459. 
Defense Electronics & Security 188 188. 
Aeronautics 60 60 707 707. 
Goodwill is tested for impairment in order to determine any possible loss in value, making reference to the CGU as a whole, including, in accordance with the organisational and operational model, the equity investments falling within the scope of consolidation, which are then included and tested in the same year as the impairment. Therefore, only the equity investments that are not tested together with goodwill are subject to an impairment test separately, if required. The test is done by individual CGU by comparing the carrying amount with the greater of the value in use of the CGU and amount recoverable by sale (fair value). In practice, the Company has established an operational hierarchy between calculating the fair value net transaction costs and value in use, where the value in use is estimated first, and then only after, if it is lower than the carrying value, is the fair value net of transaction costs determined. In particular, the value in use is measured by the unlevered discounting of the cash flows resulting from the Group’s five-year business plans prepared by the CGU’s management and incorporated into the plan approved by Leonardo’s Board of Directors, projected beyond the explicit time horizon covered by the plan according to the perpetuity growth method (terminal value), using growth rates (“g-rate”) no greater than those forecast for the markets in which the given CGU operates. The cash flows used were those provided for in the plans adjusted to exclude the effects of any future business restructurings, not yet approved, or future investments for improving future performance. Specifically, these cash flows are those generated before financial expense and taxes – determined on a notional basis - and include investments in capital assets and monetary changes in working capital, while excluding cash flows from financial management, extraordinary events or the payment of dividends. The basic macro-economic assumptions were made on the basis of external information sources, where available, while the profitability and growth estimates used in the plans were calculated by management based on past experience and expected prospective developments in the markets in which the Company operates. These cash flows are discounted on a weighted-average cost of capital (WACC) basis calculated using the Capital Asset Pricing Model method. The following factors were taken into account in calculating WACCs, which were also determined using the data referable to the main competitors operating in each sector: • the risk-free rate was determined using the 10-year gross yield of government bonds of the geographic market of the CGU; • the market premium determined using the computations of external providers; • the sector beta;


 
257. 
Separate Financial Statements at 31 December 2021 • the cost of debt; • the debt/equity ratio.
On the contrary, the growth rates used to project the CGU’s cash flows beyond the explicit term of the plan were estimated by making reference to the growth assumptions of the individual sectors in which said CGUs operate. These assumptions are based on the internal processing of external sources, making reference to a period of time that is usually ten years. The g-rates used for the purposes of the impairment test were equal to 2%, consistently with the actions taken in previous financial years, even in the presence of higher expected growth rates in some sectors. Below are mostly important assumptions for the purposes of estimating the cash flows used in determining the value in use: • WACC; • g-rate; • ROS; • trend in Defence budgets.
In estimating these assumptions, the management made reference, in the case of external variables, to internal information processed on the basis of external surveys, as well as on its knowledge of the markets and of the specific contractual situations. The following WACCs and (nominal) growth rates were used at 31 December 2021 and 2020:

Defense Electronics & Security 6.2% 2.0% 6.1% 2.0%
Aeronautics 6.7% 2.0% 6.7% 2.0%
Testing revealed no signs of impairment but showed, on the contrary, significant positive margins (Headroom). Sensitivity analysis was conducted on the results of the tests, making reference to the assumptions for which it is reasonable to believe that a change in the same may significantly modify the results of the test. The wide positive margins recorded in all sectors are such that they may not be significantly modified by any changes in the assumptions described above. In any case, the results for all CGUs are reported below for information purposes. The table below shows, for the 2021 and 2020 financial years, the headroom relating to the base scenario, compared with the results of the following sensitivity analyses: (i) increase by 50 basis points in the interest rate used to discount cash flows across all the CGUs, other conditions being equal; (ii) reduction by 50 basis points in the growth rate used in calculating the terminal value, other conditions being equal; (iii) reduction by half point in the operating profitability applied to the terminal value, other conditions being equal. 31 december 2020 Margin (base case) Margin post sensitivity.

Separate Financial Statements at 31 December 2021. 
Development costs and non-recurring charges The item “development costs” mainly related to Helicopters (€mil. 198) and Defence Electronics & Security (€mil. 195) divisions. Investments for the year related in particular to Defence Electronics & Security (€mil. 49) and Helicopters (€mil. 26). The investments for the year relating to “Non-recurring costs” mainly refer to the Helicopters (€mil. 73) Defence Electronics & Security (€mil.31) and Aeronautics (€mil. 11) sectors. As regards programmes that benefit from the provisions of Law 808/85 and that are classified as functional to national security, the portion of capitalised non-recurring costs, pending the fulfilment of the legal requirements for the classification under receivables, is separately classified among “other non-current assets” (Note 12). The related amount is calculated on the basis of the Management’s estimate that takes account of both reasonable certainty of obtaining grants and the effects arising from time value in the event that, once they have been obtained, they are deferred over more than one financial period. Receivables for grants assessed by the grantor in relation to capitalised costs (shown here net of the related grants) are illustrated in Note 28. The impairment of non-recurring costs mainly refers to the write-down non-recurring costs linked to programmes in the Defence Electronics & Security sector. Impairment tests of non-recurring costs and development costs are performed on the most significant programmes in terms of capitalisation or risk or when impairment indicators emerge. Total research and development costs, including also “non-recurring costs” and “development costs” just mentioned, amount to €mil. 1,105 at 31 December 2021 (€mil. 1,077 at 31 December 2020), of which €mil. 149 expensed (€mil. 136 at 31 December 2020).
Concessions Licenses and Trademarks The item “Concessions, licenses and trademarks” rose by €mil. 173, after amortisation, mainly as a result of the agreement entered into in December 2021 by and between Leonardo and the subsidiary Agustawestland Philadelphia Corporation governing the acquisition, for €mil. 176, of the license granted by Bell Helicopter Textron Inc. linked to the sale of the AW609 tiltrotor.
Other intangible assets “Other assets” mainly include software, intangible assets in progress and advances.

During 2021 this item showed a decrease of €mil. 77 mainly as a result of the amortisation for the period. The Company has opted to exclude from the scope of application, the leases with a term of less than 12 months and those concerning assets of modest value, the effects of which were therefore recognised among “costs for purchases”. At 31 December 2021 acquisition commitments were in place for short-term leases for €mil. 4 (€mil. 3 at 31 December 2020).

This item showed a decrease of €mil. 154 compared to 2020, mainly as a result of a reduction in derivative assets which decreased by €mil. 121 mainly due to the fluctuations in the Euro/US Dollar exchange rates as well as to the decrease in the volume of derivative assets essentially attributable to the civil component. The decrease from related parties is commented on in Note 34. The changes during the year and the composition of assets by currency and geographical area are shown in Appendices nos. 5 and 6 to these Notes.

The item decreased on account of the repayment of the residual portion (€mil. 739) of the 2015 bonded loan of an original amount of €mil. 950 reaching its expiry date. The Company’s issues are governed by rules with standard legal clauses for these types of corporate transactions on institutional markets that do not require any undertaking with regard to compliance with specific financial parameters (financial covenants) but they do require negative pledge and cross-default clauses. Based on negative pledge clauses, the Company is expressly prohibited from pledging collateral security or other obligations to secure its debt in the form of bonds or listed financial instruments or financial instruments that qualify for listing, unless these guarantees are extended to all bondholders. Exceptions to this prohibition are securitisation and, as from July 2006, the establishment of assets for the use indicated in Article 2447-bis et seq. of the Italian Civil Code. On the contrary, the cross-default clauses give the


 
266. 
Separate Financial Statements at 31 December 2021 bondholders the right to request early redemption of the bonds in their possession in the event of default by the Company that results in a failure to make payment beyond pre-set limits.
Bank loans and borrowings The item includes loan agreements entered into with the European Investment Bank (EIB) amounting to: - €mil. 200 subscribed in December 2020 and used in January 2021, maturity date 2033; - €mil. 300 subscribed in 2018, maturity date 2031.
Both loans have been raised to finance investment projects provided for in the Group’s Industrial Plan. It should be also noted that the year saw the repayment of the last instalments (€mil. 46) of the 12-year EIB loan raised in 2009 aimed at development activities in the Aeronautics sector. The residual value of the total EIB loans amounted to €mil. 500 at 31 December 2021 (€mil. 393 at 31 December 2020). The item also includes the ESG-linked Term Loan facility raised and used in December 2021 equal to €mil. 600, with a duration of 5 years and maturity date the beginning of 2027 (See Note 5).
Related parties loans and borrowings Payables to related parties amounting to € mil. 2,584 increased by €mil167 compared to 31 December 2020. The item includes among others the loan agreement of €mil. 100 entered into in 2020 with Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP) aimed at co-financing some investment projects provided for in the Industrial Plan, which have already been 50% funded by the abovementioned European Investment Bank. This item also included lease liabilities for €mil. 437 (€mil. 496 at 31 December 2020). For a more detailed breakdown of payables to related parties, reference is made to Note 34.
Other financial debts The item includes the residual balance of subsidised loans, related to programmes and projects of the companies and business units merged. Exposure to changes in interest rates of the financial liabilities is as follows:

The amount of the provision for risks showed a decrease of €mil. 16 compared to the previous year. The provision for “restructuring” showed an increase of €mil. 29 and includes the effects of the early retirement schemes under Article 4 of Law 92/2012 (Fornero Act), provided for in the agreement signed with the national trade unions in July 2021 (see Note 5) and in 2018. “Other provisions for risks and charges” mainly include: • the provision for tax disputes of €mil. 54 (€mil. 55 at 31 December 2020); • the provision for litigation with employees and former employees of €mil. 24 (€mil. 25 at 31 December 2020); • the provision for litigation in progress of € mil. 2 (€mil. 2 at 31 December 2020); • provisions for critical issues on contracts equal to €mil. 292 (€mil. 336 at 31 December 2020), attributable in particular to the Aerostructures and Aircraft divisions.
With regard to risks, below is a summary of the criminal proceedings that are currently underway against Leonardo S.p.a., as well as certain former directors and executives, concerning acts committed during the performance of their duties at Leonardo S.p.a.. With specific reference to the events that occurred in 2021 and in early 2022: • On 22 May 2019 the Supreme Court rejected the appeals submitted against the judgment whereby on 8 January 2018 the Milan Court of Appeal had acquitted the former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Leonardo S.p.a. and the former Chief Executive Officer of AgustaWestland S.p.A. of the charges for the crimes under Articles 110, 112, paragraph 1, 318, 321 and 322-bis, paragraph 2(2) of the Italian Criminal

Separate Financial Statements at 31 December 2021. 
Code and Article 2 of Legislative Decree 74/2000, within the proceedings brought in relation to the supply of twelve AW 101 VIP/VVIP helicopters to the Indian Government. In respect of these companies, it is recalled that on 25 July 2014, pursuant to Article 58 of Legislative Decree 231/2001, the Public Prosecutor dismissed the proceedings against Leonardo, holding groundless, following the conclusion of investigations, the Company’s involvement from both a factual and legal point of view. The Prosecutor also acknowledged that since 2003 the Company has adopted, actually implemented and regularly updated an Organisational, Management and Control Model that is conceptually suitable to prevent offences like the one in question and is also focused on compliance processes as to guarantee adequate standards of fairness and ethical conduct. In addition, on 28 August 2014 the Judge for Preliminary Investigations (GIP, Giudice delle Indagini Preliminari) of the Court of Busto Arsizio – in granting the motions put forth by the companies – imposed administrative penalties pursuant to Article 63 of Legislative Decree 231/2001 and Article 444 and ff. of the Italian Code of Criminal Procedure, amounting to €80,000 for AgustaWestland S.p.A. and €300,000 for AgustaWestland Ltd, and ordered the confiscation of the equivalent of €mil. 7.5. In this regard, on 20 April 2021 the Court of Appeal of Brescia, following the requests by AgustaWestland SpA and AgustaWestland Ltd for the review of the abovementioned rulings, revoked the rulings challenged and acquitted the abovesaid companies. Since times for a possible appeal to the Supreme Court expired, the ruling became definitive. As regards the investigations started by the Indian Judicial Authority (CBI) in February 2013 for the same facts referred to above, on 2 February 2018 a notice was served on AgustaWestland International Ltd., whereby the latter was invited to appear at the hearing to be held on 30 May 2018 before the Patiala House Court in New Delhi within the criminal proceedings brought therein against the aforesaid company and other entities and persons, including Leonardo Spa. On 13 April 2018 the Milan Public Prosecutor’s Office served the abovementioned notice of invitation to appear at the hearing on 30 May 2018 on Leonardo S.p.a.. The Company submitted an application for enforcement review before the Judge for Preliminary Investigations (GIP) of the Court of Milan, which was rejected on 22 May 2018, as well as an appeal before the Lazio Regional Administrative Court. The Company also took the same legal actions with respect to the service of the notice of invitation to appear in court at the hearing on 10 September 2018. By a judgment dated 3 July 2019, the Lazio Regional Administrative Court rejected the appeals submitted by Leonardo S.p.a.; the Company then filed an appeal against the abovementioned measures. By a judgment dated 7 May 2020 the Council of State granted the appeals submitted by Leonardo. Leonardo S.p.a. has brought the same lawsuits before the administrative Court and before the Judge for Preliminary Investigations of the Court of Milan, including with reference to the services of notice of invitation to appear at the hearings set on 18 September 2019 and 18 December 2019. The Lazio Regional Administrative Court, by judgment dated 24 September 2021, rejected the appeals submitted by Leonardo. The Company filed an appeal with the Council of State. On the contrary AgustaWestland International Ltd appeared at the hearings set within the proceedings brought by the Central Bureau of Investigation; the proceedings are continuing before the Patiala House Court of New Delhi. On 28 August 2019 the Public Prosecutor’s Office of Milan served on Leonardo S.p.A. a notice of invitation to appear at the hearing of 18 September 2019 within further proceedings brought by the Indian Judicial Authority (Directorate of Enforcement) in relation to the supply of 12 AW 101 VIP/VVIP helicopters to the Indian Government. The Company submitted an application for enforcement review before the Judge for Preliminary Investigations of the Court of Milan, as well as an appeal with the Lazio Regional Administrative Court, even in relation to this notice. The Lazio Regional Administrative Court, by the same judgment of 24 September 2021, rejected the appeal submitted by Leonardo which filed an appeal with the Council of State.


 
270. 
Separate Financial Statements at 31 December 2021. 
Finally, it should be noted that on 11 February 2020 a notice was served on AgustaWestland International Ltd whereby it was invited to appear in court within the proceedings brought by the Indian Judicial Authority (Directorate of Enforcement). • By appeal to the Supreme Court served on 12 January 2022, the attorney general challenged the judgment whereby on 19 January 2021 the Court of Appeals of Milan rejected the appeals submitted against the judgment whereby on 15 June 2017 the Court of Milan acquitted certain directors of the then-Breda Termomeccanica S.p.A., subsequently Ansaldo S.p.A., who served during the period from 1973 to 1985, charged with having committed the crimes under Article 589, paragraphs 1, 2 and 3, Article 40, paragraph 2, Article 41, paragraph 1 of the Italian Criminal Code, Article 2087 of the Italian Civil Code and Article 590, paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, of the Italian Criminal Code, for violation of the rules governing the prevention of occupational diseases. It should be noted that Leonardo S.p.a. had entered appearance in the civil action within the abovementioned proceedings. • The phase of debate is still continuing within the criminal proceedings pending before the Court of Vercelli against three former employees of AgustaWestland S.p.A. (who are currently working for Leonardo – Helicopters Division) and an employee of AgustaWestland Philadelphia Corporation for the crime referred to in Article 449 of the Italian Criminal Code in relation to Articles 428 and 589 of the Italian Criminal Code, relating to the accident that occurred in Santhià on 30 October 2015. Based upon the information gathered and the results of the analysis carried out so far, the Directors of Leonardo did not allocate any specific provisions in relation to these cases. Any negative developments - which cannot be foreseen, nor determined to date - arising from any internal investigations or judicial investigations being conducted, will be subject to consistent assessment for the purposes of provisions (if any).
* * * * * * * * With regard to the provisions for civil, tax and administrative disputes, it is underlined that the Company’s operations regard industries and markets where many disputes, both as petitioner and plaintiff, are settled only after a considerable period of time, especially in cases where the customer is a government entity. Pursuant to the IFRSs, provisions have only been set aside for risks that are deemed probable and for which the amount can be determined. No specific provisions have been set aside for certain disputes in which the Company is defendant as these disputes are reasonably expected to be settled, based on current knowledge, satisfactorily and without significantly impacting the Company. Of particular note are the following disputes: • the proceedings brought by Firema under extraordinary management before the Court of Naples against the directors and statutory and independent auditors of Firema Trasporti (R.G. 32257/13) in order to have them declared responsible for the financial collapse caused to the company, within which Leonardo S.p.a. and AnsaldoBreda S.p.a. have been summoned as parties concerned, have been postponed to the hearing scheduled on 10 March 2022 for the joinder to proceedings R.G. no. 16312/15 described below. It should be noted that, within these proceedings, two of the defendants and specifically the former directors Giorgio and Gianfranco Fiore summoned Leonardo and AnsaldoBreda in court, on the grounds of an alleged abusive exercise of management and coordination activities that was perpetrated by the parties summoned to the detriment of Firema. On the basis of this assumption, Giorgio and Gianfranco Fiore therefore requested, primarily, that Leonardo and AnsaldoBreda be ordered to pay direct compensation to the plaintiff for any damages that should be ascertained, which they presumed to be €mil. 262 and which is equal to Firema's liabilities, and, alternatively, to be held harmless by the aforesaid companies. As to the action brought by GMR against Leonardo and AnsaldoBreda before the Court of Naples (R.G. 16312/15), the court referred the case to the President in order for the proceedings to be possibly joined to those described above at the hearing held on 1 October 2020. It should be noted that, within these proceedings, the plaintiff company states that Firema Trasporti was allegedly subject, during the period in which Leonardo S.p.a. held an investment in it (from 1993 to 2005),


 
271. 
Separate Financial Statements at 31 December 2021 to management and coordination activities that were carried out to its detriment and in the sole interest of the Leonardo Group and that, even after the sale of the aforesaid investment, Firema Trasporti was allegedly de facto subjected to an abuse of economic dependence from the abovementioned Leonardo Group in performing the various agreements existing with AnsaldoBreda. In both proceedings Leonardo S.p.a. and AnsaldoBreda S.p.a. appeared before the court requesting that, on the merits, the claims submitted against them be dismissed as clearly groundless as of fact and as of right. • The proceedings brought by Mr Pio Deiana before the Rome Court of Appeal – which were discontinued due to his subsequent death – have been resumed by one of the heirs within the prescribed time limits. Following the hearing held on 26 January 2022, the Court noting a lack of documentation attesting to the claimant’s capacity as heir of the deceased person, adjourned the case to the hearing of 4 May 2022 requesting that, in the meantime, such documentation be supplemented. It should be noted that in 2013 Pio Maria Deiana, on his own account and in his capacity as Director of Janua Dei S.r.l. and of Società Progetto Cina S.r.l., brought proceedings, before the Court of Rome, against Leonardo in order to ask the Court to rule the invalidity of the settlement agreement signed in 2000 by the aforesaid companies and the then-Ansaldo Industria, assuming that it was allegedly concluded based on unfair conditions. The claim was submitted against Leonardo, on the basis of the latter’s alleged general liability in the capacity as the parent company of Ansaldo Industria at the time of the events being disputed. The damages being sought, to be determined during the course of the proceedings, are estimated at €mil. 2,700. By a judgment dated 31 May 2018, the Court rejected the plaintiff’s claim.
* * * * * * * * Moreover, given their complexity, their cutting-edge technological content and the nature of the customers, the Company’s long-term contracts are sometimes affected by disputes with customers in relation to the compliance of works with customer specifications and product performances. The Group adjusts the estimated contract costs for foreseeable issues, also taking into account the possible developments in the relevant disputes. With regard to contracts in progress affected by uncertainties and issues under discussion with customers, there are: • by a request for arbitration filed on 25 October 2019, Leonardo S.p.a. and PSC S.p.A. (collectively referred to as “LP” unincorporated joint venture,) initiated arbitration proceedings against Galfar Misnad Engineering & Contracting W.L.L., Salini-Impregilo S.p.A. (now Webuild) and Cimolai S.p.A. (collectively referred to “GSIC” unincorporated joint venture) to seek an order imposing them to pay, among others, the fees that were still unpaid and any additional costs relating to the subcontract that had been entered into between the parties on 22 September 2016, whereby GSIC appointed LP to provide supplies and carry out certain manufacturing operations. These electrical, mechanical and plumbing plant engineering works are included in the general contract, awarded to GSIC, for the design and construction of the Al Bayt Stadium in Al Khor City (Qatar). The regular progress of the subcontracted works was strongly affected by a number of delays not attributable to LP, as well as by numerous additions and variations to the works that had been initially agreed and the shortcomings of the technical documentation prepared by GSIC. On the other hand, the latter submitted allegations to the contrary, while also charging LP with having caused damage to its organisation. In this context, on a preliminary basis LP asked the court to order GSIC to pay the remaining instalments of the fees initially envisaged in the subcontract, as well as any and all additional costs incurred for a total of QARmil. 1,432 (about €mil. 347 at 20 January 2022). On the other hand, GSIC contested any charges and asked the court, on a counterclaim basis, to order LP to compensate for any damage the latter had allegedly caused, for a total of QARmil. 755 (about €mil. 183 at 20 January 2022). From a procedural point of view, the phase for the exhibition of documents between the parties was completed in December 2021 following an initial exchange of briefs and statements (including the Memorial of claim submitted by LP in November 2020 and the subsequent Memorial of defence and

Separate Financial Statements at 31 December 2021 counterclaim submitted by GSIC in July 2021). Additional statements of defence are expected to be filed during the first half of 2022, while the hearing for arbitration proceedings is currently scheduled on the days from 4 to 15 July 2022. Finally, the award is expected to be issued in February 2023, after a final exchange of statements of claim and reply, according to the procedural schedule that is currently in force between the parties.

31 december 2020 31 december 2021. 
Severance pay provision 250 239. 
Defined contribution plans 26 31 276 270. 
The severance pay provision showed a reduction essentially due to early retirements under art. 4 of Law 92/2012 (Fornero Act). The amount of the costs related to employee benefit obligations, which was recognised during the year under financial expense, is equal to €mil. 1 (€mil. 2 at 31 December 2020). Below are the changes in the severance pay: 
31 december 2020 31 dicembre 2021. 
Opening balance 272 250. 
Net interest expense 2 1. 
Remeasurement 2 8. 
Actuarial losses (gains) through equity - financial assumptions 2 8. 
Benefits paid (25) (19)
Other changes (1) (1)
Closing balance 250 239. 
It should be noted that the portion of cost for the year relating to amounts transferred to pension funds or to a treasury fund managed by INPS is recognised according to the rules for defined-contribution plans, without any actuarial assessment. The main actuarial assumptions used in the valuation of defined-benefit plans and of the portion of the severance pay that has maintained the nature of defined-benefit plan are as follows: 
31 december 2020 31 december 2021. 
Discount rate (annual) 0.4% 0.7%
Inflation rate 0.4% 1.4% 
The sensitivity analysis for each significant actuarial assumption, which shows the effects on bonds in absolute value, is as follows: 
31 december 2020 31 december 2021 -0.25% +0.25% -0.25% +0.25%
Discount rate (annual) 4 (4) 3 (3)
Inflation rate (4) 4 (2) 2. 
The average duration of the severance pay is 5 years.

Payables to related parties increased overall by €mil. 128 compared to the previous year mainly due to the discounted recognition of non-current payable to Agustawestland Philadelphia Corporation related to the acquisition of the license (see Note 8). “Deferred income” specifically includes subsequent years rentals already collected in past years in relation to the agreements for the sale of “Ansaldo” trademark and royalties and grants collected. “Other payables” mainly related to down payments received from customers for €mil. 62 (€mil. 37 at 31 December 2020) and to penalties on programmes for €mil. 35 (€mil. 68 at 31 December 2020).

As regards the most important loans and receivables we note that: • Non-current receivables, equal to €mil. 443 (€mil. 243 at 31 December 2020), were up by €mil.200. They mainly relate to the “Revolving credit facility” granted in 2021 to Kopter Group AG to finance the development of the new AW09 single-engine helicopter. The originally granted loan allowed the subsidiary to discharge the current financial receivable that at 31 December 2020 amounted to €mil. 243 and Leonardo to use, for an amount of €mil. 155, a part of the loan for the company recapitalisation. At 31 December 2021, the loan amount was €mil. 190; • Current loans and receivables amounted to €mil. 63 (€mil. 463 at 31 December 2020). The €mil.400 decrease is chiefly due to the mentioned discharge made by Kopter Group AG. Loans and receivables arise from financing activities conducted by Leonardo in favour of the Group companies, as a result of the abovementioned centralisation of Treasury resources; • Other receivables equal to €mil. 26 (€mil. 101 at 31 December 2020) included amounts deriving from the Group tax consolidation mechanism, recognised by the Leonardo S.p.a., the party having a legal relationship with the Tax Authority;

“Financial income (expense)” relates to interest on financial receivables and payables and commissions which mainly arise from the centralisation of the management of Group treasury resources within Leonardo. In carrying out its treasury management functions, the Company acts as the main counterparty, always at arm’s length, for the financial assets and liabilities of the subsidiaries within the scope of such centralisation.

Separate Financial Statements at 31 December 2021 35. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT. 
Leonardo Spa is exposed to financial risks associated with its operations, specifically related to these types of risks: • interest-rate risks, related to exposure to financial instruments; • exchange-rate risks, related to operations in currencies other than the reporting currency; • liquidity risks, relating to the availability of financial resources and access to the credit market; • credit risks, resulting from normal commercial transactions or financing activities.
The Company carefully and specifically follows each of these financial risks, with the objective of promptly minimising them, even using hedging derivatives. The sections below provide an analysis, conducted through sensitivity analysis, of the potential impact on the final results deriving from assumed fluctuations in reference parameters. As required by IFRS 7, these analyses are based on simplified scenarios applied to the final results of the reference periods and, by their own nature, they cannot be considered as indicators of the actual effects of future changes in reference parameters with different financial statements and market conditions, and cannot reflect the inter-relations and the complexity of reference markets. Below is the main information related to the abovementioned risks. However, for further details reference is made to the section on “Financial risk management” of the consolidated financial statements.
Interest rate risk Leonardo is exposed to interest rate risk on borrowings. The management of interest rate risk is consistent with the long-standing practice of reducing the risk of fluctuations in interest rates while seeking to minimise related borrowing costs. In this regard, it should be noted that loans and borrowings at 31 December 2021, equal to €mil. 6,627, included lease liabilities of €mil. 537. The amount of fixed-rate loans and borrowings (including by using hedging instruments) was equal to about 45% and, consequently, the amount at variable rate was equal to about 55%. At 31 December 2021, the transactions were the following: • options for €mil. 200 (CAP at 4.20% and Knock out at 5.60% in relation to the 6-month Euribor interest rate), originally purchased in order to partially cover the bond issue due 2025. Moreover, given the low cost, it is currently deemed appropriate not to settle the transaction, in order to use it in the event of the Group’s strategy providing for a return to the floating rate and the levels of said rate should become unfavourable; • floating/fixed interest rate swap for €mil. 300 relating to the EIB loan in the same amount, which guarantees a fixed rate of 1.82% on the loan.
The detail of the main interest-rate swaps at 31 December 2021 is as follows:

Exchange rate risk Exchange-rate risk management for the Group is governed by the Directive issued by Leonardo S.p.a., the purpose of which is to standardise management criteria based on industrial-not-speculative strategies so as to contain risks within specific limits by carefully and constantly assessing all foreign currency transaction positions. The methodology adopted calls for the systematic hedging of commercial cash flows resulting from the assumption of contractual commitments that are certain or highly probable as either buyer or seller, thereby ensuring current exchange rates at the date of acquisition of multi-year contracts and neutralising the effects of exchange-rate fluctuations. As a result, contracts for purchases or sales denominated in a currency different from the functional currency are hedged using forward contracts of amounts, maturities, and key parameters that are similar to the underlying position. The Company defines the existence of an economic relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item on the basis of the currency, amounts and respective cash flows and assesses whether the derivative designated in each hedging relationship will be and has been effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged item. In the event that, due to their nature or following events that entail their ineffectiveness, derivative instruments held in the portfolio should be found to no longer be a hedge, the fair value of the instrument is recognised through profit and loss according to accounting principles. In the event the designation of the instrument as a hedge should continue to be supported, the cash-flow hedge accounting method of recognition is adopted (see Note 4.3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements). Leonardo carries out these transactions with banks in its own interest and of Group companies. The Company hedges the risks related to short-term financial payables and receivables denominated in currencies other than the euro and enters into foreign exchange transactions in the interest of other Group companies totalling €mil. 6,549 (notional amount), as detailed in the following table:

Swap and forward transactions 3,116 2,693 5,809 3,715 2,834 6,549.

Liquidity risk. 
Leonardo is exposed to liquidity risk, i.e. the risk of not being able to finance the prospective requirements arising from usual business and investment operations, as well as those connected with the volatility of the relevant markets in relation to commercial contracts at risk of renegotiation or cancellation. Therefore, there is the risk of not being able to repay or refinance debts at the expiry dates.
In order to face the series of above-mentioned risks, Leonardo has adopted a series of instruments aimed at optimizing the management of financial resources by resorting to bank and bond transactions. In order to mainly finance its operations, the Company has at its disposal: - the cash and cash equivalents of €mil. 1,875 generated at 31 December 2021; - an ESG-linked Revolving Credit Facility (RCF), available to Leonardo S.p.a., amounting to €bil. 2.4, comprising a 5-year tranche of €bil. 1.8 expiring in September 2026 and a 3-year tranche of €mil. 600 expiring in September 2024. Both the RCF tranches had been entirely unused at 31 December 2021; - uncommitted bank credit lines totalling €mil. 810 (entirely unused at 31 December 2021); - the Term Loan ESG-Linked credit line of di €mil. 600 subscribed and entirely used at December 2021 expiring in 2027. Such loan was aimed at repaying the bond expired in January 2022; - unconfirmed lines of credit for guarantees for a total amount of €mil. 10,324, of which an amount of €mil. 3,750, available at 31 December 2021;

Separate Financial Statements at 31 December 2021 - the EMTN (Euro Medium Term Note) Programme, out of which all the bonds of Leonardo S.p.a. were issued, which are currently in place on the Euromarket and which had been used for a total nominal amount of €mil. 2,156 at 31 December 2021, compared to a total amount of €mil. 4,000 under the programme.
Credit risk The Company is exposed to credit risk, which is defined as the probability of an insolvency with respect to a credit position with commercial and financial counterparties. Regarding commercial transactions, the most significant programmes are made with public sector contractors or contractors belonging to public institutions, mainly in the Euro area, in the UK, the US and the Middle East. The risks associated with the counterparty, for contracts with countries for which there are no usual commercial relations, are analysed and valued at the time of the offer in order to mitigate insolvency risks, if any. While solvency is guaranteed with public-entity customers, collection times are longer (in some countries they are significantly longer) than for other business sectors, creating significant outstanding credit positions and the subsequent need for transactions to convert the receivables into cash. When possible, the Company hedges against potential defaults of its customers by entering into insurance policies with leading Export Credit Agencies (ECAs) internationally and with major Italian agencies (eg. SACE). The types of contracts entered into by the Group provide for sizeable retention money withheld by customers, as well as back-to-back clauses in case of sub-supplies. These cases inherently extend the times for collection of outstanding receivables. Furthermore, the Company operates in markets which are or have been recently affected by geopolitical or financial tensions. In particular, with reference to the situation at 31 December 2021, we note the following relations with countries exposed to credit risk according to the international institutions (SACE): €mil.

Liabilities (12) (13) (125) (1) (87) (70) (308)
Net exposure (7) (9) (64) 26 5 1 (48)
As at 31 December 2021, the countries identified by SACE as countries at risk included Ukraine, to which - as indicated in Note 6 to which reference should be made - the Group has no balance sheet exposures Finally, the receivables related to these agreements, as illustrated in the section on “Leonardo and risk management” of the Report on Operations, might not be paid, renegotiated or written off. The table below summarises trade receivables at 31 December 2021 and 2020 (values in €bil.):

Portion due 1.6 0.7 - of which: for more than 12 months 0.9 0.2. 
Portion not yet due 1.4 2.3. 
Total trade receivables 3.0 3.0. 
A part of the portion due is offset by a liability, in relation to payable items or provisions for risks on any net excesses. Loans and receivables, equal to €mil. 916 (€mil. 320 at 31 December 2020) include €mil. 13 (€mil. 6 at 31 December 2020) classified as “non-current” and subsequently excluded from the net financial position. The table below shows the breakdown of loans and receivables:

Current financial receivables from relates parties 63 463. 
Other current financial receivables 14 10. 
Total current financial receivables 77 473. 
Total financial receivables 320 916. 
Both the main trade and financial receivables are impaired based on their probability of default or individually in case of particular situations. Vice versa, for receivables that are not impaired individually, impairment provisions are accrued, using historical series, statistical data and probability of default on an aggregate basis also supported by qualitative analyses. During the year, receivables were assigned without recourse for a total volume of €mil. 169 (€mil. 1,790 in 2020). The amount of the assignments is significantly lower than the previous year's figure, also thanks to an objective progressive improvement in the emergency situation during 2021, which has allowed the dynamics underlying the realisation of collection flows to be restored, linearising the flow trend.
Classification of financial assets and liabilities The table below shows the fair value hierarchy for the financial assets and liabilities of Leonardo Spa measured at fair value. The fair value of derivatives (classified under other current assets and liabilities) and of current securities is determined on the basis of measurement techniques which consider directly observable market inputs (the so-called “Level 2”). The fair value of the earn-out linked to the acquisition of Kopter was determined on the basis of measurement techniques which do not consider directly observable market inputs (the so-called “Level 3”), by discounting back the estimate of the variable amounts payable on the basis of the commercial performance of the programme.

36. REMUNERATION TO KEY MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL. 
Remuneration paid to persons who have strategic power and responsibility of Leonardo S.p.a. amounted to €mil. 10 (€mil. 9 at 31 December 2020). Remuneration paid to Directors, excluding managers with strategic responsibility, amounted to about €mil. 2 (€mil. 2 in 2020). This figure includes fees and other compensation, pensions and other benefits, including the portion borne by the Company.
37. SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS. 
In order to implement an incentive and retention system for the Group’s employees and associates, starting from 2015 Leonardo adopted incentive plans which provide for the assignment of Leonardo shares, subject to assessing the attainment of pre-set business targets. These shares will be awarded to the beneficiaries at the end of the vesting period, provided that they have met the condition of being still employed with the company. The cost recognised in the income statement for the share incentive plans amounted in 2021 to €mil. 9 (€mil. 10 in 2020). With specific regard to the Long-Term Incentive Plan, the fair value used to measure the portion linked to the performance indicators (Group Net Debt, ROS and starting from the three-year cycle 2021-2023

Sustainability Indicators) was equal to € 10.25 (the value of Leonardo shares at the grant date of 31 July 2018) with reference to the three-year cycle 2018-2020, it was equal to € 11.04 (the value of Leonardo shares at the grant date of 31 July 2019) with reference to the three-year cycle 2019-2021, to € 5.41 (the value of Leonardo shares at the grant date of 31 July 2020) with reference to the three-year cycle 2020-2022 and to € 6.788 (the value of Leonardo shares at the grant date of 31 July 2021) with reference to the three-year cycle 2021-2023. Vice versa, the award of the remaining amount of the shares depends upon market conditions which affect the determination of the fair value (“adjusted fair value”). The adjusted fair value, calculated using the “Monte Carlo” method in order to simulate the possible performance of the stock and of the other companies within the basket, was equal to € 3.51 with reference to the three-year cycle 2018-2020, it was equal to € 6.72 with reference to the three-year cycle 2019-2021, to € 1.73 with reference to the three-year cycle 20202022 and to € 3.7 with reference to the three-year cycle 2021-2023. The input data used to calculate the adjusted fair value were: • the stock price at the grant date; • the average share price in the three months preceding the performance period; • the risk-free interest rate based on the zero-coupon yield curve in 36 months; • the expected volatility of the price of Leonardo shares and of the shares of the other companies within the basket based on time series in the 36 months prior to the grant date; • correlation coefficients between Leonardo and the other companies within the basket on the basis of logarithms of the daily performance of the stocks in the 36 months prior to the grant date; • dividend distribution forecasts on a historical basis.
In 2021, the conditions for the granting of 133,560 shares under the co-investment plan and the long-term incentive plan have been met.

Independent auditor’s report pursuant to article 14 of Legislative Decree n. 39, dated January 27, 2010 and article 10 of EU Regulation n. 537/2014 (Translation from the original Italian text) To the Shareholders of Leonardo S.p.A. Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements Opinion. 
We have audited the financial statements of Leonardo S.p.A. (the Company), which comprise the statement of financial position as at December 31, 2021, the separate income statement, the statement of comprehensive income, the statement of cash flows and the statement of changes in equity for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. In our opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Company as at December 31, 2021, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union and with the regulations issued for implementing art. 9 of Legislative Decree n. 38/2005. Basis for Opinion. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the regulations and standards on ethics and independence applicable to audits of financial statements under Italian Laws. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Other matters The financial statements of Leonardo S.p.A. for the year ended December 31, 2020, were audited by another auditor who expressed an unmodified opinion on those statements on March 11, 2021. Key Audit Matters. 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We identified the following key audit matters:


2. 
Key Audit Matter Audit response. 
Recognition of revenues and losses from longterm contracts with customers. 

Revenues from long-term contracts with customers are recognized “over-time” using an input method for measuring progress towards complete satisfaction of performance obligations based on the percentage of completion obtained from the ratio of incurred costs on the total expected costs for the contract over the life of the project (cost to cost method). The estimation of the total expected project costs is, by its nature, complex and characterized by significant uncertainties as it may be impacted by many factors, including the ability to fulfill the obligations assumed towards customers, which may also result in penalties and additional expenses for significant amounts. Therefore, the estimate involves a high degree of judgment by Directors that may significantly affect the contract revenues recognition and any loss at completion in cases of negative margin expectation. Accordingly, we identified this area as a key audit matter. The disclosures related to the criteria applied for the recognition and measurement of revenues and margins on long-term contracts with customers are included in notes “3 Accounting principles” , “14 Contract assets and liabilities”, “22 Provisions for risk and charges and contingent liabilities” and “27 Revenues”.
Our audit procedures in response to the key audit matter included, among others: • the understanding of the criteria applied for the recognition of revenues from long-term contracts with customers; • the assessment of the process and key controls over the recognition of revenues from long-term contracts with customers; • for a sample of contracts we performed: (i) testing of relevant contractual terms and conditions in order to verify whether those were adequately considered in management estimates; (ii) testing of the reasonableness of key assumptions underlying the estimation of the life-of-project costs based on inquiries, analysis of any communications with customers and comparative analysis; (iii) comparative analysis between actual figures and estimates made in previous periods in order to assess the accuracy of management’s forecasting; (iv) testing of incurred costs and their allocation to proper on-going contracts.
Lastly, we have reviewed the disclosures provided in the notes to the financial statements regarding this key audit matter.

Test of the recoverability of goodwill and equity investments. 
Goodwill and equity investments as at December 31, 2021 amount to Euro 3.707 million and 7.684 million, respectively. Directors tested for impairment the Cash Generating Units (CGUs) to which goodwill and equity investments have been allocated in order to identify any impairment loss in respect of their recoverable amount.
Our audit procedures in response to the key audit matter included, among others: • the assessment of the procedure applied in the performance of the impairment test as approved by Directors; • testing of the criteria applied for identifying the CGUs and allocating relevant assets and liabilities to them;


3. 
The recoverable amount of each CGU is determined using the value in use method and it is based on complex assumptions that inherently involve a degree of judgment by Directors, with reference to the expected cash flows over the period considered in the Business Plan 20222026, to the estimate of the terminal value and the determination of the long-term growth and discount rates. Because of the judgement involved and the complexity of the assumptions underlying the estimation of the recoverable amount of goodwill and equity investments, we identified this area as a key audit matter. Disclosures on the assumptions and the estimations adopted when performing the impairment test are included in the notes “3 Accounting Principles“, “8 Intangible Assets” and “11 Equity investments”.
• the assessment of the presence of any impairment indicator on the recoverability of equity investments; • the analysis of the expected cash flows of each CGU and testing of their consistency with the expected cash flows resulting from the Business Plan 2022-2026; • the assessment of the reasonableness of the estimates made by Directors, also by comparing actual figures and estimates made in previous periods; • the assessment of the long-term growth and discount rates; • the assessment of the sensitivity analysis performed by Directors on key assumptions underlying the impairment test.

In performing our procedures we involved our experts in valuation techniques. Lastly, we have reviewed the disclosures provided in the notes to the financial statements regarding this key audit matter.
Recognition and subsequent measurement of non-recurring costs and development costs. 
Non-recurring costs and developments costs capitalized as intangible assets as at December 31, 2021 amount to an aggregate of Euro 2.057 million. The initial recognition of these assets and the subsequent assessment of their recoverability are based on complex assumptions that inherently involve a degree of judgment by Directors as influenced by many factors including the time horizon of the product business plans and management’s ability to forecast the commercial success of the underlying technologies. Because of the judgement involved and the complexity of the underlying assumptions, we identified this area as a key audit matter. Disclosures on the assumptions and the estimations adopted in the recognition and subsequent measurement of non-recurring costs. 
Our audit procedures in response to the key audit matter included, among others: • understanding of the processes applied in recognizing for non-recurring costs and development costs and the process related to the assessment of their recoverability, including the estimation of units of production to be sold and related expected cash flows; • for a sample of development programs we performed: (i) substantive procedures aimed at verifying internal and external costs recognized during the period; (ii) assessment of the reasonableness of key assumptions underlying the product business plans; (iii) testing of the discount rates; (iv) assessment of the sensitivity analysis performed by Directors on the key assumptions underlying the impairment test.


4 and development costs are included in the notes “3 Accounting principles“ and “8 Intangible Assets”.
In performing our procedures we involved our experts in valuation techniques. Lastly, we have reviewed the disclosures provided in the notes to the financial statements regarding this key audit matter.
Responsibilities of Directors and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial Statements. 
The Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union and with the regulations issued for implementing art. 9 of Legislative Decree n. 38/2005 and, within the terms provided by the law, for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. The Directors are responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern and, when preparing the financial statements, for the appropriateness of the going concern assumption, and for appropriate disclosure thereof. The Directors prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis unless they either intend to liquidate the Company or to cease operations or have no realistic alternative but to do so. The statutory audit committee (Collegio Sindacale) is responsible, within the terms provided by the law, for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process. Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements. 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia), we have exercised professional judgment and maintained professional skepticism throughout the audit. In addition: • we have identified and assessed the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designed and performed audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtained audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control; • we have obtained an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control;


5 • we have evaluated the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Directors; • we have concluded on the appropriateness of Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to consider this matter in forming our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company [the Group] to cease to continue as a going concern; • we have evaluated the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
We have communicated with those charged with governance, identified at an appropriate level as required by ISA Italia, regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. We have provided those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with the ethical and independence requirements applicable in Italy, and we have communicated with them all matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we have determined those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We have described these matters in our auditor’s report. Additional information pursuant to article 10 of EU Regulation n. 537/14. 
The Shareholders of Leonardo S.p.A., in the general meeting held on May 20, 2020, engaged us to perform the audits of the financial statements and consolidated financial statements for each of the years ending December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2029. We declare that we have not provided prohibited non-audit services, referred to article 5, par. 1, of EU Regulation n. 537/2014, and that we have remained independent of the Company in conducting the audit. We confirm that the opinion on the financial statements included in this report is consistent with the content of the additional report to the audit committee (Collegio Sindacale) in their capacity as audit committee, prepared pursuant to article 11 of the EU Regulation n. 537/2014. Report on compliance with other legal and regulatory requirements Opinion on the compliance with Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815.

SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE. 
Leonardo has drawn up the company rules on Sustainability, the Group Policy that sets out the sustainability model adopted by the Group, including in terms of responsibilities and the Procedure that outlines the underlying processes. The Board of Directors, supported by the Sustainability and Innovation Committee and the Control and Risks Committee, is responsible for setting out the key guidelines on sustainability and establishing whether sustainability objectives have been pursued in line with the Business Plan. Furthermore, all the Board Committees provide their support to the Board - each one within the sphere of its respective competence - in considering the topics that are material for Leonardo for the purposes of generating long-term value. The Sustainability and Innovation Committee is composed of four non-executive and independent Directors and, in agreement - for the areas of competence - with the Control and Risks Committee, it also monitors Leonardo's positioning in the main Sustainability/ESG indices, promotes the methods of interaction with stakeholders (stakeholder engagement), examines the general approach of the NFS, supports the Company in setting out and assessing technological capabilities and in establishing academic and research networks. The Sustainability Organisational Unit (OU), under the responsibility of the Chief Technology and Innovation Officer (CTIO), is responsible for guidance, management, monitoring and strategic dialogue on Group sustainability issues. Reporting and relations with financial stakeholders on ESG issues are instead managed, under the responsibility of the Chief Financial Officer (CFO), by the ESG & Integrated Reporting OU, within Administration and Budget, and by the Investor Relations & Credit Rating Agencies OU, respectively, with the aim of providing a full and integrated view of the Company. The Sustainability Coordinators – within the various divisions, Corporate functions and Group companies -are the internal connection point and are involved in the process of setting out, implementing and monitoring the Sustainability Plan, ensuring consistency between objectives, sustainability programmes and non-financial indicators. In order to strengthen the governance system, the remuneration policy also includes the achievement of objectives linked to specific ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) indicators78.

MATERIALITY ANALYSIS. 
The materiality analysis (or priority analysis) allows the identification and evaluation of the themes that are priorities for the stakeholders, as weighed on the basis of their relevance and comparing them with the Group’s priorities and industrial strategy, taking the impacts they generate and any misalignments into account. The result of this analysis, reported in the priority matrix, supports and steers the preparation of the Financial Statements and the identification of key targets, the achievement of which is contributed to by the various Group’s Functions and Divisions.
Leonardo updates the materiality analysis on a periodical basis for an appropriate description of the expectations of its stakeholders and the Group’s key priorities. The last update of the priority matrix is the outcome of an analysis, which was started in 2021 and completed in 2022 with its presentation to the Sustainability and Innovation Committee, concerning the regulations, best practices and priorities in the sector and public opinion on economic and financial, environmental, social and corporate governance issues.
The method used is that required by the GRI Standards, while also taking account of the guidelines of the SASB. In order to identify and prioritise material and/or emerging issues, the Company used both intelligence and big data analytics (Datamaran cloud software), in support of a data-driven approach, and stakeholder engagement tools (an online survey aimed at a sample of stakeholders and top management). In particular, 1,877 national and international regulations, 21 companies in the sector and 10,829 press articles were analysed. The online survey involved 33 company functions and departments, 41 managers of Leonardo and a significant number of external stakeholders from 13 countries. The materiality analysis will support the definition of priorities on sustainability issues within the strategy and the Sustainability Plan. The Sustainability Plan is accompanied by a periodic updating process that envisages specific phases for the review and monitoring of the programmes, carried out in collaboration with the Sustainability Coordinators, who are specific officers appointed at Division, Company and corporate function level. This is a structured process that is part of the sustainability operating model adopted by the Group, which is governed under the Group Policy. Strategic actions will be further implemented and strengthened towards those topics and trends that have emerged as particularly material for stakeholders.

Description of material topics. 
R&D, innovation and advanced technologies. 
Sustainable supply chain Cyber security and data protection. 
Working conditions and health and safety at work. 
Innovation management, intellectual property enhancement and technological development foster innovativeness and new business models. The development of emerging and advanced technologies - with critical impacts on business activities and the community - enables solutions that meet and anticipate market demand.
Developing the competitiveness of the supply chain (including SMEs and regional clusters) through policies, procedures and targets to improve supplier performance and efficiency and alignment with basic values, with a commitment to complying with the highest ethical, social and environmental standards.
Ensuring business resilience and privacy by protecting sensitive data and information. Vulnerabilities in critical IT systems and networks, through security breaches, can discontinue business-critical activities and allow accidental or illegal access, destruction, alteration or disclosure of confidential data.
High and fair labour standards to guarantee fundamental rights at work, while promoting social dialogue and trade union relations. Among the issues to be considered are health and safety management (in particular risk prevention), establishing optimal conditions for employees’ productivity and managing organisational change.
Digital transformation Customer intimacy Sound corporate governance Well-being, inclusion and equal opportunities. 
Integration, development and deployment of digital technologies and connectivity are driving a cultural shift towards digitisation. This entails a profound impact on business models, the entire product life cycle and customer experience.
Managing the relationship between the Company and the Customer in a partnership perspective, while developing strategies and processes to meet or exceed expectations, create a positive experience and retain customer loyalty. Corporate reputation and the stakeholders’ perception depend on performance, including in the area of sustainability, key decisions and the ability to create value.
Board of Directors’ proceedings effectiveness, remuneration policy, ESG governance structure, management of relations with shareholders and all stakeholders, on the basis of reliable financial and nonfinancial information. These practices and processes foster sustainable results and the creation of economic, social and environmental value in the long term.
Promoting an inclusive, meritocratic and fair corporate environment and culture, where diversity, including gender diversity, is recognised as an enabling factor for value creation. Factors such as welfare and work-life balance, adequate and fair remuneration, equal opportunities, improve performance, satisfaction and sense of belonging.

Citizens’ security Development of territories and communities. 
Business continuity Climate change, adaptation and mitigation. 
National and international threats - violations of law and order, terrorism, organised crime, physical/cyber attacks, natural disasters - are risks to the country and for the security of citizens, businesses, critical infrastructures and territories, with strong impacts on the continuity of economic activities.
Integrated solutions, both military and civil, contribute to countering these risks.
Strengthening relations and dialogue with the communities with which the Company interacts in order to ensure well-being and support social and economic progress, through industrial footprint, support to suppliers operating at local level, cooperation with local projects and support to projects.
Preparing plans, actions, protocols and training to deal with disastrous, critical or unexpected events, ensuring the operation of businesscritical operations and activities. Among the risk factors that may affect business continuity are also those related to public health, including the spread of infectious diseases and pandemics.
Impacts, risks and opportunities linked to climate change.
Development of solutions that reduce emissions from products, services and activities (e.g., low carbon technology, digitisation, energy efficiency, renewable sources, sustainable mobility). Measures to combat climate change and mitigate its effects.

Management of natural resources. 
Management of processes and projects to ensure the quality, reliability and safety of products and services, while guaranteeing efficient and distinctive performance and safety of end users.
Ensuring compliance with rules, policies and regulations, in areas such as anti-corruption, export control, human rights, fair competition, responsible tax practices, prevention of illegal conduct and proactive risk management.
Investments in control and reporting systems and the dissemination of corporate values promote ethical business conduct.
Selection, recruitment, management and retention of people and talents to establish and maintain a skilled workforce and stimulate company growth, in a context of increasing competition linked to the evolution of work and the difficulty in finding skills. This includes continuous learning, re-skilling, talent enhancement and development of resources at all levels.
Efficiency and minimisation of social/environmental damage in the management of water, hazardous/non- hazardous waste, harmful substances, while limiting contamination and pollution and protecting biodiversity. Waste recycling, reduction and recovery, proper management of materials and circular economy practices contribute to the responsible management of natural resources.
REPORTING SCOPE. 
The 2021 environmental reporting scope79 covered 106 sites around the world (equal to about 98% of total employees in the 2021 Consolidated Financial Statements). The scope has been based on the materiality of the environmental impact from operating sites, the number of employees of Leonardo SpA’s and its subsidiaries consolidated on a line-by-line basis. In order to ensure consistency with the consolidation criteria of the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Group’s environmental data do not include those of the joint ventures. The personnel reporting scope corresponds to 100% of companies consolidated on a line-by-line basis in the 2021 Consolidated Financial Statements. Any possible limitations are set out from time to time in this document.

United States 27 31 32. 
Poland 1 1 1. 
Rest of the World 8 12 12. 
Total sites 95 103 106 

79 Environmental data, as reported through the Group's web-based system (and in particular those relating to energy consumption), were obtained through: direct measurements (e.g., meters and consumption measurement systems); calculations (e.g., bills; purchase orders/invoices); estimates based on the number of employees and/or activities carried out. In particular, with regard to emissions into the atmosphere, where sites have monitoring systems (e.g. industrial sites), these are calculated from laboratory analyses carried out during the year. If these analyses are not carried out (e.g. at office sites and/or in cases where the production processes conducted are not characterised by emissions into the atmosphere), the Group's reporting system automatically calculates the NOX and SO2 emissions produced, based on the annual consumption of methane and diesel fuel for the production of energy/heat and emission coefficients available in literature.

GRI 207-1 Approach to tax GRI 207-2 Tax governance, control and risk management GRI 207-3 Stakeholder engagement and management of concerns related to tax Leonardo is committed to complying with tax regulations in force in the Countries where it is active. Correct fulfilment of tax obligations is ensured by the Company’s internal procedures that identify roles and responsibilities, operational and control activities and the necessary information flows. Leonardo has adopted a tax strategy in Italy approved by the Board of Directors since 2017 and in Great Britain, approved on an annual basis. Leonardo has also joined the Cooperative Compliance Scheme and, to monitor actions, has established a Tax Control Framework, i.e. a system for detecting, measuring, managing and controlling tax risk, included in the context of the company and internal control system. The approach to tax is inspired by the following values: > properly managing the "tax burden" related to its business while protecting the interests of all stakeholders, including the government and local communities in which Leonardo operates; > managing all results in compliance with national tax laws as regards both form and substance, in conformity with tax principles, while conducting, on an ongoing basis, an analysis of updates on national and international laws consistently with the activities carried out;

Tax returns and payments are subject to audits on the part of independent auditors. The Chief Executive Officer and the Officer in charge of Financial Reporting participate in tax-related decisions, in terms of both strategy and operations. They are responsible for monitoring tax risk management, the performance of the tax department, and the resources allocated in order to reduce tax risk while the BoD designs the related strategy. With a view to enhancing transparency towards the tax authorities, Leonardo complies with the provisions governing transfer pricing documentation, in accordance with the instructions of the Chapter V of OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for companies that meet the requirements prescribed by the relevant domestic regulations. Finally, Leonardo always acts by adopting a transparent and collaborative approach with all institutions and trade associations in order to support the development of effective tax systems in the various countries in which it operates.
GRI 207-4 Country-by-country reporting The table below is consistent with the information provided to the Revenue Agency (Revenue Agency Director’s Order file no. 275956 of 28 November 2017) within the framework of the "Country-by-Country Reporting” (CBCR). This information has been prepared by taking account of the OECD guidelines relating to this requirement. Therefore, although the figures shown are derived from the same database, they do not follow the rules of representation and preparation of the data included in the Group's consolidated financial statements. In particular, the main changes refer to the following requirements of the OECD guidelines, as reported in the abovementioned Order: • perimeter of companies: inclusion of all companies; • allocation by country: allocation of items relating to permanent establishments in the countries in which they operate, instead of the registered offices of the companies to which they belong, used to prepare consolidated financial statements; • definitions: levels of aggregation of specific data that are not immediately comparable with the values reported in the consolidated financial statements.

Data privacy In terms of personal data protection, Leonardo adopts technical and organisational measures to respect fundamental rights and freedoms and mitigate the risks associated with any possible violation. For this purpose, it has implemented processes, procedures and technologies to ensure the broadest protection of the data of employees, collaborators, guests, customers, suppliers and any natural person whose personal data are processed by Leonardo. The organisational structures and technologies used allow for the accurate and prompt detection of security threats and breaches. Processes, procedures and technologies are subject to audits at least on an annual basis to ensure full compliance with the highest standards of protection. Since 2017, Leonardo has designated a Group Data Protection Officer who oversees, monitors, and provides specialist advice to Leonardo when acting as both a data controller and a data processor, acts as a contact person for the supervisory authority and for data subjects in relation to any and all matters concerning the processing of their personal data and the exercise of their rights, with regard to the protection of personal data. By means of training, numerous reporting channels and support tools, in the event of situations or episodes that put people's data at risk, all employees and collaborators are trained and enabled to immediately give notices to the competent departments in order to adopt remedial and risk mitigation measures in accordance with law, according to the methods and schedules set out in the procedures for handling data breaches and managing incidents in general. If requests are submitted to exercise rights regarding the protection of personal data, Leonardo has set up specific organisational processes and information flows that make it possible to provide information regarding data processing in a transparent and easily accessible form and to follow up such requests promptly and effectively. Furthermore, Leonardo only uses suppliers that present sufficient guarantees to meet the requirements of the applicable privacy legislation and implements risk assessment and mitigation processes in any case of transfer of personal data outside the European Economic Area, in full compliance with current legislation. 11. Supply chain management


 
324. 
Methodology note of the Non-Financial Statement. 
Leonardo manages the sustainability of its supply chain by integrating environmental, social and governance parameters in any and all phases of collaboration with suppliers: from the application to become a supplier, to the pre-qualification and qualification phases to enter the register, from the selection criteria to the contract Terms and Conditions, up to the verification audits and development plans of suppliers. Potential suppliers of Leonardo must first pass a pre-qualification phase to establish whether they meet economic-financial, ethical-legal, social and environmental requirements. This is the preliminary assessment of the risk associated with establishing an industrial relationship with a potential supplier and consists of audits carried out both through an exchange of documents and through infoproviders. If there are risk factors, relating for example to ownership structures and final beneficiaries, an additional reputational analysis is carried out, with the support of specialist databases. The rate of dependence of turnover on the Leonardo Group is also measured during pre-qualification. Failure to meet even one of these requirements prevents the company from accessing Leonardo's Register of Suppliers. This is followed by the qualification phase, during which the technical and operational capabilities linked to specific supplies are assessed, as are the minimum requirements demanded by Leonardo regarding environmental management, health and safety protection, cyber security and intellectual property protection, which are also regulated by specific contractual clauses at any time contrattuali81. In 2021 in particular, the requirements relating to cyber security and intellectual property have been made more homogeneous and stringent, with lower tolerance thresholds compared to the possible risks and minimum requirements. In this phase, for example, Leonardo examines any possible certification uploaded to the Purchasing Portal by potential suppliers. According to the product sector, an additional audit, Product Qualification, may be necessary to establish whether the technical requirements of the component or part to be purchased are met. Successful completion of the qualification phase is necessary for the award of a tender and the assignment of a purchase order, and therefore to become effective suppliers of Leonardo. Furthermore, supplier selection takes account of the availability of specific additional ESG requirements, for example ISO 14001, ISO 45001, quality and cyber security certification for some product areas. The ongoing satisfaction of the requirements is monitored through periodic control activities throughout the term of the contractual relationship, both through recurring audits (every two years for pre-qualification requirements and every three years for qualification requirements) and through audit plans, going as far as temporary or definitive exclusion from the Register in cases of serious or repeated failures. As far as supplier audits on HSE issues are concerned, every year Leonardo sets out an audit plan and selects the suppliers that will have to be audited in the subsequent year, giving priority to those operating within Leonardo sites whose activities carried out and/or products supplied may have an impact on compliance with environmental or occupational health and safety regulations. Suppliers may also be selected for whom risk factors have emerged in relation to environmental, and occupational health and safety issues, either through reports or during the requalification phase, or even suppliers selected on a random basis. The audit consists of checks carried out by Leonardo personnel or by a third-party entity and is also an opportunity to inform the supplier of any possible opportunity for improvement. In any case of non-conformity, Leonardo always asks the supplier to take a corrective action, reported by the supplier in an Action Plan, complete with the related date of implementation, which is verified by Leonardo in the subsequent audit. Supplier relations are managed through the dedicated Portal to ensure transparency and traceability of information, and offer technical assistance and information materials.

During 2021, 6 violations of environmental laws were reported by the control bodies (11 in 2020, 6 in 2019 and 9 in 2018), 2 of which gave rise to fines imposed during the year. To these must be added 2 fines due for violations reported in 2016 and 2020. Total fines amounted to € 21,020. During 2021, 7 environmental incidents occurred, of which: 2 due to external causes (a fire of external origin to the site, extinguished by the company emergency team and subsequently checked by the Fire Brigades; a flood due to torrential rain, managed through recovery actions such as cleaning of infiltrations and pumping), 2 due to spills, 2 due to emissions into the atmosphere, promptly contained and managed and/or eliminated, and 1 due to exceeding the legal limit authorised for a parameter discharge. As part of the remediation process, no damage caused to the environment has been reported, for which Leonardo has been definitively found to be liable, and no final penalties are reported which have been imposed on Leonardo for environmental offences.

INFORMATION ON EU TAXONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE ACTIVITIES. 
REGULATORY FRAMEWORK. 
In 2019, the European Union unveiled the European Green Deal plan with the goal of achieving climate neutrality by 2050. In order to attain this goal, the European Union promotes investments in sustainable assets and activities. In this perspective, EU Regulation 2020/852 brought in a classification system or "taxonomy" of sustainable activities (Taxonomy Regulation), based on the use of the statistical classification codes of economic activities in the European Community (NACE codes - Nomenclature statistique des Activités économiques dans la Communauté Européenne). The Taxonomy Regulation sets out the criteria for establishing whether an economic activity can be considered environmentally sustainable based on its substantial contribution to six objectives: a) climate change mitigation; b) climate change adaptation; c) the sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources; d) the transition to a circular economy; e) pollution prevention and control; f) the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems. In 2021, the taxonomy regulatory framework was supplemented by a series of Delegated Acts: the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139 of 4 June 2021 (Climate Delegated Act) and the Commission's EU Delegated Regulation 2021/2178 of 6 July 2021, which regulates a mandatory disclosure regime for companies (Disclosures Regulation). The first Delegated Act to be published, the Climate Delegated Act, focused on activities that have a greater capacity to contribute to the first two objectives set out in the Taxonomy Regulation, climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation. With a view to the gradual application of the regulations, companies must publish, in the 2021 NFS, the level of "eligibility" of their economic activities, while from the 2022 edition a disclosure must be provided on activities "aligned" with the taxonomy, i.e. those "eligible" activities that simultaneously: contribute substantially to at least one of the environmental objectives, do not cause significant harm any of the other objectives, comply with both minimum social and governance safeguard clauses and technical screening criteria. Finally, it should be emphasised that the scope of the Taxonomy is expected to expand over time in terms of both the economic activities that are considered and the sustainability objectives that are analysed. In this regard, two documents recently published by the Platform on Sustainable Finance should be highlighted 84: 1. the document "Taxonomy pack for feedback "of 3 August 2021, which, on the one hand, lists environmentally sustainable activities on the four remaining environmental objectives and, on the other, analyses the possible contribution given by additional economic activities to the achievement of climate objectives; 2. the final "social taxonomy" report of 28 February 2022. Thus, not all sustainability goals and not all economic activities are regulated by the legislation that is currently in force.
 84 This is a platform established by the European Commission for the purposes of providing advice on taxonomy.

TAXONOMY AND THE AEROSPACE, DEFENSE & SECURITY SECTOR. 
The Climate Delegated Act does not include among sustainable activities the primary reference NACE code for the Aerospace, Defense & Security sector, NACE code C30.3 "Manufacture of air and spacecraft and related machinery." NACE code C30.3 is instead included within the aforementioned Platform on Sustainable Finance document of 3 August 2021 "Taxonomy pack for feedback", which is available for public consultation until 24 September 2021 to gather stakeholder feedback. Leonardo took part in the consultation by providing the Group's point of view on the basis of the considerations made by the internal working group, consisting of representatives of the various organisational units and Divisions. The outcomes of the consultation, which were originally planned for the end of 2021, will be disclosed in the first half of 2022. Leonardo will follow regulatory developments and will adjust its reporting and related disclosure requirements accordingly.621. 
LEONARDO REPORTING. 
Within the 2021 Report on Operations, Leonardo describes environmental and energy sustainability performance, as well as its commitments to reducing impacts and promoting responsible management of natural resources in industrial processes. The commitments are further strengthened by the application of metrics linked to greenhouse gas reduction both in the long-term variable remuneration policy of management and in the latest ESG-linked financing transactions that were entered into in the last quarter of 2021, which account for 50% of total sources of financing available to the Group. The efforts put in place were also recognized by CDP, which included Leonardo in the "Climate A List 2021", the list that includes the world's leading companies out of more than 13,000 analysed in the fight against climate change; the list is compiled on the basis of information on environment-related impacts, risks and opportunities, requested by more than 590 investors, which account for 110 trillion dollars of assets under management. In compliance with the Disclosures Regulation that supplements the Taxonomy Regulation, Leonardo publishes the required information for the year 2021 regarding the percentages of sales (Revenues), capital expenditures (Capex) and operating expenses (Opex) relating to sustainable taxonomy eligible and ineligible economic activities among those set out in the Delegated Acts (taxonomy-eligible).
2021 EU Taxonomy Report €mil. Eligible (%)
Non-eligible (%)
Revenues 14,135 0% 100%
Capex 676 1% 99%
Opex 503 17% 83%
The guidelines provided in Annex I attached to the Disclosures Regulation have been considered for the definition of the denominators of turnover (Revenues), Capex and Opex. For the numerators, the assessments of eligibility have been carried out by taking account of the descriptions of the economic activities included in Annex I (climate change mitigation) and Annex II (climate change adaptation) of the Climate Delegated Act. It should be noted that the numerators are affected by the lack of coverage of the primary business of Leonardo within the Climate Delegated Act. It should be noted that, considering the foreseeable regulatory developments and the above-mentioned consultation carried out by the Platform on Sustainable Finance, which included the NACE code C30.3 attributable to the operations in the AD&S sector, the percentages of taxonomy-eligible activities could undergo significant changes in 2022.
