The Sustainability Accounting and Standards Board (“SASB”) voluntary reporting standards are designed to enable the disclosure of company sustainability information in a clear and consistent manner so that it can be used by investors and other stakeholders. 2020/21 is the first year National Grid have published a SASB map to demonstrate alignment to the SASB Standards.
There are currently 77 SASB industry standards, of which 2 are considered relevant for National Grid. This SASB Index sets out our alignment with both: • Electric Utilities & Power Generators Standard • Gas Utilities and Distributors Standard. 
SASB Standards can be downloaded from the SASB website1.
This year we have achieved partial alignment to SASB, providing disclosures for 35/36 SASB metrics that are relevant to our business. We aim for full alignment next year (2021/22). Please view the ‘National Grid Disclosure’ column in the tables below which sets out where the relevant disclosures have been made, the majority referenced to our Responsible Business Report 2020/21 (“RBR”) and Annual Report and Accounts 2020/21 (“ARA”).
Please note when reading our SASB disclosures we have used some acronyms which have been defined in a glossary on page 7 of this document. Also note, many of the customer and billing focused SASB metrics are not applicable to our UK business as we do not sell gas or electricity direct to consumers. These metrics are only relevant to our US business for which the necessary information and data has been provided.

Electric Utilities & Power Generators Standard 2. Disclosure is representative of our US business only where we sell energy direct to consumers. Disclosure is not applicable to our UK business as transmission only (not customer facing). 3. US air emissions are associated with our energy generation plants, all of which are located on Long Island and would be considered ‘near to areas of dense population’ according to the SASB definition set out on page 18 of the standard (https://www.sasb.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Electric_Utilities_Power_ Generators_Standard_2018.pdf). 4. We submit CDP Climate Change and CDP Water questionnaires annually to CDP in August. Our submissions can be viewed on the CDP website: https://www.cdp.net/en/responses?utf8=%E2%9C%93&queries%5Bname%5D=national+grid.

Electric Utilities & Power Generators Standard continued 5. Disclosure not applicable to our UK business (transmission only and not customer facing). National Grid publish their own UK energy affordability metrics in the RBR to disclose our contribution to consumer bills – see pages 30 to 33 and page 62. Data stated for this disclosure in this SASB Index is representative of our US business only. 6. National Grid have reported lost time injury frequency rate and number of fatalities as key safety metrics for many years. For 2020/21 we will report consistently with our historic reporting. We recognise that these metrics are not the precise SASB required disclosures, but are very similar. 7. The Revenue Decoupling Mechanism (RDM) considers changes in revenue for factors including energy efficiency (EE), the economy, weather, etc. With the introduction of RDMs, which predominantly were intended to remove the roadblock for utilities to fully promote EE but encompass all influences on sales, LRAMs no longer became necessary. All lost revenue from programs that serve to reduce customer load (EE, Distributed Generation (DG)) is recovered through RDM unless they are specifically excluded. In NE, there are no exclusions in our RDMs for EE or DG. 8. We do not currently have data available for this metric for 2020/21 reporting but aim to disclose this next year (2021/22). 9. There is not comparable data available for the UK business. Number of MWh lost, and length of interruptions is measured by the Distribution Network Operators (DNOs) to monitor performance, not by National Grid (UK business is transmission only).

11. Our NE operations (Boston, Colonial and RI) have a full Revenue Decoupling Mechanism (RDM), which considers changes in revenue from all factors (energy efficiency, the economy, weather, etc.), so therefore we do not have a separate LRAM. Our NE operations are not 100% decoupled because we do not include new, large or extra large commercial and industrial (C&I) customers. We retain revenue billed to such customers, whether higher or lower than the RDM fixed revenue per customer (RPC) as determined in a rate case. 12. Massachusetts (MA) includes Boston and Colonial operating companies. We do not report customer gas savings separately for Boston and Colonial. 13. Both incidents reported were associated with the US business. In the UK there was 1 pipeline incident in 2020, however as no there was 0 leakage associated with the incident, it would therefore not be counted under the SASB definition. 14. National Grid’s UK gas business is transmission only (no distribution pipeline). This disclosure is representative of our US business only.
