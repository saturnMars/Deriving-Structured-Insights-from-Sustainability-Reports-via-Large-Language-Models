OUR COMPANY


4 PARK HOTELS & RESORTS CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2021 safety and environmental standards in this evolving operating environment, and I am very proud of our team’s efforts, which are described in more detail in this report.
Despite the temporary suspension of operations at 85% of our portfolio, we continued with established plans for essential maintenance, environmental analysis and risk assessment. We prioritized necessary back-of-house maintenance of equipment and systems, as our engineering team and hotel management partners worked to improve the efficiency of our buildings through upgrades to mechanical equipment, including HVAC systems, building automation systems and cooling towers. These upgrades contributed to reductions in energy consumption and carbon emissions during 2020. We also took advantage of operational downtime by collaborating with industry peers on engineering best practices and refining our key performance indicators and expectations going forward.
Since Park was established as a separate, independent company in 2017, we have maintained an aggressive energy efficiency investment strategy. Exemplifying the results of this strategy, four of our properties were awarded the ENERGY STAR® Certification for Superior Energy Efficiency in 2020 – an impressive feat during an extremely challenging year when only 26 hotels nationwide were awarded this annual certification. In addition, our team worked throughout 2020 to analyze the portfolio’s current emission levels and establish thoughtful emissions reduction targets to drive our internal goals. We hope to be able to share these goals publicly as we move past the disruption of data caused by the pandemic. Finally, we continued to prioritize a number of proactive risk assessments across our portfolio related to climate change, including sea level rise assessments in some coastal markets where our properties are located. We will share some examples of these proactive assessments in this Report.
Turning to social aspects, the pandemic has had significant implications on our human capital strategies. We shifted to remote work for all corporate associates that desired to work from home throughout 2020. For those associates who preferred to work in our headquarters office in Tysons, Virginia, we re-opened the office in mid-2020 with strict safety measures in place, in accordance with CDC and local health guidelines. Shifting the vast majority of our work to a remote capacity for an extended period has posed new. 
Park Hotels & Resorts Inc. (“Park” or the “Company”) is pleased to publish our fourth annual Corporate Responsibility Report (“Report”), which highlights our 2020 Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) program and initiatives. 2020 was defined by the global COVID-19 pandemic, which largely halted travel and tourism and had significant effects on Park and our stakeholders. Although the various challenges posed by COVID-19 were unprecedented in nature, the Company’s established ESG framework guided efforts to protect our assets and support our stakeholders throughout the pandemic. As we continue to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic and plan for the future, we strongly believe that consistently upholding Park’s corporate responsibility principles is critical to supporting both our business and our stakeholders as we continue along this path toward recovery.
From an environmental perspective, 2020 was a year of “firsts” for our portfolio. In March 2020, restrictions and shelter-in-place orders related to COVID-19 caused us to temporarily suspend operations at 38 of our hotels (85% of portfolio-wide rooms). While these suspensions reduced our consumption of energy and water and generation of GHG emissions and waste, they also presented an opportunity for new environmental efforts to address the continuously evolving understanding of the virus causing COVID-19, such as enhanced standards for indoor air quality and new protocols for building maintenance. Our team worked tirelessly throughout 2020 to ensure maintenance of optimal health,
LETTER FROM OUR CHAIRMAN AND CEO.

SINCE PARK WAS ESTABLISHED AS A SEPARATE, INDEPENDENT COMPANY IN 2017, WE HAVE MAINTAINED AN AGGRESSIVE ENERGY EFFICIENCY INVESTMENT STRATEGY

Our Company challenges for engagement and wellbeing. The Company’s dedicated Human Resources department has supported our associates by enhancing the wellness program through a series of initiatives, including virtual sessions led by thought leaders in mental health and emotional intelligence; virtual “Wellness Wednesdays” activities such as yoga, meditation, healthy eating guidance and physical exercise; and care packages mailed to associates’ homes to help enliven our employees’ home office environment. We also maintained our commitment to fostering a diverse and inclusive working environment through the continued efforts of our Diversity and Inclusion Steering Committee and annual diversity and inclusion training, which was undertaken by all property and corporate associates.
On the governance side, we continue to oversee our ESG initiatives and policies as part of our established ESG decision-making framework. Park currently has three dedicated ESG committees: the Green Park Committee, the Park Cares Committee and the Diversity and Inclusion Steering Committee. Each of these Committees entail Executive Committeelevel oversight, which subsequently report up to myself and also the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors. In addition, Executive Committee leaders report at least annually to Park’s Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on the Company’s enterprise risk management. These reports cover topics such as climate-related and cybersecurity risks, as well as other aspects of our risk management strategy. Our approaches are further described in our first Task Force on Climaterelated Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”) report, which is included as an appendix to this Report.
We remain dedicated to transparency and reporting of our ESG approaches and achievements in alignment with globally recognized sustainability frameworks and standards, such as the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”), the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (“SASB”), the UN Sustainable Development Goals (“SDGs”) and TCFD. In 2021, we submitted our second Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark (“GRESB”) real estate assessment, with data for our portfolio for fiscal year 2020. We believe that such transparency and disclosure help to align Park’s priorities with our interested stakeholders.
As always, we welcome feedback and the opportunity to discuss our ESG efforts with our stakeholders. We thank you for your interest in our Corporate Responsibility program, and we hope to welcome you to our properties in the near future.

Company Overview. 
Our Company. 
Our corporate strategy is to consistently deliver superior, risk-adjusted returns to stockholders through active asset management and a thoughtful external growth strategy, while maintaining a strong and flexible balance sheet. The following are the three key pillars of our corporate strategy:
OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE THROUGH ACTIVE ASSET MANAGEMENT We are focused on continually improving property level operating performance through our proactive asset management efforts. We consistently implement revenue management initiatives to optimize market pricing and segment mix, while also focusing on appropriate cost-saving measures.
PRUDENT CAPITAL ALLOCATION We intend to leverage our scale, liquidity and mergers and acquisitions expertise to create value throughout all phases of the lodging cycle through opportunistic acquisitions, dispositions and/or corporate transactions, which we believe will enable us to further diversify our portfolio.
STRONG AND FLEXIBLE BALANCE SHEET We expect to maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet that will enable us to navigate the various seasons of the lodging cycle. We expect to maintain strong liquidity across the lodging cycle and access to multiple types of financing, including corporate bonds and credit facilities.
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY CONSIDERATIONS IN OUR CORPORATE STRATEGY PILLARS Our Corporate Responsibility strategy is embedded in each of our three pillars. Owning hotels and resorts requires proactive expense oversight in order to achieve operational excellence. Utility consumption, for example, poses a significant cost to our business, and long-term asset management planning is required to ensure that our properties are on the right trajectory for reducing our environmental footprint. Reduction to Park’s environmental footprint is made possible through prudent capital allocation, investing in efficiency ROI projects, benchmarking and reporting, as well as the integration of sustainability across our portfolio. Finally, access to a strong and flexible balance sheet enables Park to weather all phases of the lodging cycle by prioritizing necessary ESG investments and strategies, as well as executing acquisitions and dispositions that fit Park’s long-term ESG goals. We believe that our three corporate strategy pillars and strong Corporate Responsibility framework will contribute to Park’s success in generating superior, risk-adjusted returns to stockholders.
Park is the second largest publicly traded US lodging REIT, comprised of a geographically diverse portfolio of hotels and resorts with significant underlying real estate value. As of the time of Park’s 2020 annual report filing, Park owned 60 premium hotels and resorts located in 17 states as well as the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, representing over 33,000 rooms across the United States.

Governance and Oversight. 
Our Company. 
ESG Decision Making Framework. 
Park has an established ESG decision-making framework that drives the oversight of ESG-related issues. Park currently has three dedicated ESG committees – the Green Park Committee, the Park Cares Committee and the Diversity and Inclusion Steering Committee. These committees are comprised of corporate associates and senior management across various departments of the organization, and each committee has at least one Executive Committee leader as part of its team. Each committee specializes in specific ESG matters and provides both written and verbal updates to our Chairman of the Board and CEO, Thomas J. Baltimore, Jr., at least on a quarterly basis. Our Chairman and CEO is ultimately responsible for our ESG decision making. In addition and at least annually, Executive Committee leaders provide ESG reporting and strategy updates to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors (“NCG Committee”), which is the Park Board Committee tasked with ESG oversight. Furthermore, Executive Committee leaders report at least annually to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on Park’s enterprise risk management, including discussions regarding climate-related risks, cybersecurity risks and other elements of risk management strategy. ESG matters are routinely discussed among Park’s Executive Committee leaders.
GREEN PARK COMMITTEE Our Green Park Committee consists of corporate associates and senior leadership across various departments of the Company as well as external energy consultants. Led by our Executive Vice President, Design & Construction and his team, the committee meets on a quarterly basis to discuss strategies on how to manage Park’s environmental performance and objectives. In 2020, the Green Park Committee launched the Green Park Program, which is a corporate commitment to achieving environmental sustainability. The Green Park Program includes a centralized infrastructure for standardized reporting of environmental emissions and efficiency projects by property and on a portfolio-wide basis; proactive sustainability communications to Park’s internal stakeholders; and the Green Park Sustainability Playbook. The Playbook is a detailed sustainability “how-to” guide for all Park’s properties, including information on sustainability best practices and sustainability expectations by operational department. In 2021, the Green Park Committee began implementing monthly webinars on topics included in the Playbook, as well as information on relevant and timely sustainability issues. These webinars are directed toward property-level General Managers and Directors of Engineering, providing the Green Park Committee with the opportunity to have direct engagement with Park’s brand and management partners who are tasked with implementing sustainability at our hotels.
The Green Park Committee has developed short, medium and long term sustainability improvement plans for the Company, with internal targeted energy consumption metrics across the portfolio.

PARK CARES COMMITTEE At Park, we believe it is essential to be responsible corporate citizens by investing in and giving back to our communities. To lead our community engagement efforts, Park established the Park Cares Committee, which coordinates volunteering events, development programs and donations. This cross-departmental committee is led by our Executive Vice President, Human Resources and meets on a quarterly basis.
ESG Decision Making Framework (continued)
DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION STEERING COMMITTEE In order to advance our social objectives related to diversity, equity and inclusion in the wake of the widespread racial reckoning movement in mid-2020, Park established the Diversity and Inclusion Steering Committee. The committee is comprised of Park associates from all levels of the Company and is led by our Executive Vice President, Human Resources. This committee aims to increase awareness and accelerate action and inclusivity related to diversity and equity throughout our business operations. The committee, alongside the entire organization, continues to work to foster a diverse and inclusive organization.

While non-essential capital expenditure projects were largely suspended or cancelled during 2020 due to cost elimination and cash efficiency measures taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we continued to invest in efficiency projects related to end-of-life equipment replacements or upgrades. With these projects, we were often able to notably decrease our environmental impact by replacing older equipment with more efficient options. In addition, to optimize the periods of asset downtime, Park’s engineering department conducted select performance reviews of the portfolio’s existing equipment, such.

During the height of the COVID-19 related mandatory quarantines and “shelter-in-place” orders, we temporarily suspended operations at 38 of our hotels. There are many operational challenges related to suspending and then reopening large hotel facilities, including building water circulation. If water is not routinely circulated, it can stagnate and grow large amounts of harmful bacteria, such as Legionella. To address this risk, Park developed a framework detailing how frequently water circulation must occur during periods of suspension in order to maintain adequate property health and safety standards. This water. 
Health and Safety Across our Portfolio During COVID-19. 
RESPONSIBILITY IN ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT circulation framework was utilized at all of our temporarily suspended hotels and involved procedures for flushing the domestic water system at every outlet and protocol for hyper-chlorinating water systems at hotels that have been suspended for long periods of time. At Park’s Hilton-branded properties, testing was increased from an annual basis to a monthly basis in order to promptly identify the presence of Legionella bacteria. Park’s efforts have helped to ensure the health and safety of our hotel employees and guests as our buildings have reopened for business.
Portfolio Sustainability Standardization. 
As part of our capital recycling program, we actively engage in merger and acquisition activity that results in changes to our portfolio. These portfolio changes, particularly portfolio additions, create a specific challenge to environmental management. Newly acquired assets may not possess sustainability characteristics which align with our sustainability expectations. To standardize our asset-level sustainability expectations, Park created the Green Park Sustainability Playbook. Our engineering department partners with the brand and management companies to upgrade and maintain asset characteristics in alignment with the Green Sustainability Playbook. Provided to the staff of each of our third-party property management companies, the Playbook outlines our sustainability expectations and processes for an array of topics, including the following:
Our engineering team hosts quarterly Playbook informational sessions for our hotels to facilitate discussion, education and collaboration across our properties and operators.
Certain sustainability components such as green building materials and water efficiency standards can only be addressed during the renovation or construction phase of an asset’s life cycle. In 2020, Park’s engineering team created its Engineering Renovation Guidelines, which address opportunities for incorporating sustainable building attributes during renovations. The Engineering Renovation Guidelines covers a wide variety of asset attributes, including:
LED LIGHTING. 
HVAC EQUIPMENT.

We are committed to providing a safe, healthy, equitable and inclusive environment for our associates, who are a key stakeholder in our business and critical for our prolonged success. We strive to develop strong relationships with the local communities where our properties are located and support and develop these communities through volunteering and in-kind and cash donations.
SOCIAL STRATEGY. 
Responsibility in Social Commitment. 
Park’s associates make up the fabric of our organization and are critical to ensuring the success of our Company. As our most valuable corporate asset(s), it is imperative that we provide a safe, supportive and inclusive working environment for all our associates. We have developed and implemented programs that support these characteristics, including our health and wellbeing program and our annual trainings. Furthermore, Park places high importance on cultivating a strong and positive relationship with the local communities where we work and own properties. We seek to engage with the community through volunteering as well as in-kind and cash donations as identified by the Park Cares Committee.
As the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic rapidly expanded in March 2020, Park proactively closed its corporate headquarters in early March to allow all Park associates below the Senior Executive level to work remotely on a full-time basis to help protect the health and safety of our associates and their families. After much planning and evaluation of the science and the then-current governmental guidelines, by the second half of 2020, we opened our corporate office to a handful of associates who voluntarily opted to work in the office under strict health and safety guidelines. We have continued to allow our corporate associates to work from home as their health and safety remains our top priority.
To support our associates during this unique and challenging period, we enhanced components of our health and wellbeing program to address our changing environment and increased anxiety given the uncertain state of the world. Our expanded program has included Wellness Wednesdays, an initiative targeted to improve physical, social, mental and spiritual wellbeing through weekly Company-wide virtual events. These Wellness Wednesdays have included a variety of exercises and topics, including the following:

Advancing Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. 
Responsibility in Social Commitment. 
We pride ourselves on creating a respectful, professional and inclusive workplace for our associates. We value the unique perspectives that a workforce with diverse cultures, ages, genders and ethnicities brings to our culture. We embrace this diversity that we strongly feel enhances our success.
To advance our social objectives related to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), Park established a Diversity and Inclusion Steering Committee in 2020. This committee aims to increase awareness and accelerate inclusivity throughout our business operations and also carry out our commitment to the CEO Action For Diversity & InclusionTM pledge that Park signed in 2019. Since its formation, the committee has continued to meet monthly and work thoughtfully in evaluating our current and prospective initiatives and partnerships to ensure they align with Park’s culture and support our diversity and inclusion mission.
Park continues to partner with many local organizations that provide services and resources to underserved populations and those in need of social, economic, educational, mental and physical support in our community. Examples of organizations that we proudly support and that are aligned with Park’s diversity and inclusion mission include the following: Don Bosco Cristo Rey, N Street Village, Castell Project, Arlington Partnership for Affordable Housing, Arlington Free Clinic, Bridges, and KEEN Greater DC-Baltimore.
The Diversity and Inclusion Steering Committee has also spent significant time focusing on actions and commitments that impact Park internally such as: recruitment & retention practices, policy and process updates, training and increased communication and awareness programs. Park strongly views these focus areas as essential in delivering our goal of creating a more diverse and inclusive culture within Park. Below are actions we are taking to enhance our current Park practices and commitment to a culture of diversity, equity and inclusion:
Recruitment: Commitment to broaden candidate searches to actively pursue a diverse slate of candidates for every open role, for which we recruit externally, with a goal of increasing diversity hires.
6 Include historically black colleges and universities to the list of colleges where we post available positions.
6 Post available positions on the internal job board of INROADS, a non-profit organization aimed at creating pathways to careers for ethnically diverse high school and college students.
PARK HOTELS & RESORTS DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION MISSION STATEMENT.

Responsibility in Risk Management. 
We monitor risk and potential impacts of climate change to our properties located in hurricane prone states, coastal regions and water stressed areas. Furthermore, our risk management incorporates assessing the extreme weather effects such as droughts, floods and hurricanes, along with sea level rise that are forecasted to increase in frequency and severity over time. To consistently meet the standards outlined in our Environmental Policy, we conduct regular risk assessments across the portfolio, with more detailed assessment based on asset location, condition and history for a variety of factors including: 6 Biodiversity and Habitat 6 Building Safety and Materials 6 Energy Efficiency 6 Energy Supply 6 Flooding 6 GHG Emissions 6 Indoor Environmental Quality 6 Natural Hazards 6 Regulations 6 Transportation 6 Waste Management 6 Water Efficiency 6 Water Supply. 
We incorporate climate risk assessment as part of our due diligence for potential property and portfolio acquisitions, as well as into our plans for property improvements. Park then conducts regular technical assessments of our portfolio’s energy efficiency, water efficiency and waste stream capabilities to maintain and increase efficiency. To address the impacts of natural disaster events in our standing portfolio, among other potential emergency situations, Park developed its Risk Binder. This Binder details a chronological set of property-level risk management procedures to be undertaken within the first 72 hours of an extreme weather event or other emergency. These standardized procedures seek to ensure the health and safety of associates and guests, prevent asset down-time and maximize asset valuations through damage minimization.
WATER STRESSED AREAS 10.5% of our portfolio is located in areas of high or extremely high-water stress.
FLOOD ZONES 5.1% of our portfolio is in a 100-year flood zone area.
HURRICANE PRONE STATES The 4 most hurricane prone states in the U.S. are Florida, Texas, North Carolina and Louisiana. 17% of our portfolio is located in three of these states.

We are proud to own iconic properties located in beautiful coastal destinations such as Hawaii, Key West, Miami and Puerto Rico. As part of these ownership responsibilities, we understand our obligation to protect our real estate assets in an environmentally sound manner. As the effects of climate change continue to increase and impact the world’s ecosystem, we continue to monitor the potential for sea level rise and flooding from tidal events.
Park continues to periodically conduct long-term sea level rise studies on its largest asset, the 2,860-room Hilton Hawaiian Village Waikiki Beach Resort. As part of the studies, our Design & Construction team works with third party specialists to conduct topographical study modeling and develop best-case and worse-case scenario planning. When the iconic hotel was constructed in the 1950s, different standards and environmental considerations impacted the design of the hotel. As such, many of the hotel’s critical mechanical equipment and facilities are located. 
CASE STUDY. 
Climate Risk (continued) below grade. Part of Park’s long-term planning for this asset includes measures to protect this equipment from flooding due to sea level rise. Potential long-term solutions include the relocation of the critical equipment, the construction of sea walls, the fortification of building structures and changing the elevation of the surrounding land.
In Key West, our two resorts face similar challenges as these properties are also prone to climate-related flooding risks. King tides are the highest predicted high tide of the year at a coastal location. While king tides are normal occurrences once or twice a year, the effects of climate change and sea level rise have caused these tides to become even larger. We continue to study the occurrence of king tides in Key West and monitor the changing high-water threshold needed to ensure our resorts remain safe and protected from potential flooding risks.

PERFORMANCE TABLES (continued)
Appendix A: Performance Tables 10 Energy and water performance data were compiled via utility data management service and separate consultants to compile, validate and calendarize data directly from utility provider data feeds. For a handful of properties not encompassed by that system and for waste performance, data capture was supplemented by pulls from either operator system outputs or direct collection via property teams. Performance data is compiled by a separate entity which performs validity testing and compilation, including the greenhouse gas emissions inventory, which are then cross-checked by the utility management consultants. Specific instances of restatement, exclusion or extrapolation can be found in the other footnotes in this section.
11 Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, occupied rooms dramatically decreased during 2020. In alignment with Park’s health and safety protocol, we maintained a continuous flow of water across our portfolio, irrespective of occupancy levels, which dramatically skewed our water intensity statistic. Looking forward, we expect a relative return to normalcy to our water intensity in FY 2021.
12 Waste data was not extrapolated/estimated; data reported only for properties with available data. 2017 waste metrics represent approximately 83% of total floor area, 2018 waste metrics represent approximately 97% of total floor area, 2019 waste metrics represent 99.7% of total floor area and 2020 waste metrics represent 90% of total floor area.

DISCLOSURE RESPONSE. 
Board’s oversight of climate related risks and opportunities Park has an established ESG decision-making framework that drives our oversight of ESG-related matters. Park currently has three dedicated ESG committees – the Green Park Committee, the Park Cares Committee, and the Diversity and Inclusion Steering Committee. These committees are comprised of employees and senior management across various departments of our organization, and each committee has at least one Executive Committee leader as part of its team. Each committee specializes on specific ESG matters and provides both written and verbal updates to our Chairman of the Board and CEO, Thomas J. Baltimore, Jr., at least on a quarterly basis. Our Chairman and CEO is ultimately responsible for our ESG decision making. In addition and at least annually, Executive Committee leaders provide ESG reporting and strategy updates to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors, which is the Park Board Committee tasked with ESG oversight. Furthermore, Executive Committee leaders report at least annually to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on Park’s enterprise risk management, including discussions regarding climate-related risks, cybersecurity risks and other elements of risk management strategy.
Management’s role in assessing and managing climate related risks and opportunities. 
Park’s management ensures that responsibilities are assigned and communicated within the organization to assess and manage climate related risks and opportunities. While there are three dedicated ESG committees, assessing and managing climate related risks and opportunities is primarily managed by the Green Park Committee, internal Environmental Management System and the identified individual roles (described below).
The Green Park Committee focuses on identifying, assessing and implementing energy and sustainability projects as well as reporting standardization, benchmarking and sustainability communications throughout the portfolio. The Committee consists of members from several disciplines, including Design & Construction, Asset Management and Finance, as well as external energy consultants. The broader Committee meets quarterly, and representatives meet at least monthly. The Green Park Committee produces a monthly newsletter, which is sent to all Park properties, that includes portfolio data and benchmarking as well as trends in sustainability. The Committee also conducts quarterly webinars.
Park’s internal Environmental Management System (“EMS”) provides guidance in upholding our Corporate Responsibility Framework and Strategy, by acting responsibly across three areas: risk mitigation, environmental management and social commitment.
Identified individual roles with oversight of the company’s climate related risks include: 6 Executive Vice President, Design & Construction - Responsible for overseeing Park’s efforts to assess and manage climate related risks and opportunities 6 Vice President, Design & Construction Engineering - Responsible for implementation and oversight of climate related risks and opportunities 6 Sr. Director of Engineering - Responsible for implementation of the Green Park Sustainability Playbook across Park’s properties; corporate sustainability initiatives; and energy procurement 6 Sr. Director of Engineering - Responsible for risk management across Park’s portfolio 6 Directors of Engineering at the properties - Responsible for implementing and documenting all energy, water, and sustainability projects at their respective properties.

DISCLOSURE RESPONSE RISK OPPORTUNITIES. 
Impact on business, strategy and financial planning As the second largest publicly traded lodging REIT in the United States and the owner of 60 properties across the United States as of February 26, 2021, Park faces different challenges and risks that can manifest in many forms. Some risks that Park monitors include the impact of our large environmental footprint, health and safety concerns for our associates and property guests, changes to our assets’ valuations and our brand reputation. These risks involve and affect a variety of stakeholder groups, including Park associates, guests, investors, properties and the communities where our properties are located. As Park recognizes and appreciates the impact of both the various risks related to our business and effect of such risks to our various stakeholders, Park continually strives to manage and mitigate such risks and any negative impact from our operations.
Environmental factors impact our company’s business operations; therefore, the scope of our internal EMS is widespread. Our EMS is utilized at both the corporate and property level to address climate risks and opportunities that meet the interests and expectations of our stakeholders. Our portfolio includes assets located in hurricane prone states, coastal regions and water stressed areas. Furthermore, extreme weather effects such as droughts, flooding, hurricanes and sea level rise are forecasted to become more frequent and more severe as the effects of climate change accelerate. Park understands that minimizing our environmental footprint and mitigating the potential negative impact of climate related events on our portfolio is critical to helping ensure the long-lasting success of our Company and to satisfying the needs of our stakeholders.
Energy efficiency is a key component to our strategy as a property owner, not only for the capital expenditure and operating costs it represents, but also as the Company’s primary source of GHG emissions. As such, energy assessments are routinely conducted as part of our operating practices. These cover indoor air quality, evaluating the operation of energy consuming equipment, and analyzing energy consumption data in pursuit of maintaining and improving performance. During our property site visits, professional engineers evaluate energy efficiency in spaces such as guestrooms, guest bathrooms, kitchens, food and beverage outlets, back of house / mechanical areas, banquet and meeting rooms, fitness centers, spas and swimming pools, garages and building exteriors. As part of the Green Park program, ASHRAE Level II audits are planned for each property within the next 5 years.
Organizational resilience and Impact of different scenarios, including 2 degrees or lower. 
Our strategy incorporates two assumptions of a long term 2 degree or lower scenario.
First, even in keeping in pace with the Paris Agreement and other policy decisions, the impacts of climate change will increase over time and may alter key markets and travel destinations. This may result in Park needing to rethink current and future investments in key markets, incorporating higher costs of owning buildings into its operating budget, and adapting to shifts in travel patterns affected by extreme weather.
Second, as much of the world collectively works to decarbonize by 2050, we understand that there could be significant implications from such decarbonization efforts for society and our business. In particular, our planning for pursuing net zero requires both systemic changes in a building’s energy sources and distribution and acceptance of altered expectations from both business and leisure guests regarding the practices and performance of a hotel. Park is currently evaluating pathways toward transitioning our business operations to net zero, while maintaining the best interests of our stakeholders.
Investments in low carbon opportunities Park maintains a strong investment strategy in environmental efficiency projects across our portfolio. These investments include technology such as renewable energy, fuel switching and other market-based opportunities for lowering carbon footprints.

DISCLOSURE RESPONSE. 
Process for identifying and assessing climate related risks Park’s EMS provides guidance throughout our organization on how to uphold our corporate responsibility framework and strategy by acting responsibly across three areas: risk mitigation, environmental management and social commitment. Success in managing these areas directly supports the key pillars of our corporate strategy: achieving operational excellence, prudently allocating capital and maintaining a strong and flexible balance sheet. Ultimately, we believe our corporate pillars will allow us to deliver superior, risk-adjusted returns to stockholders. Our EMS guides how we address the identified environmental risks and opportunities, namely, through utilizing a Plan, Do, Check, Act system in alignment with ISO 14001.
Processes for managing climate related risks Park aims to identify and mitigate ESG risks throughout all aspects of our business. Park assesses ESG risks and opportunities by (i) engaging with key stakeholders to understand their priorities and (ii) performing thorough assessments on existing hotel properties. On an annual basis, our Design & Construction Department reviews existing hotel properties for sustainability, energy efficiency and climate impact opportunities. These assessments are completed with internal and external resources and become actionable on a best value basis. Risk assessments are also performed during the due diligence process for new acquisitions, and property condition assessments are commissioned during the due diligence process for dispositions.
As is typical with lodging REITs, all of Park’s properties are managed by third-party operators who handle the day-to-day operations and implementation of controls for each hotel. As such, Park has limited control over the day-to-day operations within a hotel. Park can, however, influence and control building related investments and best practices that aim to mitigate both environmental impacts and climate related risks and also improve efficiency. As part of our Green Park program, we have developed tools and communications to engage and collaborate with our third-party operators. Such tools include the development of a Green Park Sustainability Playbook which covers relevant topics to advance sustainability and address environmental risk. Park also relies on its proprietary Property Risk Management Binder, which is designed to guide the incident response process for property damage scenarios. This binder addresses risks related to flooding, fire, storm damage, exterior structural damage, earthquake, tornado, civil disturbance, terrorism and biohazards.
The Green Park Committee also conducts quarterly webinars to focus on sustainability-related operational improvement. Additionally, on a monthly basis, the Green Park Committee sends a “Green Park Newsletter” with the latest utility and emissions reporting to our third-party operators. This newsletter allows the Committee to prioritize sites for evaluation, check progress, recognize achievements and discuss relevant trends in sustainability. The Green Park Committee meets regularly with our third-party operators to review sustainability performance. Finally, during the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been increased attention on modifying hotels and building operations to ensure a healthy and safe environment.
Integration into overall risk management As part of its enterprise risk management, Park senior management at least annually presents an update to the Audit Committee on identified top risks of the Company, the likelihood of such risk and the impact of such perceived risk. The Audit Committee reviews and discusses enterprise risk each year.
To ensure appropriate data collection and facilitate well-informed decision making, Park monitors potential risks and impacts of climate change to our properties located in hurricane prone states, coastal regions and water stressed areas. Risk management incorporates assessing the extreme weather effects such as droughts, floods and hurricanes, along with sea level rise that are forecasted to increase in frequency and severity over time. To consistently meet the standards outlined in our Environmental Policy, we conduct regular risk assessments across our portfolio, with more detailed assessment based on asset location, condition and history for a variety of factors including: 6 Biodiversity and Habitat 6 Building Safety and Materials 6 Energy Efficiency 6 Energy Supply 6 Flooding 6 GHG Emissions 6 Indoor Environmental Quality 6 Natural Hazards 6 Regulatory 6 Transportation 6 Waste Management 6 Water Efficiency 6 Water Supply.
