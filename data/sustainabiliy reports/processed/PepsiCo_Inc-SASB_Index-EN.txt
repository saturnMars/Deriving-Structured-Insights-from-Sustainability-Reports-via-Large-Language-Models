This report marks the second time PepsiCo has reported in alignment with the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) standards. We have reported the disclosures related to the two sectors that are most closely aligned to our business: Processed Foods and Non-Alcoholic Beverages. In certain instances, and as noted throughout this index, a specific SASB topic may be discussed generally in our ESG Report but we do not report on the corresponding SASB metric. In addition, certain disclosures may not be fully aligned with SASB’s definition, but represent the closest approximation possible. Unless otherwise noted, our sustainability data reflects progress made during the calendar year (ending December 31), whereas our financial reporting corresponds with our fiscal year, which varies slightly from year-to-year. We are constantly evaluating our goals and progress, assessing the technical and regulatory challenges we face in achieving our ambitious objectives, and innovating new ways to keep moving forward, which may impact goals referenced in this index. Inclusion of information in this index should not be construed as a characterization of the materiality or financial impact of that information. Please see our Form 10-K for the financial year ended December 25, 2021 and other publicly-filed documents, which are available at www.pepsico.com/investors/investor-relations.

Approximately 50% of our key ingredients were sustainably-sourced, including more than 90% of growersourced crops. For grower-sourced crops, sustainable sourcing refers to meeting the independently verified environmental, social and economic principles of PepsiCo’s Sustainable Farming Program (SFP). For suppliersourced crops, sustainable sourcing is achieved through a third party standard that has been benchmarked as equivalent to the SFP or, in limited regions, a continuous improvement program addressing the main environmental and social risks with growing the relevant crop.
