2021 ESG PERFORMANCE REPORT 2. 
Caution regarding forward-looking statements. 
From time to time, Royal Bank of Canada and its subsidiaries (RBC, we , us or our) make written or oral forward-looking statements within the meaning of certain securities laws, including the “safe harbour” provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and any applicable Canadian securities legislation. We may make forward-looking statements in this Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Performance Report 2021 (the Report), in other filings with Canadian regulators or the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), in other reports to shareholders and in other communications. Forward-looking statements in this document include, but are not limited to, statements relating to our vision, commitments, goals and targets, as well as our economic, environmental, social and governance-related impacts and objectives. We have included forward-looking information in this document to assist our stakeholders in understanding our vision, commitments, goals and targets, as well as our economic, environmental, social and governance-related impacts and objectives. This information may not be appropriate for other purposes. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as “believe”, “expect”, "expectation", "aim", “foresee”, “forecast”, “anticipate”, "predict", “intend”, “estimate”, "commit", “goal”, “plan”, “strive”, "objective", “target”, and “project” and similar expressions of future or conditional verbs such as “will”, “may”, “should”, “could” or “would”.
By their very nature, forward-looking statements require us to make assumptions and are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties, which give rise to the possibility that our predictions, forecasts, projections, expectations or conclusions will not prove to be accurate, that our assumptions may not be correct and that our vision, commitments, goals and targets, and economic, environmental, social and governance-related impacts and objectives will not be achieved. We caution readers not to place undue reliance on these statements as a number of risk factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed in such forward-looking statements. These factors – many of which are beyond our control and the effects of which can be difficult to predict – include climate-related conditions and weather events, our ability to gather and verify data and successfully implement various initiatives throughout the company under expected time frames, the compliance of various third parties with our policies and procedures, the legal and regulatory environment, regulatory compliance (which could lead us to being subject to various legal and regulatory proceedings, the potential outcome of which could include regulatory restrictions, penalties and fines), strategic, reputation, competitive, legal and regulatory environment, and systemic risks and other risks discussed in the risk sections and Impact of COVID-19 pandemic section of our Annual Report for the year ended October 31, 2021 (2021 Annual Report) and the Risk management section of our Quarterly Report for the three-month period that ended January 31, 2022 (Q1 2022 Report to Shareholders). In addition, as we work to advance our climate goals, external factors outside of RBC’s reasonable control may act as constraints on their achievement, including varying decarbonization efforts across economies, the need for thoughtful climate policies around the world, more and better data, reasonably supported methodologies, technological advancements, the evolution of consumer behaviour, the challenges of balancing interim emission reduction targets with an orderly and just transition, and other significant considerations such as legal and regulatory obligations.
We caution that the foregoing list of risk factors is not exhaustive and other factors could also adversely affect our results. When relying on our forwardlooking statements to make decisions with respect to us, investors and others should carefully consider the foregoing factors and other uncertainties and potential events. Material economic assumptions underlying the forwardlooking statements contained in this document are set out in the Economic, market and regulatory review and outlook section and for each business segment under the Strategic priorities and Outlook headings in our 2021 Annual Report, as updated by the Economic, market and regulatory review and outlook section in our Q1 2022 Report to Shareholders. Except as required by law, we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time by us or on our behalf. While certain matters discussed in this document may be significant, any significance should not be read as necessarily rising to the level of materiality used for the purposes of complying with securities laws and regulations, even if we use the word “ material”.
Additional information about these and other factors can be found in the risk sections and Impact of COVID-19 pandemic section of our 2021 Annual Report and in the Risk management section of our Q1 2022 Report to Shareholders.

CEO Message. 
Tackling climate change presents a big challenge and an even greater opportunity, one that will impact all of our lives and those of generations to come. Global plans to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net-zero by 2050 require the largest change to our economies in our lifetime, and one that the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC®) is fully committed to supporting.
At RBC, we’re convinced of the merits of a sustainable, net-zero future, and the RBC Climate Blueprint is our plan for how we can get there. It is designed to guide us, working with our clients and communities, to contribute to a healthier planet and more prosperous and inclusive economy for the 21st century. Because we believe it’s the smart choice.
The financial system needs to be leading efforts to accelerate clean economic growth and the transition to the net-zero economy. Climate change is already a business reality for our clients, and many have embraced new ways of doing business and reframed climate action as an opportunity to improve and expand what they do.
We believe that capital can be a force for positive change, clearly demonstrated by our target of $500 billion in sustainable financing by 2025, the largest commitment in Canada. This goal supports investments in companies and projects that are widely recognized as contributing to the sustainable economy of the future.
This approach to sustainability is central to our business and to our stated Purpose, to help clients thrive and communities prosper. We know we can do this by taking the best of what we have today – our human resources and natural resources – to build a better tomorrow. The choice belongs to all of us.

2021 ESG PERFORMANCE REPORT 6. 
CEO Message. 
Creating our shared future is a shared responsibility. For our part, RBC is contributing to a more inclusive, sustainable and prosperous future. And we do so by harnessing the power of Purpose. That means fully leveraging our resources, capabilities and influence to help address issues that matter most to those we serve.
It is evident in the way we create meaningful value through our focus on Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG). Our aim is to tackle some of society’s greatest challenges in the communities where we live and work. To do so, we integrate ESG into our strategies and operations, which enables us to align our actions with the broader aspirations of our stakeholders. We offer tailored solutions, insights and advice and bring forward broader industry learnings and thought leadership to make a meaningful impact. And, in all cases, we set ambitious goals and measure our progress to ensure we are accountable for our actions and our outcomes are transparent.
Through our efforts in 2021 we continued to earn top rankings on key priority ESG indices. This Report brings to life the initiatives behind our performance. I want to highlight four areas of focus where we harnessed the power of our Purpose to better serve our employees, clients, communities and the planet.
Enabling our employees to thrive in a rapidly evolving world of work Profound and pervasive changes are taking place in workplaces around the world. Our aim is to remain an employer of choice in this new world and, to do so, we continuously invest in our people and their future success, as well as sustain a strong and caring culture that attracts and retains top talent.
In our learning and development programs, for instance, we’re focused on future skills, such as adaptability, creativity and problem-solving, to enable employees to thrive regardless of where they work and what they do. Through career coaching, mentoring and learning opportunities, we also support and grow the digital and technical skills and capabilities of our people, all of which are critical in creating meaningful value for our clients today and well into the future. And to support employees’ mental health and well-being, we expanded various employee resources and programs, including increased benefits as well as, more broadly, encouraged our people to recharge when needed.
RBC’s culture and values help unlock the full potential of our employees. In doing so, we support and sustain a diverse and inclusive workplace, which is an essential ingredient in driving innovation and growth at RBC. Last year, we met with – and learned from – more than 500 students from underrepresented groups on how to better engage and hire them. And we continued to expand our diverse leadership team, reflective of the communities we serve. In 2021, I’m pleased that 43% of all executive appointments were members of BIPOC communities – well over our goal of 30% – and almost double from the previous year.
“ RBC is contributing to a more inclusive, sustainable and prosperous future.”

2021 ESG PERFORMANCE REPORT 7. 
Placing our planet on a more sustainable path Our ambition is to play a leadership role in accelerating the transition to a net-zero world. To do so, our efforts are embedded in our enterprise strategy, and are overseen by the bank’s climate steering committee, comprising senior executives from across our businesses. That ensures our ideas and initiatives permeate across the bank, and are regularly addressed around my leadership table and with the Board.
In 2021, we committed to achieving net-zero emissions in our lending by 2050, with supporting net-zero goals disclosed in our most recent Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) report. We also joined the NZBA, which builds on our ongoing efforts to work collaboratively with stakeholders from around the world to reduce emissions, and support an orderly and just transition to our net-zero future.
Last year we also announced our intent to allocate $500 billion in sustainable financing by 2025, making RBC the largest financier of the net-zero transition in Canada. This announcement is part of our larger efforts to support the net-zero plans of clients.
The power of our Purpose No single organization or sector has the resources to solve the complex challenges, or seize the boundless opportunities, in the coming years.
But RBC believes it can create a future where our employees are fully equipped, encouraged and engaged to be their best in a new world of work, and where our clients’ unique and evolving needs are met through our bionic blend of people and technologies. We are also helping to create a future where the full potential of people and their communities can be realized, and where a healthier environment and cleaner economy provides us all with greater opportunities to thrive and prosper.
The power of our Purpose will help us get there together.
Creating meaningful value for our clients Last year, as the uncertainty of the global pandemic led to elevated client activity, we were well-positioned to remain ever-present in their lives, enabled by our bionic blend of people and technologies. During the first 12 months of the pandemic, for instance, video consultations with RBC advisors grew to 44%. At the same time, we found new ways to create value for our clients. RBC Vantage, for instance, provides retail banking clients with more ways to save and earn RBC Rewards points and other personalized benefits. And our corporate clients gained a greater understanding of how ESG is shaping markets at RBC Capital Markets’ annual Global ESG Conference.
And we continued to reimagine the client experience through innovations that, in many cases, go beyond traditional banking. Commercial clients gained direct access to RBC Insight Edge, which helps uncover market trends, explore new locations and markets, and make other data-driven business planning decisions. We offered free trials of this platform to 110,000 small business clients struggling at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Championing inclusive growth in our communities Our society cannot move forward if people and communities are at risk of falling behind. Last year we drew public attention to the challenges many Indigenous youth face when they find themselves on the wrong side of the digital divide. During our research and consultations, one obstacle we continuously heard about was too many Indigenous youth aren’t prepared for the rapidly evolving workforce, often because they lack relevant training.
To help address such challenges, RBC Future Launch, our 10-year, $500 million commitment to prepare youth for the jobs of tomorrow, doubled the amount of money Indigenous scholarship recipients could receive, now $10,000 per year for up to four years. RBC also introduced a scholarship of equal value for Black youth.
Additionally, RBC launched a new financing solution that provides loans of up to $250,000 for Black entrepreneurs in Canada as part of our five-year, $100 million commitment to directly address the challenge many Black entrepreneurs face in accessing the capital and resources that are critical to their success.

Our approach to ESG. 
RBC’s ability to manage ESG matters is fundamental to our long-term success. It enables us to deliver on our Purpose to help clients thrive and communities prosper, and create meaningful value for our diverse stakeholder groups, which include our clients, employees, communities and shareholders. We employ a disciplined approach to defining our strategy, priorities and signature programs. It starts with understanding the key drivers of economic prosperity and the forces of change that present opportunity and challenge to those we serve. We then focus on where we have the social licence and opportunity to contribute in meaningful ways, and partner with others to work on important solutions. We also use “more than money” levers to multiply the impact of our work, including thought leadership, the power to connect and convene, the expertise and generous spirit of employees, and the bank’s own assets as an enterprise, including our leading brand and scale. And finally, we measure the impact of our ESG priorities and signature programs by tracking outcomes and then using this data to inform our programming decisions and strategy development. By taking these steps, we create meaningful value for our stakeholders.

Good governance is fundamental to our business, and it underpins everything that we do.

Governance. 
The COVID-19 pandemic and other events have shone a spotlight on systemic racism in our society, and the uncovering of unmarked graves at former residential schools served as a stark reminder of the challenges faced by Indigenous peoples and communities in Canada. We are committed to being a leader in diversity and inclusion, within our own operations, with suppliers and in the communities we serve. Additionally, our approach to community investment focuses on significant societal issues, including youth and creating more inclusive opportunities for communities to thrive.

Our ESG priorities. 
As a global bank, it is important that we identify, understand and respond to the ESG factors that matter most to our stakeholders and our business. As the COVID-19 pandemic continued to impact the way we worked and lived in 2021, we challenged ourselves to ensure we were focused on what was important to us, and reflected on our priorities and the implications of our personal and collective actions. We asked big questions about what was important to us, our stakeholders and society at large. As an organization, it required us to focus on and prioritize what mattered most.
Furthermore, identifying ESG priorities aligns with our enterprise risk appetite, which is to ensure we identify and manage the top and emerging risks, as disclosed in our 2021 Annual Report, and incorporate them into our existing risk management assessment, measurement, monitoring and escalation processes. This requires management to conduct a forward-looking assessment of risks to the organization.
How we identify our ESG priorities. 
Each year we conduct a review of our stated ESG priorities with a focus on areas of increasing importance to external stakeholders and to RBC. In 2020, we commissioned Deloitte, an independent provider, to facilitate a forward-looking assessment to identify the ESG issues of greatest importance to our stakeholders, employees and business objectives. Through the use of digital and artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled capabilities, in addition to human-centred research and engagement, we gained a unique perspective and insights that helped us better understand how stakeholder expectations have shifted during these challenging times.
In 2021, we refreshed our ESG priority matrix by re-examining the ranking of our ESG topics and identified new topics that were a focus for RBC and of interest to our external stakeholders this year. Updates were made based on our interactions with stakeholders and our ongoing monitoring of priority ESG reporting frameworks, ESG rating agencies, industry trends and independent research. The results of this analysis informed our list of ESG priorities, where we believe we can have the most significant positive impact on our stakeholders, communities and business. By focusing our efforts where we have the greatest influence, we strive to set an example while creating meaningful value for our stakeholders. All topics noted in the matrix are important to RBC, and we continuously monitor their evolving importance with external stakeholders.
Continuously improving our ESG reporting. 
Our approach is to continuously improve, with a focus on 1) disclosing the most relevant performance metrics and 2) embracing the principles and guidance of prevailing ESG reporting standards, including those associated with the SASB (see Appendix I on page 80 for more information), GRI, IIRC, TCFD, as well as local and national regulations in the regions where we operate. We invite our stakeholders to provide feedback on our disclosure by sending an email to corporatecitizenship@rbc.com. For more information on how we engage with our stakeholders throughout the year, please see Appendix II on page 87.

2021 ESG PERFORMANCE REPORT 17. 
We believe good governance is not just about overseeing RBC and its practices, but doing so in a way that’s transparent, independent of management and ethical. It involves the Board actively engaging with all stakeholders, knowing the business and its risks, challenging management where necessary, understanding the risks and opportunities of a changing industry and economy, setting robust standards and principles that will guide RBC to success and helping clients thrive and communities prosper – all to ensure we’re constantly enhancing value for our shareholders.
The strengths of our corporate governance start at the top and are fostered throughout the organization by a proactive governance culture that has consistently adopted industry-leading standards.
We are committed to high standards of governance that are consistent with regulatory expectations and evolving best practices and aligned with our strategy and risk appetite.
Our approach to corporate governance.

We are committed to the ongoing pursuit of strong and effective governance practices. The Board works closely with management to improve how we operate by making sure our governance approach incorporates evolving industry trends, regulatory expectations and global best practices. Our approach to responsible governance is based on the core principles highlighted in our Corporate Governance Framework.
The Board supports diversity and inclusion at all levels, in tandem with RBC’s diversity and inclusion strategy. We strive to ensure our director recruitment and succession planning efforts include a wide variety of expertise, perspectives and backgrounds, and take into consideration other important factors such as gender and non-gender diversity, ethnicity, race, ancestral origin, age, geography, background, sexual orientation and other dimensions of diversity. In particular, the Board considers the level of representation of women, BIPOC and other diverse groups when considering candidates to nominate. Ensuring directors have access to an extensive program of educational opportunities on emerging issues is also a key governance priority for the Board.

Our Vision is to be among the world’s most trusted and successful financial institutions. As a financial services company, we have an obligation to serve our clients with integrity and safeguard the trust they put in us. We define conduct as the manifestation of culture through the behaviours, judgments, decisions and actions of the organization and its employees. Our organizational direction establishes the expectation of fair conduct outcomes as the operating norm for the organization, including all employees and third-party service providers operating on behalf of RBC. Our Values and our Code of Conduct guide our behaviour and decision making when we serve our clients and when we interact with investors, our fellow employees and our communities. All employees and contract workers must successfully complete compliance training, and commit to and acknowledge the Code of Conduct annually.
How we achieve our results is as important as the results we achieve. This mindset is embedded in our culture, mandates and compensation programs. We produce regular and holistic reporting and dashboards for the Board on conduct and reputation risks, including updates from business segments and trend analyses.
We have risk behaviour expectations in place to promote our risk-aware culture of “Doing What’s Right”. These are articulated in our:  Values  Code of Conduct  Risk management principles, including the Enterprise Risk Management Framework  Risk-appetite limits and statements  Regulatory conduct rules, practices and policies  Performance management processes  Enterprise Culture and Conduct Risks Framework.

Promoting positive culture and conduct. 
We strive to maintain open, healthy workplaces where speaking up and diversity of thought are central to our ability to attract and retain the talent we need to deliver value to our clients, communities and investors.
The RBC Leadership Model, which sets out key behaviours expected of our workforce, encourages speaking up for the good of RBC, and our Code of Conduct requires all employees to report misconduct. Employees are encouraged to speak to their manager, senior management, Human Resources or Compliance so their issues are resolved quickly and objectively.
Our global Conduct Hotline is a confidential channel for all employees and contract workers to report misconduct. Employees and contract workers can use the hotline to report and track the status of their report anonymously. RBC received 294 hotline reports in fiscal 2021.34. 
RBC is committed to ensuring employees experience a fair and transparent process when having their concerns heard and addressed in accordance with our Values. Investigations are conducted as appropriate by trained professionals in Human Resources, Compliance, the Law Group, Privacy/Information Security, Internal Audit and Corporate Investigation Services, or by independent, external investigators. In addition to addressing misconduct, we proactively take note of any learnings from the investigations and make recommendations, as appropriate, to enhance our workplace.
RBC is committed to protecting employees from retaliation when they raise concerns. We actively monitor for retaliation including by following up with employees after an investigation is closed and annually reviewing key indicators such as performance ratings, compensation and employment status. All people managers are accountable for protecting employees who raise concerns from retaliation, and any retaliation is treated as a breach of our Code of Conduct.

Tax. 
Our Audit Committee oversees our financial reporting including our tax reporting. We discuss our tax strategy with the Audit Committee annually and provide updates on our tax position on a regular basis.
Our approach to taxation is grounded in principles that are reflected in our Code of Conduct, is governed by our Enterprise Tax Risk Management Policy and incorporates the fundamentals of our risk drivers. Oversight of our tax policy and the management of tax risk is the responsibility of the Group Executive, the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and the Senior Vice President, Taxation.
With operations in 29 countries, we are subject to Canadian and international tax legislation and other regulations, and our activities are fully disclosed to the relevant tax authorities. 84% of our revenue is earned in Canada and the United States, and we provide tax information for this geography in our published financial statements. In addition, we provide tax information annually on a country-by-country basis to the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA).
Taxation and Group Risk Management (GRM) regularly review the activities of RBC and its subsidiaries to ensure we are compliant with tax and other regulations.
We commit to:  Acting with integrity and in a straightforward, open and honest manner in all tax matters  Ensuring our tax strategy aligns with our business strategy, supporting only bona fide transactions with a business purpose and economic substance  Ensuring full compliance and full disclosure to tax authorities of our statutory obligations  Ensuring all inter-company transactions are conducted in accordance with applicable transfer pricing requirements  Endeavouring to work with tax authorities to build positive long-term relationships and, where disputes occur, address them constructively.

Employees are required to report possible instances of tax avoidance by following the Suspicious Activity Reporting procedures. Our independent internal Conduct Hotline was created in 2019 for reporting these and other issues.
– Our suppliers and service providers: Since 2018, the Supplier Code of Conduct has explicitly communicated our expectation of suppliers’ tax compliance.
– Our clients: There is a statement on our tax risk approach in our Annual Report as well in our UK Tax Strategy Statement.

Risk management. 
As a financial services company, we are in the business of managing risks as we aim to create maximum value for our shareholders, clients, employees and communities. The ability to manage risk is one of our core competencies, and is supported by our risk-aware culture and risk management approach.
Environmental and social (E&S) risk is the potential for an E&S issue associated with us, a client, a transaction, a product, a supplier or an activity to have a negative impact on our financial position, operations, legal and regulatory compliance, or reputation. E&S issues include, but are not limited to, site contamination, waste management, land and resource use, biodiversity, water quality and availability, climate change, environmental regulation, human rights (including, but not limited to, Indigenous Peoples’ rights) and community engagement. GRM is responsible for developing and maintaining policies to identify, assess, monitor and report on E&S risk, and to regularly review and update E&S risk policies. These policies seek to identify sectors, clients and business activities that may expose us to E&S risk. They establish requirements to manage, mitigate and monitor E&S risk, including when to apply enhanced due diligence and escalation procedures. Business segments and functional areas are responsible for incorporating E&S risk management requirements in their operations, and our E&S Risk team reviews and provides advice in respect of higher risk E&S transactions, providing both account managers and clients with expert advice, at the same time as mitigating RBC’s E&S risk.

Human rights. 
At RBC, we recognize that respecting human rights is a shared responsibility of all enterprises regardless of where they operate globally. It aligns with our Purpose, Vision and Values and has long been reflected in our policies and practices. Our Values and Code of Conduct guide us and set expectations for our behaviour and decision making, and our Supplier Code of Conduct also sets expectations around human rights, labour and employment standards for our suppliers and subcontractors.
Our Human Rights Position Statement, which is adopted at the highest levels of our organization, sets out our commitment to respect internationally recognized human rights in line with the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, and to strive to avoid causing or contributing to adverse human rights impacts through our own business activities and being directly linked to adverse impacts through our business relationships.
As part of our commitment, we will give particular attention to the rights of vulnerable groups who bear a disproportionate risk of adverse human rights impacts. These include, at minimum, women; national, ethnic, linguistic and religious minorities; children; persons with disabilities; LGBTQ+ people; and migrant workers and their families.
RBC’s enterprise-wide Human Rights Working Group, made up of senior representatives from key business units and functions, oversees our human rights governance efforts, including assessing our salient human rights risks, reviewing our policies and due diligence processes and developing ways to measure the effectiveness of our approach to human rights. Our Sustainability and Enterprise ESG team manages these efforts and advances our human rights strategy on a day-to-day basis.
 In line with the expectations of the UN Guiding Principles, we began our enterprise-wide human rights salience assessment to better understand how our business activities could potentially impact the human rights of our stakeholders. In 2021, we reviewed our salient human rights risks across a number of our functions and business segments.
 In 2021, we established a Monitoring and Reporting sub-group of our broader Human Rights Working Group with the mandate to set objectives and key performance indicators to measure our success in operationalizing the commitments in our Human Rights Position Statement, and continuously improve our approach to human rights.
 This past year, we created an enhanced human rights due diligence framework for our supplier risk management assessments. Under this framework, suppliers flagged for human rights risk are subject to an enhanced review of their human rights risk profile and how their policies and practices align with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. RBC will aim to prevent and mitigate adverse impacts to which we may be directly linked to by taking appropriate action to mitigate such risks, which may include the exercise of leverage in our business relationships.

In an increasingly competitive talent market, it’s important for RBC and our culture to stand out in meaningful ways to current and future employees. This begins with the recruiting and hiring process, and in 2021 we leveraged technology to improve the experience for both hiring managers and candidates. With virtual workplaces creating more options for candidates than ever before, our recruitment programs and campaigns showcased our unique culture and the compelling career opportunities at RBC to attract a diverse talent pool that reflects the communities we serve.
Leaders play a critical role in inspiring and retaining our talented employees around the world. With a focus on enhancing key leadership skills, RBC enabled people managers through targeted learning pathways, new peer-to-peer networks and renewed employee listening initiatives. A robust people manager community will be especially important as we continue to design and navigate both virtual and hybrid workplaces.
To recognize extra efforts throughout the pandemic and support mental well-being during challenging times, RBC provided every employee with a subscription to Headspace, a mindfulness and meditation app, and an additional day off to focus on wellness. We enhanced our support in other ways, including an increase from $3,000 to $5,000 in psychology benefits in Canada and a new program, Together, we’re perfectly human, which provided additional resources and helped to reduce stigma through executives and employees sharing personal stories of their mental health journeys.

Enhancing our virtual recruitment approach. 
Equipping our recruitment team with tactics and technologies to find and place candidates quickly has never been more important. By participating in a wide range of virtual events to engage both new and experienced professionals, RBC continued to ensure a broad reach and effective approach to attracting the right talent.
Attracting and retaining talent 2021 Highlights  Showcasing our talent: Videos and digital content featured employees and their unique experiences to reinforce RBC as a place where your imagination makes an impact. The campaign showcased our revamped Life at RBC – Our Stories webpage, encouraging potential talent to explore what it’s like to work at RBC.
 Recruitment partners: We continued to develop strong partnerships with a number of external organizations to recruit employees. Some of our recruitment partners include the Canadian Council on Rehabilitation and Work (CCRW), Big City Bright Future Programme, SEO London, The Bennett Edge, Specialisterne, Spinal Cord Injury Ontario, Canadian Mental Health Association, Uncovering Prospects, Inside Out, Jopwell, National Black MBA Association and People of Color Platform – Twin Cities, UNCF, Ready, Association of African American Financial Advisors (AAAA) and Mossier. We also partner with over 20 accessibility offices on campuses to promote RBC’s commitment to hire persons with visible and invisible disabilities.
Attracting diverse talent through listening, engagement and choice. 
A diverse and inclusive workforce fosters innovation and new ideas. Through our Diversity Works Here® event series, RBC deployed unconscious bias education to more than 1,000 hiring managers to help them conduct better interviews. We expanded our outreach efforts by hosting listening sessions with over 500 students representing LGBTQ+, BIPOC communities, newcomers, and persons with disabilities to understand barriers and opportunities to better engage and hire. We leveraged the Career Edge Internship Program to provide opportunities for persons with disabilities, newcomers and new graduates. Career Edge has a strong success rate, with 55% of participants converting to full-time employment in the past 12 months.
A variety of community outreach programs help diverse new talent discover RBC, and provide us the opportunity to build a more inclusive workforce.

Attracting and retaining talent 2021 Highlights. 
Digital talent. 
As a digitally enabled relationship bank, RBC hires future skills – such as data, design, app development and product ownership – to create seamless client experiences. Throughout the pandemic it has become even more important to attract and retain people with these skills. With a focus on meaningful connections, career coaching, mentoring, learning and growth opportunities, RBC delivers exceptional experiences to our digital talent. In addition to completing a market analysis to ensure we offer competitive compensation, we expanded our existing Tech Hubs and announced plans to welcome 300 tech employees over the next three years to our new Calgary Innovation Hub. Our efforts resulted in over 600 digital talent hires across RBC in 2021, with a 95% offer acceptance rate.
 RBC Virtually Together: Expanding on the success of 2020, we virtually onboarded more than 1,500 summer students to roles across our global businesses and functions. Highlights included the RBC Onboarding Café (powered by Ten Thousand Coffees), where students could network with peers and leaders (87% adoption by students); Diversity & Inclusion sessions including a “Belonging at RBC” event with presentations by six enterprise employee resource groups; a virtual swag bag with a one-year LinkedIn Learning License and a subscription to Headspace; and a partnership with Olympian Sarah Wells on the Believe Impact Program, where students built community impact projects. Out of the 300 participants, 91% said the program made their internship more meaningful, and 97% felt it enabled their ability to connect with students across RBC.
 Campus recruitment: Aiming to attract early talent across RBC through rotational, co-op and post-graduate opportunities, we welcomed students in all years and programs from more than 90 post-secondary institutions globally. In 2021, 50% of all summer student opportunities were awarded to BIPOC youth and 46% to women, surpassing our student diversity goals of 40% of summer interns identifying as BIPOC.39  RBC Career Launch® Program: Since 2014, this one-year paid internship has bridged the school to work transition for more than 700 recent college and university graduates. In 2021, our second virtual cohort (53% women, 53% visible minorities) joined RBC from 18 communities across Canada – supporting our clients through operations centres, bringing their valuable skills to charitable community partners and partnering with our head office teams.
 Indigenous Peoples Development Program (IPDP): In 2017, we launched the IPDP to recruit recent graduates who self-identify as Indigenous (First Nations, Inuit or Métis) Peoples of Canada. The two-year experiential learning program helps them develop the skills and network they need to build their professional experience, with the opportunity to gain exposure to different aspects of finance, auditing, risk management, technology, marketing, capital markets or human resources. To date, we have hired 40 Associates for this program, and in 2022, we intend to hire an additional 22 Associates. In 2020, 50% of participants were promoted and 68% in 2021. This year, IPDP Associates gave back to the local Indigenous communities by working with nine charitable organizations and contributed a total of 5,740 hours to meaningful projects.

2021 ESG PERFORMANCE REPORT 30. 
Attracting and retaining talent 2021 Highlights  Leadership Development Program (LDP): This is a rotational program that builds a pipeline of talent for future leadership opportunities, with a focus on one of five streams: Finance, Internal Audit, Group Risk Management, Enterprise and Personal & Commercial Banking (P&CB). The two-year program consists of four six-month rotations, where employees collaborate with leaders on complex assignments, developing skills and learning through mentorship and formal training. The current cohort comprises 53% women and 71% BIPOC.
 The Ignite Leadership Development program: A 10-12 month leadership program for nominated high-potential BIPOC talent aimed at accelerating their trajectory to senior management. The program helps address common challenges, provides opportunities to develop and practice key leadership behaviours and enables cross-bank networking with peers and senior leaders. It also includes formal coaching by an external executive coach and the opportunity to leverage skills and gain experience by partnering with a charity to solve their biggest business challenges. In 2021, Ignite participants helped four prominent charities solve relevant and timely business challenges, donating over 945 hours over an intensive two weeks. To date, 92 diverse leaders have completed this program and 29% of participants have been promoted.
 Diverse talent sponsorship: RBC’s talent review process includes focusing on the development and sponsorship of potential leaders who are women and BIPOC candidates. A reference guide provides leaders with an understanding of the purpose and differences between coaching, mentoring and sponsorship, and how each applies to the development and advancement of top talent.
 Women in Leadership: A global, 10-12 month leadership program offered to nominated, high-potential, senior non-executive women. This program helps women enhance their leadership capabilities, build strategic influence and increase networks and exposure to senior leadership. Since its inception in 2013, 221 women have completed the program and 29% have been promoted.
 Simplify and focus the role: We used storytelling to better connect RBC’s Leadership Model to the manager role, providing clarity to elevate people management across RBC. Digital resources (e.g., Dear People Manager video and podcast series) were leveraged and integrated into relevant people strategies and initiatives.
 Build capability: We modernized our people manager curriculum to develop key skills managers need to thrive, and provided flexible options to meet current needs and an effortless path to learning. Based on feedback, the program scored 98% for content relevance, 98% for readiness to apply new skills and 95% for likelihood to recommend.
 Enable the role: We expanded the categories asked in our annual Employee Engagement Survey (EES) to better understand manager effectiveness, engagement and enablement, and we identified opportunities to ask managers for feedback on key topics. For example, a crowd sourcing tool gathered input on how managers want to learn, connect and grow from one another, resulting in more than 200 managers participating and contributing over 260 ideas that will inform our future people manager community. Collectively, expanding how we listen to our managers has allowed us to better measure their effectiveness and respond to their needs.
Inspiring human-centric leadership. 
Recognizing the critical role of leaders to inspire and retain our talent, RBC rolled out our renewed People Manager Strategy. A key focus was on developing human-centric and future-focused capabilities (e.g., empathy, problem solving, building trust, hybrid team dynamics) to strengthen our caring culture and provide the guidance and reassurance teams need in the changing world of work. We built and released solutions aligned with three strategic pillars:
Developing talent. 
We strive to accelerate and advance the skills, capabilities and internal networks of our leaders through a variety of programs, including:

Creating experiences that enable our people. 
To keep pace with the changing world of work, and meet both the needs and expectations of our workforce, we delivered enriching experiences to enable our people who, in turn, drive positive impact for our clients, communities and each other.
The need to stay connected across a virtual workplace has reinforced the importance of deepening human-centric skills. At RBC, we see adaptability, resiliency, problem solving and imagination as critical to helping us navigate the road ahead. That’s why we are creating a future of work where employees receive training, support and a breadth of diverse work experiences that encourage them to be curious, try new things and improve how we do things.

2021 ESG PERFORMANCE REPORT 32. 
Creating experiences that enable our people. 
Always-on employee listening. 
To better understand the diverse needs, preferences and workstyles of our global businesses and employees, RBC continues to use a variety of listening initiatives such as Pulse Surveys, an annual engagement survey, diversity and inclusion listening sessions, targeted interviews and focus groups.
In April 2021, we launched a new Employee Engagement Survey (EES), a major milestone on our journey to reimagine how we listen and bring feedback to life across RBC. The survey was designed to create a better survey experience for employees, including fewer questions with more open-ended options to gain a better understanding of sentiment. At the same time, an improved dashboard was developed to provide people managers with greater insight into their teams’ results, with access to real-time data and AI assisted insights.
Overall, employees remain highly engaged and feel proud to be a part of RBC. Answering “Strongly Agree” and “Agree”, employee engagement shows:  94% feel they contribute to RBC’s success  91% are proud to be a part of RBC  90% are willing to go above and beyond. 
Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic, employees continued to feel well-supported by RBC. With work-life balance at the forefront, many crave some form of flexibility day to day and see the benefits of both in-person and remote working environments.
Providing an effortless path to learning. 
In a world where change is the only constant, we are transforming the way we enable continuous learning experiences and accessible development programs. To support professional growth while keeping our workforce safe, we accelerated virtual offerings and micro-learning resources on topics that were top of mind for employees.
 Inclusion and belonging: To strengthen our culture of inclusion, new virtual programming and mandatory anti-racism training built awareness and engagement to ensure RBC is a place where people feel they belong and can be their authentic selves.
 Speaking openly about mental health: We introduced new resources to help identify the signs of mental health concerns, strategies for prioritizing well-being and techniques to help us confidently address individual needs. This included a new e-learning module, virtual instructor-led training, conversation guides, a video learning series, job aids and supporting resources.
 Hybrid work: From fully on premises to fully remote or anywhere in between, today’s world of work requires more intentional effort to build relationships, clarify expectations and adapt to new habits and routines. This year, we introduced webinars and learning resources to help employees and people managers adapt to hybrid workplaces, re-establish team norms and stay engaged, productive and connected.
 Change management: Managing through uncertainty and ambiguity requires thoughtful planning to consider the impacted stakeholders, implications for the change and ways to mitigate and manage risks. This year, we introduced a new virtual workshop on planning for successful change to help employees apply an agile change methodology.

Creating experiences that enable our people. 
LIFT Performance Enablement. 
Our “always on” approach to elevating performance and unlocking potential includes a focus on building habits to set ambitious goals, having regular check-ins, giving and receiving feedback, recognizing contributions that exemplify our Leadership Model behaviours and having ongoing conversations about development opportunities. Our LIFT Roadmap provides a year-at-a-glance view of strategies to integrate LIFT Habits, and over 25,000 employees subscribe to the monthly Grow & Develop newsletter, which provides micro-learnings on the latest in-demand skills and capabilities.
Building skills needed for today and tomorrow. 
As the world of work continues to change – due to economic factors, technological innovation and post-pandemic conditions – so does the need to evolve our skills. We endeavour to help employees learn as fast as the world is changing by building relevant skills and resilience to respond and adapt.
 Top skills: We published a list of the most common skills required for work across RBC to help guide employees’ development plans. We leveraged initial data from a new job architecture framework along with insights from RBC’s Humans Wanted report and our HR team. Each skill was matched with relevant learning opportunities in a variety of formats to support continuous growth.
 Leap reskilling: Combining self-directed and social learning in a book-club-like learning environment, Leap offers a way to develop skills while connecting our employees across departments and geographies. Throughout 2021, this program more than doubled with over 2,400 employees developing critical skills for the future to increase their career mobility.
 Technical skills assessment: We introduced a new platform that supports our talent acquisition team and hiring managers to ensure new hires in critical tech talent roles have the required skills for current jobs, and are able to adapt and acquire new skills in the years ahead.
 Adaptive Micro-Learning: With 24,000 users, this learning platform is focused on the development of high-performing employees and delivering measurable business results by leveraging the latest in learning methods – for example, micro-learning bursts, AI and data analytics – to deliver a personalized upskilling experience.
 Capital Markets Emerging Talent Program: This first-ever developmental experience delivered across multiple teams in Capital Markets enhanced 32 technical and essential skills in a conference-style program including real case studies, hands-on experience and group programs.

Creating experiences that enable our people. 
Enabling our future of work. 
The pandemic has challenged assumptions about how and where work is done across our global workforce. With an objective to hold onto the best of everything we’ve learned and recapture what we’ve missed from our pre-pandemic world, teams are establishing work arrangements to match their needs and strategies. While we know that a virtual workplace is possible for many roles, we also realize there are undeniable benefits to being in person for the moments that matter. That’s why we established enterprise guiding principles to inform planning and ensure a consistent employee experience.
 Flexible work is here to stay: Hybrid work arrangements will be supported where feasible and optimal for the business, clients and employees.
 Our approach starts with our business strategy: Platforms have the flexibility to adopt a tailored approach for specific teams, roles and regions, while enterprise standards set the parameters for consistency and scale.
 Proximity still matters: Being close to our employees and the communities we serve is core to our culture and will remain so in the future; for the majority, this means residing within a commutable distance to the office.
 Strategic investment is required: To fully enable our employees, we will invest in technology, infrastructure and skill development to operate in a more flexible environment.
 Inclusive culture with growth opportunities: Employees should have a consistent and meaningful employee experience with access to development opportunities regardless of their work arrangement or location.

Creating experiences that enable our people. 
Knowing that the key to our hybrid future is staying flexible, we created the Future of Work Portal, which is regularly updated to provide the resources employees need, based on their everyday experience and work arrangement. Customized content includes:  For people managers: Conversation guides and playbooks to encourage new ways of working and support their teams’ current and future work experience  For onsite employees: Technology support and collaboration tools, welcome kits with the latest health and safety information and guidelines for their RBC location  For fully remote or hybrid employees: Playbooks, learning opportunities and virtual collaboration tools to establish new habits and routines. 
Return to premises. 
Throughout the pandemic, the health and well-being of our employees has been a top priority and the starting point for all of our decisions. We’ve taken a risk-based approach to returning to premises that considers external factors such as new COVID-19 variants, infection trends, local vaccination rates and government restrictions, as well as business needs and internal protocols. While we’ve successfully welcomed many employees back to RBC premises in some jurisdictions, joining those who stayed on site in client-facing and other critical roles, our approach is flexible to adapt to changing conditions.
As a result of our efforts, RBC was recently recognized by the International WELL Building Institute (IWBI), earning the WELL Health-Safety Rating for 11 Toronto and Greater Toronto Area locations. We’ve continued to evolve our health and safety measures and now require all RBC employees, who are able, to be fully vaccinated to work on our premises in the regions where we are permitted to do so.
We’ve continued to take steps to ensure our workplaces support the health and well-being of our employees and clients, such as our daily health prescreener, physical distancing measures, mask requirements and Plexiglas barriers in branches. As we’ve done throughout this time, we expect to evolve our approach as we move forward.

Strengthening a diverse and inclusive culture. 
Our strong culture is a reflection of our Vision, Values and the diverse group of people around the world who bring RBC’s Purpose to life every day. We believe a relentless focus on diversity and inclusion is essential to attract, retain and enable the best talent. During 2021, we made measurable progress on our diversity and inclusion commitments and continued to respond to important issues across our communities. Entering the second year of a global pandemic and responding to an uncertain landscape on many fronts, we continued to listen to the needs and views of employees to understand how to create a sense of belonging and inclusion across our virtual workplace.
As a change leader, we are delivering on the commitments we set last year as part of our Actions Against Systemic Racism. In 2021, we launched the Black Entrepreneur Startup Program (BESP) in collaboration with Futurpreneur Canada, invested $1 million in Black Innovation Capital (BIC) and US$5 million in L’Attitude Ventures, which invests in early-stage Latino-led businesses, and launched the RBC Black Entrepreneur Business Loan (BEBL). We have also made significant progress in advancing leaders from the BIPOC community across RBC. In particular, BIPOC executive appointments represented 43% of all appointments in 2021, up from 23% in 2020, and surpassing our goal of 30% for the year.
We received recognition as one of two Catalyst award winners globally in 2021, reflecting our ongoing focus on advancing women in leadership. In 2021, women represented 41% of all executive appointments and 54% of all promotions globally. In 2021, RBC placed second out of 100 global companies according to the Refinitiv Diversity & Inclusion Index rating, with an overall score of 81%.43 We are inspired by the talented people behind these numbers and the leaders across RBC who demonstrate their commitment to strengthen an even more inclusive future for their employees, clients and communities.

Building employee awareness of diversity and inclusion. 
Following up on the more direct conversations around social justice, equity, inclusion and belonging that were accelerated in 2020, RBC committed to enhancing our existing unconscious bias training and introducing the new mandatory RBC Anti-Racism Awareness Training Program for all those who work at RBC. With a 94% completion rate, this module has given employees the opportunity to deepen awareness, gain perspective and develop greater empathy around issues of race, bias and racism.
In 2020, we launched an innovative online course called 4 Seasons of Reconciliation, which has helped employees better understand Indigenous Peoples, Canada’s history with Indigenous communities and the importance of truth and reconciliation. We are proud to have extended this course to Canadians more broadly in 2021.50. 
We continued to engage employees in our ongoing video campaign and related learning materials, encouraging employees and the public to continue to speak up for inclusion. “That Little Voice” was the second in a series of videos, and combined with “Speak Up for Inclusion”, has reached more than one million views since its inception.
We also introduced a new way of measuring inclusive experiences and established baseline measures in our annual Employee Engagement Survey to actively manage employee sentiment across three pillars of inclusion: psychological safety, belonging and respect/trust.
Diversity in leadership. 
The only way we can truly represent the communities we serve and harness the potential of our people is to grow the diversity of leaders across our bank. We remain committed to expanding our leadership bench and pipeline, with a particular focus on women, BIPOC, persons with disabilities and LGBTQ+ individuals. Our talent management, leadership development and succession planning strategies are designed to develop a team of leaders who reflect diverse thought, voices and abilities, and are able to drive our business strategies and performance forward in a purpose-driven way.
At a time when women and the BIPOC community are disproportionately impacted by the pandemic, we are building on our momentum to remove barriers to equity, at all levels and career stages. To retain and advance untapped talent, we have ongoing training and development programs for underrepresented groups, and we involve and encourage leaders to build and strengthen diverse teams by embedding diversity and inclusion goals into people leaders’ performance expectations.
Knowing that investing in early talent enables future success, over 50% of all summer opportunities went to BIPOC youth in 2021, exceeding our goal of 40%, and with a specific focus on recruiting from Black and Indigenous communities, to bring broader perspectives to our teams and create career opportunities for a more diverse group of students.39. 
We continue to develop strong partnerships with external organizations and campuses to recruit employees from diverse backgrounds, which in turn will ensure our pipeline draws from a broader talent pool.

Increased transparency to support pay equity. 
RBC is committed to the principles of pay equity for all employees, regardless of their gender or race/ethnicity. We take action to address pay disparities, when identified, across groups of employees performing equal or comparable work. We conduct regular gender- and race-based compensation analyses as part of our compensation review processes and review pay differences, taking into consideration factors such as position level and tenure, specialized skills, business or function, and geography, all of which may contribute to differences in pay.
We measure and manage gender equity and racial equity in pay using a custom business analytics tool, which helps us identify potential differences in pay across groups of employees, adjusting for known variables that impact pay, including observable personal and occupational characteristics such as platform and position level.
In addition, we complete gender equity and racial equity in pay analyses and filings annually, where required, to comply with the Canadian federal Employment Equity Act, provincial and federal Pay Equity legislation, and the UK Gender Pay Gap reporting regulation.
Since there are a number of variables that are considered in establishing pay levels, we periodically carry out statistical analyses to eliminate factors that may explain variations in pay, including levels of proficiency and performance, education, accreditation, and role accountabilities. As a result of these efforts, we have built new tools, repeatable procedures and training activities to increase manager awareness and avoid potential biases that could affect performance evaluations and compensation.
The past two years have reaffirmed that diversity and inclusion is indeed a journey, and we need to be ready to adapt and respond to challenges along the way. We remain committed to continuing to evolve our practices and programs to drive increased equity and strengthen our inclusive culture.

It also became clear that the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated and reshaped our world and our future in permanent ways – transforming the way we live, work, shop and connect with each other. These changes represent tectonic shifts that won’t revert back to the way things were.
At RBC, we have a strong vision for the future. We know that to remain successful requires us to operate in two worlds – our traditional businesses and the pivot to a far more digital world. Doing so takes more innovation, integration and breaking down business silos of what we do so we can redefine and deepen relationships and create more value for our clients.
We are uniquely positioned to create long-term value for our clients through the power of our ideas, investments in talent and technology, and differentiated advice, products and services.

In 2021, we continued our journey to create differentiated experiences and deliver meaningful value for our clients.
This year it was especially important we deliver on our Purpose, to help our clients thrive and communities prosper, as the COVID-19 pandemic continued to impact many of our clients and their communities. With our brand, we led by example, and acted on behalf of those we serve to provide relief, insights, stability and solutions, in the most difficult of times.

On June 17, 2021, RBC Insight Edge became available for direct access through a subscription to commercial clients and small to medium retail business clients. Helping owners make more data-driven decisions about their business, customers and markets, RBC Insight Edge is part of RBC’s overall pursuit to help Canadian businesses scale and manage their operations through enhanced digital capabilities and insights that go beyond traditional banking. RBC offered Insight Edge free trials to 110,000 small business clients struggling as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
 Wealth Management Canada (WM Canada) hosted over 3,000 high net worth clients of RBC Dominion Securities® and RBC PH&N Investment Counsel® at virtual events on topics related to physical and financial well-being. The events featured expert speakers from Women’s Brain Health Initiative, National Institute on Ageing, YWCA, RBC Economics as well as PH&N Investment Counsel’s Chief Investment Strategist.
 In 2021, RBC’s Creditor Insurance team improved our ability to help clients make informed decisions by enhancing our What If Protection Tool for advisors. This tool enables a consistent and client-focused insurance conversation using three easy steps to understand the impact that a loss of income could have on their finances. In addition, the Creditor Insurance team made it easier for clients to access information online, enabling faster, more confident protection decisions digitally. This year the RBC Mobile Banking and Online Banking channels enhanced clients’ ability to add LoanProtector® insurance (creditor), including Life, Life + Disability, and Life + Critical Illness protection.
Deepening client relationships through collaboration and strategic partnerships  RBC established a new partnership with GrantMatch, a software-enabled services firm that specializes in securing government grants and incentives for diverse North American businesses across many sectors. RBC business clients can now access the GrantMatch Funding Assessment & Strategy Tool to search for funding opportunities as well as to connect with experts in government incentive programs.
 In July 2021, P&CB in partnership with RBC Capital Markets® launched the RBC ESG Market-Linked GIC, which allows investors to support a global portfolio of companies that focus on things they care about. To be included in the index, all companies must pass a set of rigorous ESG standards; in addition, investors get protection of their original investment and the confidence that comes from investing with RBC.
 RBC InvestEase® is a low-cost, low-effort, smart online investing service, with access to human support that allows clients to start investing with as little as $100. In addition to our standard portfolios, we offer responsible investing portfolios, which are built with a focus on companies that score highest on a wide range of ESG factors, including carbon emissions, labour management, product safety and quality, and business ethics. These portfolios are ideal for clients wanting to make a positive impact on the world without necessarily sacrificing returns.
 In response to feedback from clients that family caregiving and elder care was one of their top concerns, WM Canada launched a new partnership with Elder Caring Inc. and its principal, Audrey Miller. Through educational articles, events and one-on-one consultations, Audrey introduces strategies to help clients and their families care for loved ones as they age.

 To provide best-in-class services to RBC GAM relationship management teams, distribution partners and clients, we’ve developed various innovative tools. MyInvestment Portfolio (MyIP), which RBC GAM launched in partnership with P&CB, is one of these tools. MyIP is a fully integrated client discovery, portfolio construction and management platform integrated into RBC P&CB’s MyAdvisor® platform.
 The health and wellness of Canadians and being there for our clients continues to be a strong focus for RBC Insurance®. In addition to creating new health and wellness partnerships in 2021, we made many of our existing solutions available virtually. In February, RBC Insurance launched its Mental Wellness Campaign, supported by a series of short videos, to encourage Canadians to do a small act of mental health hygiene and awareness every day. RBC Insurance’s Find a Psychologist service was launched in partnership with Strata Health and the Ontario Psychology Association, enabling Ontarians (and their family members) to quickly find professional support based on their needs. Also in 2021, a new partnership with Maple Virtual Care offered RBC Insurance Group Benefit Solutions members direct online access to doctors for a consultation, often within minutes, by video, instant message or phone call – no appointment necessary.
Accelerating our focus on innovation and digital strategies  P&CB launched RBC Vantage™, Canada’s newest everyday banking offering. RBC Vantage brings together a comprehensive collection of powerful benefits that RBC clients can enjoy every day with any personal bank account, with no minimum balance requirements. RBC Vantage delivers a client experience that provides more value: clients can now earn RBC Rewards® points on debit purchases and have more ways to save on monthly account fees. New interactive tools strengthen our clients’ confidence in making critical financial decisions with personalized advice tailored to their unique needs.
 In 2021, WM Canada continued to focus on enhancements to improve our online experience based on direct feedback from clients and advisors. In addition to delivering over 150 fixes and enhancements, the all-new WM mobile experience in the RBC Mobile app was launched and now serves RBC PH&N Investment Counsel, RBC Royal Trust and RBC Dominion Securities clients. Currently, 50% of our clients have gone paperless and receive their documents electronically through RBC WM Online. Through our partnership with Tree Canada, WM Canada planted over 26,000 trees – one for each client household that went paperless. In 2021, this initiative saved over 3,500 trees, 18,000 kg of waste, 2.4 million litres of water and 479,000 kg of CO2.
 RBC GAM has continued to accelerate the development of new digital capabilities across our distribution channels to enhance the experience of advisors and clients. In 2021, we launched a series of new features on the integrated MyIP/MyAdvisor enterprise platform. These features extend the trade fulfilment and auto-rebalancing capabilities to all branch retail investment accounts, enable advisors to create non-model multi-fund portfolios to meet customized client needs and introduce new capabilities in the RBC Mobile app.
 RBC Insurance has made it easier for our clients to do business with us through a number of digital enhancements, including our Online Insurance portal, which enables clients to have full view of their insurance policies and coverages, and access a number of self-serve features. We also launched a “Go paperless” campaign on Earth Day to increase enrolment in Online Insurance, electronic statements and policies, and reduce paper consumption by 10% in our home and auto business, saving over 850,000 sheets of paper in 2021.

Our digital and innovation strategies are fundamental to creating exceptional client experiences, driving customer loyalty and acquiring new clients. They also help us mitigate some of the risks associated with digital disruption as we work to differentiate our business and drive value for clients. We are committed to designing and building products, processes, technology and services in faster, simpler and more cost-effective ways.
We are proud to champion Canadian innovation, particularly the transformational technologies of machine learning and AI. In 2016, we established the research institute Borealis AI™ to pursue curiosity-driven, applied and fundamental research in machine learning and are distinguishing ourselves as one of the leading voices on AI in Canada. We are not only driving our own innovation, but also leading the way in the responsible and ethical use of AI. For example, Borealis AI developed RESPECT AI™, an online hub that brings open source research code, tutorials, academic research and lectures to the AI community, helping bring ethical AI to all.
Our digital strategy has four objectives:  Reimagine everyday banking experiences to differentiate ourselves and delight our clients with simplicity and connection to advice  Be the leading Canadian app in the financial services market, revolutionizing the mobile customer experience through personalization and valuable customer interactions  Be the most trusted global bank through joint leadership in digital ID verification, authentication and security  Become the North American leader in digital client acquisition and sales. 
Our focus on digital innovation is to make daily banking easy, helpful and convenient for our clients. For example, with Mobile Bill Pay, we paired AI with Optical Character Recognition to simplify how clients pay bills. We continue to focus on developing digital banking products that give clients better insight into their finances, enable them to personalize their digital experience and empower them to access financial advice when and where they want.

Personalized experiences and insights. 
Personalized experiences: Our goal is to deliver world-class experiences that are highly personalized to the individual. At a macro level, we are creating unique experiences in the RBC Mobile app for specific segments, like students, entrepreneurs and self-directed investors. At a micro level, we are tailoring advice and insights to the individual through the NOMI® suite of capabilities.
Personalized insights: We are using data-driven insights to help personal and business clients stay on top of their finances. NOMI Insights® helps clients manage their everyday finances by providing timely and personalized alerts, reminders and tailored insights based on spending and saving habits. This year, more than 775 million insights54 were read by clients using NOMI Insights.
AI-driven digital money management tools. 
Budgets and savings: NOMI Find & Save® uses predictive technology to help clients save, even when they think they may not be able to. To date, clients using this feature have saved on average more than $420 per month.55 Also, NOMI Budgets helps clients by taking the thinking – and the manual calculator work – out of setting up a budget. It takes a close look at a client’s spending and recommends a personalized monthly budget based on their habits. Since its launch in April 2019, clients have set more than 2.2 million budgets using NOMI Budgets to help better control their spending.
Cashflow forecasting: NOMI Forecast provides clients with a quick seven-day forecast of their future cashflow and, paired with other NOMI capabilities, offers a more holistic view of their account activity. It removes the stress of tracking when bills need to be paid, the amount due and how it impacts future cashflow by showing clients their upcoming preauthorized payments from any deposit account. NOMI Forecast is also the first time Borealis’ AI technology has been integrated into a retail banking offering, setting the stage for RBC to deliver next generation cashflow forecasting and insights in the palms of clients’ hands.
Connecting from anywhere. 
Remote account opening: Clients can open deposit accounts from wherever it’s most convenient for them – either on their own or with an advisor on the phone. RBC Direct Investing Inc. has also launched an end-to-end digital account opening process for new-to-RBC clients, who can now easily be approved for a new account online in just a few clicks.
Advice when you need it: MyAdvisor provides RBC clients with digital access to their personalized plan and connects them to an RBC advisor in their community on live video, by phone or in person at a branch. It has been especially useful during the pandemic since clients can connect with an advisor safely and remotely from the comfort of their own home. The use of the live video option to meet with advisors has soared to 44% from 3% from March 2020 to March 2021. We have now onboarded 2.8 million Canadians on the platform with a personalized plan, helping them stay more closely connected to their finances.
Trust and security 2-Step Verification (2SV): By validating our clients’ identities in our mobile app through multi-factor authentication, we can better protect our clients against fraud and notify them when they’re at risk. Since the client manages the verification process in the RBC Mobile app, there is no need to manually enter a security code sent to them by email or text. With the press of a single button, they can seamlessly continue with their banking needs knowing their information and accounts are protected. Since no security code is used, there is no threat of it being intercepted.
Remote ID Verification (IDV): Clients can digitally verify their identities both remotely and in the branch. The RBC Mobile app uses AI to check a client’s government-issued identification against the security features and characteristics of their driver’s licence or passport. By validating our clients’ identities in our mobile app, and against government standards, we can better detect and prevent fraud.

We have a clear approach to how we think about our clients’ personal information. Transparency is key. People need to know how their personal information is being used and shared. And organizations must help people exercise control over which personal information is used and shared.
We continue to invest heavily in cutting-edge information security technology to protect our customers and our business every day.
RBC is managing privacy risk prudently in the face of the heightened risk due to the COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing regulatory change. We have enhanced our privacy risk assessment technology to enable us to meet current and future challenges as we look for more ways to drive value through data and move towards assessing risk across end-to-end business processes.
The RBC Global Privacy Office is part of the Regulatory Compliance group. The Chief Privacy Officer provides the strategic vision for global privacy risk management, and designated Compliance/Privacy Officers are responsible for privacy advice, oversight and challenge across every business. Our privacy risk management program is based on the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development privacy principles, which include cyber security as part of the Security Safeguards principle, as well as Canadian, U.S. and European Union privacy regulations. (Our approach to cyber security is discussed on page 47.)
Our Privacy and Security webpage and our Global Privacy Notice articulate how we collect, use, share and protect information. When we engage thirdparty service providers to process personal information on our behalf, (1) we share only the information necessary to perform the services; (2) we require them to protect the information in accordance with RBC’s standards; and (3) we require them to notify us of any actual or suspected privacy breaches so we can work together to contain, remediate and, where required, report them. All employees and contract workers are required to complete a Fundamentals of Privacy and Security course annually or biannually, depending on business requirements, which is supplemented with monthly enterprise-wide privacy awareness communications.
RBC did not experience any major privacy breaches in 2021. We manage actual and potential privacy incidents and complaints through well-established processes. Our policy requires privacy incidents to be tracked centrally and reviewed by Compliance/Privacy Officers.56.

Globally, the volume and sophistication of cyber attacks continue to evolve and increase; the resulting implications could include business interruptions, service disruptions, financial loss, theft of intellectual property and confidential information, litigation, enhanced regulatory attention and penalties, and reputational damage. We continue to enhance our security capabilities, educate our customers and workforce, and deepen our relationships with governments, law enforcement and academia to ensure our cyber defenses remain effective in thwarting the threats targeting the financial sector.
We have a dedicated team of technology and cyber security professionals that manage a comprehensive program to help protect the organization against breaches and other incidents by ensuring appropriate security and operational controls are in place. We continue to strengthen our cyber control framework and improve our resilience and cyber security capabilities, including 24-hour monitoring and alerting of potentially suspicious security events and incidents. In 2021 we continued to make investments in the program and conducted multiple scenarios and simulations to test our resiliency strategy.
Cyber security 2021 Highlights  Digital risk profile: We are managing the risks of the continued evolving digital threat landscape resulting from workforce adoption of hybrid workplace arrangements and client adoption of digital services through layered security solutions including multi-factor authentication and behaviour analytics.
 Maturing our capabilities: We are ensuring our cyber policies, standards and controls keep pace with the threat landscape and regulatory environment, and we continue to harness emerging technologies such as AI and machine learning to combat cyber crime and strengthen our end-to-end view of risks and controls across the enterprise. We continue to upskill our staff to ensure we keep pace with the changing cyber risk profile.
 Third-party relationships: As the convergence of third-party and cyber risk continues, RBC is evolving the way we assess supply chain risks and the level of exposure arising from third-party relationships, and we are enhancing our resilience through continued improvements in our operational risk programs.
 Strategic partnerships: The Cybersecure Catalyst program at Ryerson University enables RBC to provide thought leadership and innovation in cyber security. We continue to expand intelligence partnerships with law enforcement and defense agencies in Canada and internationally.

Responsible investing 2021 Highlights. 
RBC GAM. 
Fully integrated ESG All of our investment teams integrate material ESG factors into their investment processes. We believe the integration of material ESG factors may enhance the long- term performance of our portfolios. We view the integration of ESG as a competitive advantage in our investment process and continue to advance our work in this area.
 In 2021, we continued to focus on enhancing ESG knowledge firm-wide. ESG education sessions were held featuring both internal and external experts. We discussed a range of topics in these sessions, including climate change, human rights and executive compensation best practices. Education sessions were held both firm-wide and for our internal ESG Champion network. This year, we also enhanced the avenue in which new developments in responsible investment are disseminated across the firm by producing an internal RBC GAM ESG newsletter.
 All investment teams assess material climate-related risks and opportunities in their investment processes. To assist in integrating climate risks and opportunities into the investment process, climate scenario analysis dashboards are produced on a quarterly basis in approximately 100 core portfolios. These dashboards provide detailed analysis of climate-related metrics and factors that may be used in investment decision making.
Active stewardship The goal of our engagement program is to effectively communicate our views of material ESG issues as an investor. It also allows us to better understand how our investee companies approach ESG issues.
 In 2021, our investment teams held 1,651 engagements with issuers directly and an additional 38 engagements collaboratively with other investors.58  We continue to collaborate with our partners on issues specific to our investments and other market-wide considerations. New collaborative initiatives include becoming a signatory to the Responsible Investment Association (RIA) Canadian Investor Statement on Climate Change as well as being a founding member of Climate Engagement Canada.
Proxy voting is a key part of our engagement process as it provides an important way for us to convey RBC GAM’s views to boards and management. Below is a summary of our voting statistics59, 60 for 2021:

Responsible investing 2021 Highlights. 
RBC USWM. 
Interest in responsible investing continued to grow at RBC USWM in 2021; efforts were focused on the continued expansion of information and investment solutions available to clients. There were three key focus areas in 2021:  Thought leadership and education: USWM produced several publications and newsletters to aid advisors and clients in educating themselves in and understanding responsible investing. Understanding the different forms of responsible investing and how to apply them to a portfolio is at the core of any conversation. In 2021, we launched a client questionnaire designed to help clients better articulate what responsible investing means to them.
 Managed solutions: In 2019, USWM launched the RBC ESG Select Portfolios. This suite of portfolios followed USWM global asset allocation guidelines and was constructed using mutual funds and exchange traded funds (ETFs). In 2021, USWM refined and expanded its suite of responsible investing solutions.
 ESG consideration in Portfolio Advisory Group (PAG) equity portfolios: The PAG team performs research on and constructs equity portfolios. In early 2021, the PAG team considered ESG risks when making investments using an ESG-aware approach. In 2021, PAG hired a responsible investing and ESG portfolio manager to launch more dedicated ESG solutions in the coming year.
RBC WM Canada. 
WM Canada continued to make a concerted effort to expand responsible investing practices. In 2021, WM Canada worked to drive adoption by advisors and clients through thought leadership and adding additional investment vehicles to the platform. Beyond that, WM Canada is following a similar strategy to the one laid out for USWM.

Our approach to sustainable finance integrates ESG insights and traditional financial analysis and market perspectives. We believe sustainable finance represents a growth opportunity for our business and our clients. In April 2019, RBC announced a commitment to provide $100 billion in sustainable finance by 2025, and after just two years we surpassed that goal. In 2021, we increased our commitment to provide $500 billion in sustainable finance by 2025.
This commitment supports companies and projects that are widely recognized as contributing to a net-zero, inclusive economy of the future. Achieving this goal and supporting our clients in the transition to a net-zero economy are key pillars of our enterprise climate change strategy, the RBC Climate Blueprint. To learn more about our approach and the services we provide, please visit our Sustainable Finance website.
We look forward to continuing to help our clients achieve their sustainability goals by delivering advice and solutions that also aim to create positive outcomes for clients, communities and our planet. We remain committed to working with industry, government, financial institutions, civil society and academia to promote consistent tracking and measurement of sustainable finance activities, and to evolve our methodology as needed to reflect global best practices.

For RBC, generating and distributing economic value is about how we fulfil our obligations to the economy and promote the well-being of society at large. It is a simple equation: we generate revenue from the products and services we sell; we then distribute a portion of that revenue – or economic value – to those we rely on for our success. That distribution is seen in the compensation and benefits we provide our employees, in the dividends paid to our shareholders, in meeting our tax obligations at all levels of government and in the investments we make in our communities.
In 2021, we earned revenue of $49.7 billion and distributed $35.1 billion in economic value. We invested the balance in our company for future growth. For more information on our operating expenses, cash dividends and tax expense, consult our 2021 Annual Report. For more information on our community investment activities, see page 59.
According to the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), “economic value generated and distributed”26 is defined as measuring the impact of a company on the economy. We are committed to showcasing our substantial role in generating and distributing economic value throughout the areas where we operate.

RBC is committed to a fair sourcing process that offers equal opportunities to third-party suppliers in Canada and around the world, including those who identify and are certified as diverse suppliers. We work with our suppliers to promote and uphold high sustainability standards in our supply chain by applying enhanced environmental and social screening criteria. We have a principles-based Supplier Code of Conduct that articulates RBC’s expectations with respect to a supplier’s business integrity, responsible business practices and responsible treatment of individuals and the environment.

Responsible procurement and supplier management. 
In 2021, RBC paused its use of the CDP supply chain survey due to cross-industry changes in operations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. RBC also began work to better understand climate commitments that key suppliers have made, and is exploring opportunities to directly engage with suppliers in important categories of enterprise spend. This work will continue in 2022 and is focused on identifying climate-related risks and opportunities throughout the supply chain, including measurement of GHG emissions in key areas.
How we do business is as important as what we do, and RBC remains committed to working with its suppliers to minimize and reduce their environmental impact. Our Procurement team uses a standard set of Request for Proposal (RFP) questions that assess factors important to RBC including diversity & inclusion and environmental impact. Responses to these questions are assigned mandatory weights and form part of RBC’s overall supplier evaluation process.
We are committed to ensuring that our procurement strategy and RFP process reflect RBC’s Purpose, Vision and Values, and that our suppliers meet the expectations of both RBC and our clients to act as good corporate citizens.

Responsible procurement and supplier diversity 2021 Highlights. 
Procurement and supplier diversity. 
The RBC Global Procurement team is committed to an inclusive supply chain as demonstrated through its numerous initiatives and sponsorships. In 2021, RBC continued to strengthen the supplier diversity program in Canada, the U.S. and the UK, promoting inclusive supply chain opportunities to Indigenous-, women-, BIPOC-, LGBTQ+-, persons with disabilities- and veteran-owned businesses. In support of certified diverse suppliers,78 and addressing the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the program helps guide diverse business owners to various pandemic relief fund support from the financial services industry by hosting joint webinar sessions with Canadian Supplier Diversity Councils. In addition, RBC offered actionable insights, ideas and strategies for diverse suppliers through the Chatter That Matters podcast series to help small businesses deal with and recover from the challenges created by the pandemic.
RBC’s Global Procurement team has set an aspirational goal of including a diverse supplier in the majority of competitive sourcing events and has mandated specific supplier diversity questions as part of the formal competitive sourcing assessment methodology.

We recognize we have an important role to play in addressing societal challenges. Accordingly, we have refined our community investment approach, which focuses on significant societal issues, and we have developed a targeted, comprehensive and coordinated strategy to address these issues by leveraging RBC resources and capabilities.
We are proud to invest significantly in the communities where we work and live – our long-term success depends on it. As one of Canada’s largest corporate funders of charitable organizations, we provided $106 million in cash donations and $36 million in community investments globally in 2021, including total contributions exceeding $13 million since the onset of the pandemic to mitigate the human and economic impacts of COVID-19. A significant portion of the cash donation contribution includes over $70 million from the RBC Foundation®, a separate legal entity that reports financial information to the CRA.
As signatories to Imagine Canada’s Caring Company Program, we invest a minimum of 1% of our domestic net income before income taxes in support of charitable and non-profit initiatives in Canada.
Our corporate citizenship strategy is an outward expression of our Purpose, and puts communities at the centre of what we do. It is key to helping clients thrive and communities prosper. We support our communities in many ways, including:  Donations to registered charities as gifts  Support to non-profits and organizations providing significant community benefit  Community sponsorships that align with our brand and business goals and deliver social, environmental or economic benefits  Volunteer efforts of employees and retirees, with financial support from RBC to their charitable partners  Other community investment activities including gifts in-kind and employee activities in support of community development during working hours  Financial products and services that generate social and environmental benefits as well as financial returns. 
Disaster and humanitarian relief. 
Throughout 2021, urgent action was required to respond to tragic humanitarian and environmental crises. RBC and RBC Foundation mobilized to support community partners in these significant times of need, including:  In response to the discoveries of thousands of unmarked graves at former Residential School sites, a $250,000 donation to the Indian Residential School Survivor Society to expand their 24-hour helpline and onboard Traditional Healers  In response to the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan, a commitment of $200,000 split equally between the Afghan Women’s Organization and Windmill Microlending to support the over 20,000 refugees arriving in Canada. 
Additional support was directed through regional Red Cross branches for relief efforts in response to wildfires and floods in Western Canada, Hurricane Elsa in Barbados, the magnitude 7.2 earthquake in Haiti and Hurricane Ida in the Southern United States.

Community and social impact. 
Impact Measurement Framework. 
In 2018, we developed the Impact Measurement Framework (IMF) to help guide our investment decision making and ensure our overall impact on society is managed appropriately. The RBC IMF measures impact by quantifying potential benefits across six pillars – social, environment, economic, employee, business and brand – as one holistic view of the value we add through all of our initiatives and investments across the enterprise, at any level of aggregation. We consulted the UN SDGs when we developed our IMF impact areas. Aligning them with the SDGs makes it easier for us to quantify our contributions to global goals. See Appendix III on page 89 for more on our impact areas and the associated SDGs. For more information on how we drive positive community and social impact across these priority areas as well as our employee community involvement, please visit the RBC Community and Social Impact website.

Community and social impact. 
RBC Future Launch. 
The COVID-19 pandemic has compounded the challenges facing young people as they prepare for a dramatically changing workforce, but it has also strengthened our resolve to help them chart their path. In 2021, we intensified our focus on delivering greater utility to Canadian youth in response to the social equity gap that emerged in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Whether it was access to employment, job-ready networks or mental health services, RBC Future Launch, our 10-year, $500-million commitment to support young people, increased reach and impact where it mattered most.
The COVID-19 pandemic has also accelerated the evolution of our community relationships into transformational partnerships that support youth in very practical and meaningful ways. Scaling our partnerships from 130 to over 500 has provided the base from which we can adapt relationships, programs and utility to fit the current and emerging needs of young people. As a result of our efforts, we’ve reached 3.6 million youth since 2017, and over 880,000 of them have reported feeling better prepared for the future of work. The program also continues to unlock partner capabilities to deliver economic impact, such as enabling economic growth for entrepreneurs, supporting small businesses to hire youth employees, providing access to training in cloud computing and digitizing over 40 programs to be accessible globally.
We deploy a more-than-money approach to our investments by building the capacity of our partners, strengthening their capabilities and helping them achieve their respective missions. To drive systemic change, our objectives include using our capabilities for good, forging targeted multi-sector partnerships and stimulating public thinking. We are dedicating our knowledge, skills and resources in partnership with organizations that are helping young people access meaningful employment through practical work experiences, skill-development opportunities, networking solutions and mental health services. By investing $265 million since 2017 in cash community investments and other support through 550+ partnerships, we have increased the number of youth reached through high-impact programs. In 2020, we committed to providing $50 million in focused funding through RBC Future Launch, to create meaningful and transformative pathways to prosperity for up to 25,000 BIPOC youth by 2025, with investments in areas such as skills development and mentoring. In 2021, we contributed nearly $17 million towards our goal. We have also created tools, programs and partnerships to leverage RBC’s scale, influence and assets, thus multiplying the impact of our substantial financial commitment. In 2021, over 400,000 youth accessed tools such as RBC Upskill, Future Launch at Home, Magnet, Riipen and Prepped.
This approach drives awareness across multiple sectors (educators, government, business and community organizations) and allows us to take a holistic approach to preparing youth for the future of work, including our own employees. We are intentional in our collaborations, including with partners, employees across RBC and most importantly young Canadians, to ensure what we build is relevant and applicable.

RBC Tech for Nature. 
RBC Tech for NatureTM is our multi-year commitment to accelerate tech-based sustainability solutions. Using a more-than-money approach, RBC is bringing together charitable partners, technology experts, the public and the private sectors, as well as our own unique capabilities, to build the type of multi-partner coalitions needed to work towards solving our shared environmental challenges. For more information on RBC Tech for Nature, please see page 72 in the Value for Planet chapter.
Diversity and inclusion. 
At RBC, we believe that diversity and inclusion provide an advantage in developing intellectual capital and ensuring our company’s continued growth in Canada and around the world. By drawing on the strength of diversity, we can meet new challenges and help create prosperity for our communities. As a result, the theme of diversity underscores our community programs. Across our entire community investment portfolio, we proactively look for opportunities to support Indigenous Peoples, the LGBTQ+ community, women, newcomers, persons with disabilities, racialized communities and individuals of low- socioeconomic status. For more information on how we supported Canadian communities through our programs highlighted above, please see pages 3-8 of our 2021 Public Accountability Statement.
RBC Emerging Artists Project. 
The RBC Emerging Artists Project seeks to advance artists’ career trajectories in visual arts, music, theatre, performance, literature and film. In 2021, we supported over 250 organizations with nearly $10 million to create exposure, networking and training opportunities to help over 6,300 emerging artists establish and grow their careers.
With the closure of venues, galleries and performance spaces, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the arts community. In 2021, we were particularly dedicated to maintaining the intention and integrity of the RBC Emerging Artists Project and worked closely with our partners to support programs with innovative and digital solutions that create exposure and performance opportunities for emerging artists. We also increased investments in Indigenous programs to enable the creative economy by helping artists transition from emerging to emerged. Students, educators and emerging artists are gaining a clearer understanding of opportunities in the arts sector, resulting in thriving and successful careers across all genres.
Engaging employees as agents of social change. 
RBC employees around the world have continued to find unique and safe ways to support their communities in the face of uncertainty. In 2021, employees and retirees volunteered over 109,000 hours in their local communities. With the uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic still affecting charities around the world, we committed to increasing our skills based volunteering programming to benefit both employees and their communities. This was part of ensuring that both employees and community members had a chance to work together toward solutions for long-term change. The 12-week Social Impact Learning program and four-day Ignite Hackathon moved to a virtual format to bring together over 275 global RBC employees to provide nearly $4 million in pro-bono services and work to develop and implement an actionable solution to a challenge identified by RBC’s community partners. Both programs focused on BIPOC communities and RBC future leaders in tandem with RBC’s diversity and inclusion strategy.
Together, our employees and retirees raised over $23 million for more than 5,000 charities across Canada during our annual Employee Giving Campaign. For the first time the campaign was completely virtual, increasing the number of employees who participated. The goal of the campaign is to make it easy for employees to support the charities of their choice through volunteering their time, making personal donations and creating virtual team events to support their community.
With the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on live events, RBC employees, charities and communities came together virtually for the second year to participate in the global RBC Race for the Kids™ event. In Canada, there were over 17,000 participants, including over 8,000 RBC employees, family and friends, raising more than $4.5 million to support our Canadian charitable partners, with a focus on youth.

Helping people feel empowered with the knowledge, skills and confidence they need to make smart, everyday financial decisions and work toward reaching their goals is important to RBC. The compounding effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have eroded the financial resilience of many individuals, materially impacting their financial well-being.
The increased prevalence of these stressors has placed a heightened importance on financial inclusion and literacy for RBC, our clients, and communities. In Canada, our efforts are geared to low-income individuals, seniors, persons with disabilities, youth and young adults, Indigenous Peoples and newcomers. We offer a suite of 25+ solutions around financial literacy and inclusion, either directly through RBC or through partners, that target different needs such as an AI-powered predictive and personalized money savings solution, money management apps, a customizable online finance tracker, and personal finance education. Since 2019, we have offered free online personal finance education to individuals across Canada, in both official languages, in partnership with McGill University. We also provide financial literacy education through other partner organizations including BGC Canada, International Development and Relief Foundation (IDRF), Katimavik and TakingItGlobal. The Value for Clients section of this report has more information on our solutions including NOMI Find & Save, RBC Vantage and MyAdvisor. Also, a detailed list of solutions can be found in the About Value for Communities background paper.

2021 ESG PERFORMANCE REPORT 64  Financial Literacy for Indigenous Peoples course: In October 2021, RBC launched a course aimed at providing Indigenous Peoples with access to resources and information on managing personal finances. Created in partnership with the First Nations Child & Family Caring Society, the course provides practical advice and guidance on managing money with confidence and planning for the future. It was created in response to a recommendation by First Nations youth who gathered in 2019 to discuss the need for changes to child welfare and provide thoughts on the compensation for First Nations children, youth and their families that was ordered by the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal earlier that year. The course is divided into five modules covering key topics such as basics about money and banking, budgeting, managing debt and credit, and saving and investing. Each module is accessible in written PDF form and also includes online multimedia material, such as short introduction videos featuring RBC’s Indigenous employee resource group, the Royal Eagles. The entire course can be viewed in approximately two hours and completed at their own pace.
 Financial literacy outreach initiatives: RBC continued its efforts to deliver financial literacy advice to youth in 2021 through virtual workshops. Through its Future Launch Champions network of over 130 talented professionals across the bank, RBC delivered 94 workshops on financial literacy, reaching over 2,100 youth. Of those, 40 workshops were conducted in partnership with BGC Canada, focused on teaching the basics of banking and the power and risks of credit, with the goal of providing participants with increased confidence in handling their money through effective budgeting.
 Mydoh: We are committed to helping youth build better banking behaviours through Mydoh, the financial literacy app that is backed by Smart Cash Card. Since its launch in 2020, Mydoh has launched a first-of-its-kind innovation in Canada – a secure, numberless, physical Smart Cash Card for kids (card details are only available in the app). Mydoh has also been named the North American winner of the 2021 Gartner Eye on Innovation Award for Financial Services.
 Arrive®: RBC continues to invest in a beyond-banking venture called Arrive, where the objective is to help newcomers achieve their life, career and financial goals in Canada. Arrive is a free digital platform for newcomers. Through the Arrive app and content hub, newcomers can access personalized tools, resources and learning modules. The Arrive content hub also provides newcomers with workshops and webinars to prepare for life in Canada, on topics such as searching for a job and accessing healthcare and housing. In 2021, on average, more than 87,000 newcomers a month accessed the Arrive platform, demonstrating a significant need for relevant information and support during these uncertain times.
 On Campus Advisor network: Students across Canada have greater access to advice, tools and resources through our RBC On Campus Advisor network, engaging students by delivering financial literacy content in a fun and interactive way. Across 20+ Canadian campuses, domestic and international students have access to free in-person and digital advice sessions to help them feel comfortable talking about money and better prepare for their school year and financial future. In 2021 over 69,700 students across the country participated in the RBC On Campus Mission: Tuition Virtual Scavenger Hunt, where they answered questions and learned about financial literacy topics that are hyper-relevant to students. After playing, 88.8% felt more prepared to discuss their finances.

Global plans to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions to achieve net-zero by 2050 require the largest change to our economies in our lifetime, and one that RBC is fully committed to supporting.
The RBC Climate Blueprint (Blueprint) is our enterprise climate change strategy to accelerate clean economic growth and support our clients in an inclusive transition to a net-zero economy. The Blueprint was updated in 2021 and now outlines four strategic priorities that are anchored by our strengths in finance, investment, risk management, innovation, economic and policy research, and community investments.
In 2021, we committed to aligning our lending activities to net zero emissions by 2050, which also aligns with the goals of the Paris Agreement. To support our net-zero ambition, we joined the NZBA, a global, industry-led initiative to accelerate and support efforts to address climate change. It is a time for action, which is why, along with our Blueprint and NZBA commitments, we also present details in this chapter on our net-zero lending plan and examples of how our strategy is creating impact today.
RBC supports the Financial Stability Board’s TCFD recommendations and is committed to producing annual disclosures that consider these recommendations. We include TCFD disclosures in our Annual Report, we produce a standalone TCFD report and we have a climate hub on rbc.com. We recommend readers review these additional disclosures that complement the content in this chapter.

Royal Bank of Canada Climate Blueprint. 
CEO Message. 
Tackling climate change presents a big challenge and an even greater opportunity, one that will impact all of our lives and those of generations to come. Global plans to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net-zero by 2050 require the largest change to our economies in our lifetime, and one that the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC®) is fully committed to supporting.
At RBC, we’re convinced of the merits of a sustainable, net-zero future, and the RBC Climate Blueprint is our plan for how we can get there. It is designed to guide us, working with our clients and communities, to contribute to a healthier planet and more prosperous and inclusive economy for the 21st century. Because we believe it’s the smart choice.
The financial system needs to be leading efforts to accelerate clean economic growth and the transition to the net-zero economy. Climate change is already a business reality for our clients, and many have embraced new ways of doing business and reframed climate action as an opportunity to improve and expand what they do.
We believe that capital can be a force for positive change, clearly demonstrated by our target of $500 billion in sustainable financing by 2025, the largest commitment in Canada. This goal supports investments in companies and projects that are widely recognized as contributing to the sustainable economy of the future.
This approach to sustainability is central to our business and to our stated Purpose, to help clients thrive and communities prosper. We know we can do this by taking the best of what we have today – our human resources and natural resources – to build a better tomorrow. The choice belongs to all of us.

2021 ESG PERFORMANCE REPORT 69. 
We are making investments in people, capabilities, data and analytics that will help us achieve our net-zero lending commitment. An important initial step is our first disclosures of our Scope 3 financed emissions. This baseline is a foundational dataset that helps us establish an enterprise climate risk appetite, set interim financed emission reduction targets and build out climate-related stress testing programs.
Financed emissions In 2021 RBC joined PCAF86 to align with a globally recognized GHG emissions accounting and reporting standard and advance our capabilities in measuring the emissions associated with our lending and investments (GHG Protocol, Scope 3, category 15, “financed” emissions). We have conducted an initial measurement of the emissions associated with our portfolio across all six PCAF asset classes. This first disclosure represents our clients’ Scope 1 and 2 emissions. For this exercise we have combined two of the six assets classes, business loans and project finance, as the calculation methodology is similar for both asset classes. Due to limitations in emissions data availability, this first disclosure for all six asset classes is overwhelmingly at PCAF data quality Score 5, which PCAF defines as uncertain (estimated data with very little support). Consequently, we are viewing our initial results as estimates of our total financed emissions. Our goal is to improve our data quality score over time, as both emissions data availability and our capabilities related to measuring our financed emissions improve.
Initial results. 
In total our initial estimates are that RBC’s portfolio of financed emissions account for approximately 45MtCO2e, with business loans and project finance collectively representing 83% of our total financed emissions.87 Business loans, project finance and mortgages combined make up 90% of RBC’s total financed emissions.
Our top three emitters: oil & gas, agriculture and utilities. 
Measuring our financed emissions has given us an initial look at the financed emissions, broken down by sector, within the business loans and project finance PCAF asset classes. This has helped us to prioritize specific areas of our portfolio as part of our net-zero strategy.

2021 ESG PERFORMANCE REPORT 70. 
Net-zero lending. 
Achieving net-zero emissions in our lending will require absolute GHG emissions reductions across a number of key sectors that are both high-emitting and critical to the Canadian economy. These sectors include, but are not limited to, oil & gas, utilities, agriculture, industrial products, transportation and mining & metals.
It is our ambition to capture a disproportionate share of the business opportunity presented as the economy works to decarbonize. We are encouraged to see that many of our clients in these key sectors are committing to reducing their GHG emissions, accelerating meaningful action and making multi-decade investments in cleaner production and products, and alternative energy sources. And we believe that clients who are strategic, have credible GHG emissions reduction plans and execute against those plans will be successful in the net-zero transition. The challenge is how to accelerate the transition with a focus on getting to net-zero with a sense of urgency while at the same time managing and planning complex change across geographies and economies.
The early actions we are taking related to our net-zero lending commitment focus on understanding and tracking our clients’ plans to reduce GHG emissions, plans that aggregate up to our targets with a view of net-zero by 2050. This includes consideration of client and sector-level emissions (absolute- and intensity-based), client GHG emissions reduction plans and progress in achieving these, being mindful of sectoral transition pathways. We will continue to work with clients to help them improve transparency and reporting and, where appropriate, make this a requirement of the financing relationship. We will continue to evaluate clients on several key factors through our Environmental and Social Risk Management process with client-by-client risk decisions. We disclose what we will and will not finance in our published Policy Guidelines for Sensitive Sectors and Activities.
As the next step in our journey towards net-zero lending by 2050, we will work with our clients to support their climate-related disclosures and decarbonization plans. Having established an initial view of our financed emissions through the PCAF methodology, and in line with our NZBA commitments, we are initially prioritizing our efforts to focus on key high-emitting sectors within our portfolio. Focusing our actions will support us in delivering meaningful progress towards our climate goals and to improve data accuracy, given the constraints we currently face within businesses, sectors, and clients that are at varying levels of maturity with respect to data, technologies, disclosures and transition plans.
To this end, we have established the following specific goals for certain key high-emitting sectors,95 in accordance with our NZBA commitments:
We have chosen to focus on Capital Markets clients in high-emitting sectors within our oil & gas, power & utilities, and automotive & transportation portfolios at this time because they represent a significant portion of the emissions in our overall portfolio, and client-level emissions data and transition scenarios are more readily available. As we progress along our net-zero journey, we will expand our efforts to obtain this information from other sectors and clients as part of meeting our broader commitments under the NZBA.
Hold ourselves accountable  In 2022, we will update our primary enterprise-wide Environmental and Social Risk Policy to reflect our enhanced climate commitments and objectives as well as the strategic choices we are already making towards these goals.
 For Capital Markets clients in high-emitting sectors in our oil & gas, power & utilities, and automotive & transportation portfolios, we will endeavor to have by the end of fiscal 2025: - Clients representing 80% of available loan balances96 reporting their Scope 1 and 2 emissions to RBC.
- Clients representing 65% of available loan balances 96 disclosing a plan to reduce their GHG emissions to RBC.
 By the spring of 2023, or earlier if possible, we intend to disclose interim financed emission reduction targets for clients in high-emitting sectors in our oil & gas, power & utilities, and automotive & transportation portfolios. Subsequently within 12 months of disclosing such targets, we will disclose how we are advancing plans to achieve those targets.

RBC Tech for Nature. 
Innovative solutions, based on technologies like blockchain, AI, machine learning and digital platforms, offer immense potential to address complex environmental challenges. We are investing significantly in these technologies for enterprise purposes because we recognize their potential to offer game-changing solutions to climate change and environmental challenges. We also recognize that we need to partner with the best, brightest and boldest minds to accelerate and scale the deployment of these solutions. RBC’s goal is to bring the right partners together to tackle these global challenges. That’s why we launched RBC Tech for Nature – our commitment to innovation, data and technologies for our shared future. RBC Tech for Nature will provide up to $10 million in annual support to universities and charities that are developing technology solutions to address climate change.
2021 Highlights  Through RBC Tech for Nature, we provided over $10 million to more than 110 universities and charities that are solving pressing environmental challenges by leveraging technology and innovation capabilities. This brings our total investment to date to over $27 million since 2019.
 We are building an innovation ecosystem for early-stage ventures working on solutions to climate change and other complex environmental challenges. We supported innovative new programs such as The RBC Women in Cleantech Accelerator, a new program by MaRS Discovery District that supports 10 leading Canadian entrepreneurs in scaling their clean technology companies, with the potential for global impact, and Accelerate from Anywhere, a joint initiative of the Centre for Social Innovation and Foresight Canada that will provide an “acceleration ramp” for over 160 early-stage cleantech entrepreneurs from across the country.
 We have a multi-year partnership with DataStream, an open access platform for sharing water data, to help drive their expansion from just three regions to right across Canada. RBC Tech for Nature has played an integral role in DataStream’s growth by contributing to the design and development of the blockchain technology that is integrated with the platform. This technology enables DataStream to bring a new level of data security and transparency to water monitoring data in Canada.
 We supported Coastal Action, an environmental non-profit organization in Atlantic Canada, to pilot 3D Wave Design’s cutting-edge mapping technology and living shorelines that utilize vegetation and natural materials to help prepare citizens, governments and business owners in Lunenburg and nearby Mahone Bay for the effects of rising oceans and climate change.

Advance net-zero leadership in our own operations. 
Beyond our business segments, there are opportunities in our global operations to invest in green buildings, energy efficiency and renewable energy. Reducing GHG emissions and energy use is foundational to any corporate environmental program and an expectation of any organization that is taking action on climate change. This is why, in 2017, we became carbon neutral and committed to a goal of net-zero emissions in our global operations annually. We continue to accomplish this through energy and emissions reduction programs in our property network and IT infrastructure by procuring renewable energy through a power purchase agreement (PPA) and by sourcing renewable energy credits (RECs) and high quality carbon offsets to account for emissions we cannot eliminate. Each year, we aim to be less reliant on carbon offsets.
To this end, we set two key goals in 2020 that drive our net-zero operations strategy: reduce absolute GHG emissions by 70% with a baseline year of 2018 and increase our sourcing of electricity from renewable and non-emitting sources to 100%, both by 2025.
We had a 94% decrease in emissions from business travel, which contributed to an overall reduction of 55% in total GHG emissions in 2021 over our 2018 baseline (see below). Decreases in our absolute GHG emissions were driven by a combination of factors including lower occupancy rates in our office spaces and less business travel due to COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, our continued operational efficiency programming, our increased focus on and investment in renewable energy for our operations and the continued decarbonization of electrical grids globally.

 In 2021, we created the RBC Net-Zero Operations Working Group, focused on executing the operational goals outlined in the RBC Climate Blueprint and coordinating net-zero leadership initiatives across RBC. The Working Group has executive representation from Corporate Citizenship, Climate Strategy & Governance, Corporate Real Estate, Personal & Commercial Banking, Procurement, and Finance. The Working Group meets at least quarterly and is focused on accelerating our ambition on key emissions reduction opportunities, driving group consensus around leadership initiatives and informing the build-out of the net-zero operations strategy.
 RBC’s first long-term renewable energy PPA, which we entered into in 2020 with BluEarth Renewables, began commercial operation in May 2021. The PPA – a first for a Canadian financial institution – directly supported the construction of two solar farms in Alberta, which created more than 300 new construction jobs and provides Alberta’s electricity grid with roughly 80,000 MWh of renewable energy annually, enough to power more than 6,400 homes for a year. In addition to providing renewable energy for RBC’s operations, the project will contribute significant and stable long-term property tax revenue to the local economy over the life of the facility.
 In 2021, for the first time, 99% of our electricity consumption in Canada came from renewable and non-emitting sources. This increase is a result of the renewable energy we receive through our power purchase agreement and through renewable energy credits purchased from provinces with an emissions-intense grid.
 In 2021, RBC ran a three-week Global Earth Day Challenge, which prompted our employees to learn more about climate change, the company’s climate commitments and how they could take small actions to protect our planet. Over 10,500 RBC employees from 19 countries completed over 45,000 activities and unlocked more than $800,000 to support eligible charities of their choice.
 RBC has developed a multi-year strategy to complete LED lighting retrofits and implement smart building sensors across our retail branch network in Canada. To date, lighting retrofits have been rolled out in over 300 branches, and smart building sensor devices have been installed at over 550 branches across Canada. In 2021, RBC completed 60 LED retrofit projects and 25 smart building sensor projects to reduce energy consumption across the RBC portfolio, which will save enough electricity to power 1,500 homes for a year.
 In the Caribbean, we are proud to have approved our first renewable energy project: a solar rooftop installation at our offices in Nassau, Bahamas. The solar installation will generate 100 kilowatts of renewable energy to satisfy part of RBC’s energy needs in the country. The solar installation is expected to offset approximately 15% of the building’s energy usage on an annual basis and is anticipated to be completed by Q4 2022. This project will not only reduce our operational emissions, but also contribute to mitigating impacts of climate change through increased local resilience.
 Set to open in 2022, RBC Gateway is a brand new 37-storey office in downtown Minneapolis that will soon become RBC Wealth Management’s U.S. headquarters. The space aims to have an EnergyStar score of 89 out of 100, which is 39% better than the average building in the U.S. As the largest tenant in the LEED-certified space, RBC will absorb the building’s many attributes that go above and beyond energy-efficiency standards, such as daylight harvesting, which cuts down on energy consumption by using natural daylight to illuminate space, integration of smart building sensors to track desk usage and ensure optimization, and sub-level metering to monitor energy usage. All of these will help RBC fulfil its bold commitment to reduce our carbon footprint in our global operations.

Endnotes 1 See page 35 of our 2022 Management Proxy Circular. This information represents our Board composition as of February 8, 2022. Percentage of BIPOC directors is based on self-identification data, which have been collected since 2020. Data prior to this time are not available. 2 Throughout this Report you will see the term “BIPOC”, which stands for Black, Indigenous and People of Colour. This term recognizes the unique histories of racism Black and Indigenous people have lived through. While the term BIPOC originated in the United States, its meaning has significance worldwide. Similar acronyms are used in different regions; for example, BAME, which is commonly used in the UK, stands for Black, Asian and Minority Ethnicity. The term BIPOC is not intended to be a catch-all as RBC recognizes that not all people experience racism in the same way. 3 Average percentile ranking compiled from our four top-tier ESG ratings/rankings, including Sustainalytics, MSCI ESG Rating, FTSE4Good and S&P Global’s Corporate Sustainability Assessment (informing the DJSI). This metric was formerly called ESG Composite Index. 4 Data collected using RBC’s new Employee Engagement Survey (EES), with an average participation rate of 76%. 5 Global; excludes summer interns, students and co-ops. 6 North America; excludes summer interns, students and co-ops. 7 Assets managed by RBC Global Asset Management that are beneficially owned by clients, as of October 31 for each of the years presented. All RBC GAM investment teams integrate material ESG factors as part of the investment approach and follow RBC GAM’s approach to responsible investment. This figure includes investments in derivatives, cash, and money market instruments. Due to the nature of these instruments, ESG factors are less likely to impact the value of an investment compared to investments in asset classes like equities and fixed income. Where a material ESG risk or opportunity is identified, it is considered in the investment decision. This figure also includes funds that track an index. For funds where the investment manager does not exercise discretion, such as funds that track an index, there may be less opportunity to integrate ESG considerations as part of the investment process. This figure also includes externally subadvised assets under management. The level of ESG integration is assessed during the selection process of all new external subadvisors and the ESG integration approaches of existing external sub-advisors are monitored. However, these sub-advisors do not follow RBC GAM’s approach to responsible investment. For further definitions, please refer to rbcgam.com/cgri. 8 Includes contributions to non-profits or non-registered charities, employee volunteer grants, community sponsorships, community-benefiting program costs and gifts in-kind for the period of November 1, 2020 to October 31, 2021.

As signatories to Imagine Canada’s Caring Company Program, we invest a minimum of 1% of our net income before income taxes in Canada to support local charitable and non-profit endeavours. 9 For more information, please see https://www.sasb.org/. 10 RBC launched its first Environmental Blueprint in 2007. 11 RBC won the Catalyst Award for advancing women and other diverse groups for the first time in 2010. RBC is one of the few companies to win this award more than once. 12 See page 37 of our 2022 Management Proxy Circular. The Bank Act requires that the Chief Executive Officer be a member of the Board and, as Chief Executive Officer, David McKay is affiliated with RBC and is not independent. All other members of the Board are independent. Substantial majority is defined by the RBC Director Independence Policy. 13 Metrics, and goals where applicable, for women, the BIPOC community, persons with disabilities and Indigenous Peoples represent Employment Equity data as at October 31, for each year presented, for our businesses in Canada governed by the Employment Equity Act. Given variations in the legal definitions and restrictions in legislation around the world, comprehensive data on these four designated groups are available only in Canada. Based on employee self-identification. 14 Our multi-year goal is 50% women executives. 15 Our 2020 ESG Report included “Women in middle management and above” and “BIPOC in middle management and above”. Middle management and above includes executives whereas the metrics reported in this 2021 ESG Report segment out executives and senior management. For further details on representation by specific management tiers, please see the 2021 D&I Report. 16 In 2021, 24,065 employees moved into new roles across the enterprise. 17 Rates include all RBC global operations, excluding hourly employees, students, co-ops, RBC Career Launch participants, and City National Bank and BlueBay Asset Management employees. 18 Information covers approximately 80% of operations. Absences include workplace injury, incidental sick days and family responsibility leave as reported using our Vacation and Absence Manager system. 19 Introduced in fiscal 2021, Inclusive Experiences composite score is our measure for understanding the experiences of our employees across three core pillars of inclusion, including Psychological Safety, Respect/ Trust and Sense of Belonging. It is based on extensive research on the drivers of inclusion and is a composite of eight questions in our annual Employee Engagement Survey (EES). Percentage reflects the number of respondents who answered “Strongly Agree” or “Agree” to the indicated eight questions. In 2021, the EES response rate was 76%. 20 The Client Experience score aggregates client satisfaction and loyalty scores across our business segments using independent professional research and technology companies, and evaluates our competitiveness through industry benchmarks including Ipsos Customer Satisfaction Index and J.D. Power’s various client satisfaction studies. Results include Personal & Commercial Banking and RBC Insurance. Results do not include RBC Dominion Securities, PH&N, RBC Capital Markets or RBC Investor & Treasury Services. 21 As determined through Canadian Financial Monitor, administered by Ipsos Reid, which surveys 18,000 Canadian individuals annually. Data based on results of RBC and its competitive peers for the fiscal year. RBC includes Personal Banking and RBC Wealth Management. 22 Our goal is to exceed the Canadian peer average. 23 In 2019, the tracking of this metric changed from client households in Canada that hold multiple RBC products to client individuals in Canada that hold multiple RBC products. As a result, values in previous years are not comparable. 24 Self-serve channels include ATMs (automated teller machines), IVR (interactive voice response), Online Banking and Mobile Banking for both Personal and Business clients. 25 The ratio of digitally active users (distinct clients with at least one open product who authenticated in Online Banking or Mobile Banking during the period from August 1 to October 31) to total clients. Online Banking and Mobile Banking are RBC’s flagship digital products offered to Canadian Personal and Business Clients. 26 This material references the Global Reporting Initiative’s Disclosure 201: Economic Performance. Distributed value comprises operating expenses, human resources, taxes, donations and community investments, and cash dividends. 27 Cumulative, year over year. 28 Diverse is defined here as survey respondents who self-identify as one or more of the following: non-binary gender, not born in Canada, in Canada less than five years, BIPOC, LGBTQ+, person with a disability. 29 Data collected using the RBC Future Launch survey. Percentage reflects the number of respondents who answered “Strongly Agree” or “Agree” to the statement “I feel better prepared for the work after participating in this program”, divided by the total number of respondents. 30 Our reporting in 2019, 2020 and 2021 represents 99% of our global floor area. 31 As a responder and signatory to CDP, RBC publicly reports multi-year data on absolute and intensity-based GHG emissions (Scope 1 and Scope 2) calculated according to the GHG Protocol. The GHG Protocol classifies a company’s GHG emissions into three scopes. Scope 1 emissions are direct emissions from owned or controlled sources. Scope 2 emissions are indirect emissions from the generation of purchased energy. Scope 3 emissions are all indirect emissions (not included in Scope 2) that occur in the value chain of the reporting company, including both upstream and downstream emissions. Under Scope 3, RBC reports the emissions resulting from employees’ business travel. Our GHG emissions reduction goal is calculated based on a 70% reduction compared to our fiscal 2018 GHG emissions (Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3) minus emissions offset from renewable energy credits from purchases and power purchase agreements. Aligned with the science-based target methodologies based on the guidance for real estate and office properties. 32 Inclusive of total income and other tax expenses, including income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and Changes in Equity, to various levels of governments globally. See page 97 of the 2021 Annual Report for more information. 33 Calculated as total income and other taxes as a percentage of income before income taxes and other taxes. See page 23 of the 2021 Annual Report for more information. 34 The number of reports received through hotlines for 2021 includes all RBC entities (City National Bank and BlueBay Asset Management as well). BlueBay’s Hotline was launched in May 2021, and City National Bank’s Ethics Hotline was launched in July 2019. 35 Credit risk assessments reviewed for E&S risk do not reflect the total level of credit issued by the business, rather the level of credit issued where the E&S team had formal input. Transactions that require an E&S risk review are defined by RBC’s E&S Risk Management policies. There is not a direct correlation between the number and value of credit risk assessments reviewed for E&S risk. 36 Metric represents all RBC employees under 30 excluding hourly, inactive leave of absence, income protection, City National Bank and BlueBay Asset Management employees. 37 Contract workers at RBC as at October 31 in each respective year, with various term assignments. The number of contractors can vary throughout the year based on a number of factors given our business needs. In 2021, we employed between 1,400 and 1,700 contract workers in any given quarter. The number of contractors represents individuals who are retained by RBC on a contractual but not an employment basis to provide services. 38 All employees represented are in our European and Caribbean operations.

Endnotes 81 Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, government officials imposed a series of restrictions that led to the cancellation and reduction in size of in-person and large-scale live events in 2020 and 2021. As a result, many RBC-sponsored programs were cancelled, postponed or shifted to a digital format, leading to another yearover-year reduction in spending. 82 Photo courtesy of BluEarth Renewables showing its Yellow Lake and Burdett Solar Facility.

85 This goal is inclusive of our global operations, Scope 1, 2 and 3 (business travel) emissions, and uses a baseline of 2018.
86 The Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) is an industry-led partnership to facilitate transparency and enable financial institutions to assess and disclose greenhouse gas emissions of loans and investments.
87 As of October 31, 2021. Showcased in megatons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e). Each of our asset classes measured covers a percentage of our total loan and investment balances. Gaps in measurement exist due to a lack of data availability both internally and externally to measure financed emissions for the entirety of our lending. In total our measurement covers approximately 95% of the total loan and investment balances related to the six PCAF asset classes. Each of the individual asset classes have some variability in the total loan and investment balances measured and will fluctuate as we refine our inclusions and exclusions. Financed emissions are calculated based on the best available score, which includes a mix of PCAF data Scores 1 to 5 (primarily Score 5 as discussed herein) and includes Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Emissions calculated using Score 5 data may be materially different from emissions calculated using Score 1 data. In addition, emissions calculated using Score 5 data have a high degree of uncertainty as to their accuracy. We continue to evaluate our approach to measuring financed emissions and will continue to refine our measurement. See “Important Notice Regarding this Report”. We are working towards disclosing material methodology changes and highlighting their impact on total balances analyzed and financed emissions in future disclosures.
88 Covers 95% of business loan balances. PCAF Score 5 has been used for the majority of the business loans measurement. S&P Global Trucost data and S&P Global Capital IQ data have been used to measure for PCAF data Scores 1 to 4. The PCAF methodology for business loans and unlisted equity has also been applied to project finance and commercial real estate assets with an unknown use of proceeds. Unlisted equity is not currently measured as part of the business loan measurement. We expect to refine the measurement of this asset class in future disclosures as methodologies mature and data become available.
89 Covers 96% of Canadian residential mortgage balances. Excludes home equity lines of credit and nonCanadian mortgages, including those from City National Bank.
90 Covers 99% of motor vehicle loan balances related to automotive vehicles. Excludes loans associated with other vehicle types such as marine vehicles and recreation vehicles.
91 Covers 85% of commercial real estate mortgage balances. General purpose commercial real estate loans are currently captured within business loans.
92 Covers 89% of listed equity and corporate bonds. S&P Global Trucost data and S&P Global Capital IQ data have been used to measure this asset class for PCAF data Scores 1 to 4, and PCAF Score 5 has been used for the remaining balances.
93 The utilities sector is classified under our Business Loans asset class. This is currently being measured using PCAF Score 5 and also S&P Global Trucost data and S&P Global Capital IQ data for Scores 1 to 4. Due to a lack of granularity within our internal Standard Industry Classification codes for power generation, when using data Score 5 we are primarily using emission factors related to fossil fuel power generation. As such, emissions related to our utility portfolio may be overestimated and will be re-classified with the appropriate sectoral emission factors in future measurement and disclosure.
94 “Other” includes all other RBC sector groups such as consumer discretionary, industrial products, information technology, mining & metals, real estate & related, and transportation, among others.
95 As defined by the UNEP FI Guidelines for Climate Target Setting for Banks. 96 The total available loan balances are defined as the aggregate loan amounts made to clients in high-emitting sectors in oil & gas, power & utilities, and automotive & transportation portfolios in our Capital Markets business.
97 The year-over-year decrease in 2021 is the result of moving to a more efficient building in London, UK.

Independent practitioner’s limited assurance report on select key performance indicators presented within Royal Bank of Canada’s 2021 Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Performance Report. 
To the Board of Directors and Management of Royal Bank of Canada (“RBC”)
We have undertaken a limited assurance engagement on the following select key performance indictors detailed below (the selected information) presented within RBC’s 2021 ESG Performance Report for the year ended October 31, 2021.
Selected information Our limited assurance engagement was performed on the following selected key performance indicators:

GHG reductions from green power purchases (tonnes of CO2e) 73. 
Carbon credits purchased (tonnes of CO2e) 73. 
Management’s responsibility Management is responsible for preparation of the selected information in accordance with the definition of each performance indicator as presented in the Endnotes section of the 2021 ESG Performance Report on pages 75, 76 and 77 (the applicable criteria). Management is also responsible for selecting the applicable criteria used. Management is also responsible for such internal control as management determines necessary to enable the preparation of the selected information that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Our responsibility Our responsibility is to express limited assurance conclusion on the selected information based on the evidence we have obtained. We conducted our limited assurance engagement in accordance with the Canadian Standard on Assurance Engagements (CSAE) 3000, Attestation Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information, the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000, Attestation Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information, CSAE 3410, Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements, and ISAE 3410, Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements. These standards require that we plan and perform this engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether the selected information is free from material misstatement.
A limited assurance engagement involves performing procedures (primarily consisting of making inquiries of management and others within the entity, as appropriate, and applying analytical procedures) and evaluating the evidence obtained. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the decisions of users of our report. The procedures are selected based on our professional judgment, which includes identifying areas where the risks of material misstatement in preparing the selected information in accordance with the criteria are likely to arise.
Our engagement included, among others, the following procedures performed: ● Making enquiries of management to obtain an understanding the overall governance and internal control environment relevant to the management, aggregation and reporting of the selected information; ● Analytical reviews and trend analysis of reported data for the selected information; ● Agreeing and testing the underlying data related to the selected information on a sample basis; ● Limited testing of the retirement of carbon credits to underlying financial records.
The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement and, consequently, the level of assurance obtained is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed.
Our independence and quality control. 
We have complied with the relevant rules of professional conduct/code of ethics applicable to the practice of public accounting and related to assurance engagements, issued by various professional accounting bodies, which are founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behavior.
The firm applies Canadian Standard on Quality Control 1, Quality Control for Firms that Perform Audits and Reviews of Financial Statements, and Other Assurance Engagements and, accordingly, maintains a comprehensive system of quality control, including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
Significant inherent limitations. 
Emissions and energy use data are subject to inherent limitations given the nature and the methods used for determining such data. The selection of different but acceptable measurement techniques can result in materially different measurements. The precision of different measurement techniques may also vary.
Conclusion. 
Based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that RBC’s selected information during the year ended October 31, 2021, is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the applicable criteria.
Purpose of statement and restriction on use of our report The selected information has been prepared in accordance with the applicable criteria to assist RBC’s management to report to the Board of Directors the selected information. As a result, the selected information may not be suitable for another purpose. Our report is intended solely for RBC. We neither assume nor accept any responsibility or liability to any third party in respect of this assurance report. Chartered Professional Accountants.

SASB Disclosure. 
The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) Foundation is an independent, non-profit standard-setting organization that develops and maintains robust reporting standards that enable businesses around the world to identify, manage and communicate financially material sustainability information to their investors. SASB standards are evidence-based, developed with broad market participation and designed to be cost-effective for companies and decision-useful for investors. For more information, visit sasb.org.
Scope. 
This index covers the SASB sector standards that we have determined to be most relevant to our business activities: Asset Management and Custody Activities; Commercial Banks; Consumer Finance; Investment Banking and Brokerage; and Mortgage Finance. As a diversified financial institution, RBC’s operations fall into several SASB sector standards, and we have outlined our alignment with those sector standards below. Disclosure metrics that appear in more than one sector standard are grouped together and indicated as such. We do not currently disclose all disclosure topics or accounting metrics included in these sector standards; however we will continue to evaluate them for disclosure in the future. As the SASB sector standards have been developed from a U.S. perspective, there are some that are not entirely applicable to Canadian-based financial institutions such as RBC; however, where possible, we have attempted to disclose information based on similar Canadian requirements.

Global Systemically Important Bank (G-SIB) score, by category FN-CB-550a.1 FN-IB-550a.1 On November 23, 2021, we were re-designated as a G-SIB by the Financial Stability Board. Please refer to page 101 of the 2021 Annual Report. This designation requires us to maintain a higher loss absorbency requirement (common equity as a percentage of riskweighted assets) of 1%. We have also been identified as a domestic systemically important bank (D-SIB) by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Canada (OSFI).
