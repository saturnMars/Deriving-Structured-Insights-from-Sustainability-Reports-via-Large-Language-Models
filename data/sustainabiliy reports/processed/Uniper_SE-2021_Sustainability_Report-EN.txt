How Uniper contributes to the SDGs 3


Uniper Sustainability Report 2021. 
GRI 102-14 Sustainability is high on our agenda. It lies at the core of Uniper’s strategy and purpose – Empower Energy Evolution. I am proud of what we have already achieved on our chosen path towards decarbonization and sustainability.
Looking ahead, in light of the impacts of the dreadful Russia-Ukraine war, Uniper bears a special responsibility to diversify and secure the European energy supply. We operate critical infrastructure and supply energy to large parts of the German industry and many people in Germany and across Europe. It is of utmost importance to maintain the existing energy flows, and at the same time find ways and means to make the gas supply for Germany and Europe more diverse and thus less vulnerable to geopolitical risks. This report highlights how we manage the challenges of securing and diversifying our energy supply, while remaining fully committed to achieving our climate targets.
Uniper is serious about global warming. Not only are we well ahead of our initial plan to phase out coal-fired generation in Europe to meet our 2035 climate neutrality target for the European Generation segment, we’ve also set ourselves a new goal. In December 2021, we and Fortum announced a Scope 3 emissions reduction target: to reduce indirect emissions by 35% by 2035, compared to the base year 2021. This report presents the steps Uniper is taking to reach our climate targets and enable the energy transition; from exciting developments in our hydrogen and renewable energy businesses, to successful feasibility studies on carbon-free fuel for our gas turbines.
I am proud that we have also increased our ambitions in other sustainability topics, such as just transition. As we close our coal-fired power plants, we are committed to ensuring a fair transition for the employees that work on-site and for our value chain. In the area of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), we adopted a new Company- wide strategy. Our vision is to embrace DEI in everything that we do. We want to empower all employees to seize their full potential – it’s only then that Uniper can reach its full potential.
Our employees are our most valuable asset. As the Covid-19 pandemic continued in 2021, I am pleased that we could support the employees with our extensive health and well-being program. In addition to offering our German employees Covid-19 vaccinations, we could further support our employees working from home by providing ergonomic office equipment. We are paving the way for a hybrid working environment with the NewNormal working style which provides maximum flexibility for employees.
The 2021 Sustainability Report highlights Uniper’s successes – but also shows that we still have many important steps to take to achieve our targets, some of which were not met in 2021. Our climate targets for 2030, 2035, and 2050 are ambitious. Despite extensive emissions reductions since 2015, we still have quite some challenges ahead to decarbonize while tackling the growing challenges of ensuring a secure energy supply going forward.
I am confident that we are on the right path and I look forward to further delivering on Uniper’s commitment to Empower Energy Evolution.

Uniper Sustainability Report 2021. 
GRI 102-45/50 Uniper has published an annual Sustainability Report for each year since 2016, when we became an independent company. This is therefore our sixth Sustainability Report. It is available in English and German. It presents information about our most material sustainability issues, how we manage them, and what we achieved in the reporting period. The reporting period is the 2021 calendar year; however, the report also includes information about noteworthy subsequent events through March 2022. Unless otherwise indicated, the scope of the report is the Uniper Group’s fully consolidated assets as of December 31, 2021. The scope of consolidation is the same as in our 2021 Annual Financial Report. This report contains information about our reporting principles and all significant changes in Uniper’s size, scope, ownership structure, and supply chain. There were several personnel changes in the Uniper Supervisory Board and the Board of Management in 2021. In March 2021, Prof. Dr. Klaus-Dieter Maubach and Tiina Tuomela were appointed to the Board of Management as CEO and CFO. At the same time, Markus Rauramo took over as Chairman of the Supervisory Board with Dr. Bernhard Günther as new Vice Chairman.

GRI 102-54 This report’s description of our materiality assessment and management approach reflects the Global Reporting Initiative’s standards (GRI). The report uses GRI indicators to disclose information on selected issues; their use is referenced in each instance. We are working toward reporting 100% in accordance with the GRI Standards: Core Option to provide our stakeholders with an even more comprehensive overview. Sections of this report that fulfill a GRI standard are identified with the corresponding standard.
GRI 102-49 Changes in reporting: in 2021, the list of material topics was revised and expanded. The new topics resulted from discussions with stake- holders and a closer alignment with Fortum for a common list of material topics. The new material topics are Just Transition, Shared Value Creation and Customer Rights and Satisfaction. Furthermore, Digitalization was added to the existing topic Innovation. The materiality assessment was expanded in 2021 to better incorporate the views of our most important stakeholders. The materiality matrix was adjusted accordingly. In 2021, Uniper began to review the current Sustainability Strategic Plan (SSP) together with Fortum to systematically reflect on the priority material issues and, where relevant, update the ambition for the company.

Uniper Sustainability Report 2021. 
The geopolitical situation in Europe has changed dramatically. On 24th February 2022, Russia began a widespread invasion of Ukraine. Uniper condemns the Russian invasion of Ukraine in the strongest possible terms. With this war, Russia is breaking international law and the principles of the UN Charter.
Several decisions and measures have been taken by Uniper since the beginning of the Russia-Ukraine war. These are not fully reflected in the Sustainability Report and have therefore been outlined below:
Divestment process of Unipro: The divestment process of Russian subsidiary Unipro was started confidentially some time ago, and due to the ongoing war has been paused. The process will be resumed when possible. Unipro’s activities are ongoing including the power plant modernization program. However, Uniper will not make any new investments in Russia and will not transfer any funds to Unipro until further notice. It is currently impossible to predict how potential Russian sanctions could affect Unipro’s business and financial situation. Unipro’s most important goal at the moment is the secure operation of its plants and the fulfillment of its delivery obligations to its customers.
Overview Planet People & Society Responsible Governance Appendix Nord Stream 2: Uniper has taken the decision to record a full impairment loss on the Nord Stream 2 financial investment.
Long-term gas import contracts with Russia: Existing long-term gas import contracts with Russia remain an essential part of a secure European gas supply. While Uniper seeks to ensure gas supply to its customers in Germany and Europe, it will not enter into any new long-term supply contracts for natural gas with Russia.
Diversification of supply sources and proactive measures taken to strengthen security of supply: In order to diversify supply sources and as requested by the German government, Uniper plans to bring LNG directly to the German market, and has therefore resumed its planning for an LNG terminal in Wilhelmshaven. Uniper is also prepared to prolong coal-fired power generation at its German and UK sites scheduled for closure should they be requested by the national governments. Uniper has decided not to extend its Russian coal supply contracts beyond 2022. Uniper already procures hard coal from a wide variety of regions worldwide and is executing a transitional coal diversification strategy.

Uniper Sustainability Report 2021. 
Overview Planet People & Society Responsible Governance Appendix. 
GRI 102-15/40/44/46/47/49 Understanding our stakeholders’ views and expectations is crucial to our Company’s success and the public’s acceptance of our operations. We conduct an annual materiality assessment to identify which issues our sustainability efforts should focus on most. An issue’s materiality reflects its relevance to our business, our stakeholders, and the estimated magnitude of its impact on Uniper.
We consider the expectations of a variety of stakeholders. In 2021, stakeholder expectations were compiled by means of interviews and surveys in which participants were asked to rate the importance of Uniper’s material issues. Participants included employees and representatives from our main external stakeholder groups, such as non- governmental organizations (NGOs), customers, and investors.
The findings of the 2021 assessment led to several changes relative to 2020. We added just transition, customer rights and satisfaction, and shared value creation as material issues. We believe each is essential to Uniper.
The following materiality matrix provides an overview of the assessment’s findings. The horizontal axis indicates the issues’ impact on Uniper’s business. The vertical axis indicates the issues’ relevance from a stakeholders’ perspective. Uniper classifies issues that are of high importance on both axes as material. The result is eight material issues, each of which is addressed in this report. Diversity, equity, and inclusion is included as the ninth material issue. This issue is integral to the Uniper corporate culture and, as in previous years, was rated very high in terms of its impact and relevance for internal stakeholders. It thus remains material. The various sections of this report describe Uniper’s management approach for the issues, the progress it achieved in the reporting period, and, where appropriate, exceptions to its definition of materiality.

Uniper Materiality Matrix. 
Sustainability is one of Uniper’s most important issues. Our strategy and purpose – Empower Energy Evolution – are fully dedicated to it. In 2021 we performed an extensive materiality analysis to reassess which sustainability topics are most material for Uniper. Taking into account the new material topics, our sustainability strategy was subsequently strengthened with more focused commitments and targets to further improve Uniper’s sustainability performance.

Uniper Sustainability Report 2021. 
GRI 102-15/49 Uniper’s strategy is to meet rising energy demand while simultaneously propelling the transition to a carbon-neutral future. Uniper will steadily decarbonize its business and help its customers decarbonize theirs. For Uniper, this involves providing the energy that people and companies need today while taking the smart, steady steps that lead to a thriving and sustainable tomorrow. Uniper’s strategy, for these changing times, has three interrelated components: decarbonization, customer centricity, and security of supply.
Uniper’s corporate strategy, which was announced in early 2020, supports and promotes the transition to a low-carbon economy while addressing security of supply. We foster a sustainable growth transformation and create shared value as we move towards neutrality.
Based on the materiality analysis, Uniper has developed the Sustainability Strategic Plan (SSP) to appropriately address all relevant aspects of sustainability when implementing the corporate strategy. Commitments, targets, and indicators were defined for all topics, and progress and guidance were measured and steered.
Overview Planet People & Society Responsible Governance Appendix In 2021 Uniper – in consultation with its main shareholder Fortum – reviewed the SSP 2018–2022. The review focused on material issues that had been reprioritized based on the findings of the 2021 materiality analysis and their strategic relevance for Uniper. The review consisted of in-house stakeholder workshops with Fortum to reflect on our approach and priorities to promote foresightful planning on each issue.
The Uniper Sustainability Council serves as a leadership sounding board on the progress and the outcomes of the SSP review process. Its feedback in early 2022 provided key guidance for the formulation of renewed commitments for the SSP’s horizon beyond 2022.
Uniper aims to build on its potential for business growth and engage in active management to minimize its operations’ main negative ESG (environmental, social, and governance) impacts. The SSP targets are built around a set of long-term commitments that reflect core elements of Uniper’s corporate culture and strategy.
Based on the initial results of the SSP review in early 2022, the Uniper Board of Management approved renewed commitments and targets (for selected topics) for the following material issues: overall environment matters (including biodiversity as a focus topic), diversity, equity, and inclusion, and just transition. The following sections provide further insights into our management approach for material issues and our approach with the new commitments.
The new SSP structure groups the material issues derived from the materiality assessment into three categories: Planet, People & Society and Responsible Governance. These categories provide the framework for specific commitments, action plans, and annual progress reviews in alignment with selected UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). See the revised SSP table on the next page.
The SSP is Uniper’s main tool for defining and managing appropriate risk- mitigation and impact- remediation measures for each material issue during a specific time frame. This accords with the recommendations of international frameworks, such as the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. The SSP aims to adopt new processes, such as systematic qualitative analysis of the scope, scale, and remediability our ESG impacts. It also seeks to not only mitigate impacts, but, where relevant, take proactive steps and seize opportunities to have a positive impact on ESG issues. The HSSE & Sustainability function tracks progress toward SSP targets and reports on it by means of quarterly reviews for the Board of Management and senior managers. Uniper discloses its progress on at least an annual basis.

How Uniper contributes to the SDGs 10


Uniper Sustainability Report 2021. 
The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015, provides a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and into the future. At its heart are the 17 SDGs, an urgent call for action by all countries in a global partnership. They recognize that ending poverty and other deprivations must go hand-in-hand with strategies that improve health and education, reduce inequality, and spur economic growth – all while tackling climate change and working to preserve our oceans and forests. (Source: www.praeventionstag.de)
Overview Planet People & Society Responsible Governance Appendix How Uniper contributes to the SDGs. 
Gender Equality. 
Uniper participated in Girls’ Day 2021 – Future Prospects for Girls, an annual initiative under the patronage of the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research. Its purpose is to give girls the opportunity to learn more about STEM careers (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) and spur their interest in embarking on one.
Our employee-led resource groups are instrumental in fostering inclusion, promoting equality and advocating DEI. All these groups continued their activities in 2021 using virtual means and increased their membership. The biggest group is Women at Uniper with more than 920 members.
E Diversity, equity, and inclusion chapter. 
Goal 5. 
Affordable and Clean Energy. 
In September 2021, Uniper entered into a strategic partnership with Denmark-based Ørsted AB, a leading developer of offshore wind projects. The companies have committed themselves to jointly develop large scale offshore wind capacity.
Uniper and Fortum established a joint organization for European onshore wind and solar generation. In December 2021, the first joint renewables project was announced; a 380 MW wind park expected to be fully operational mid-2024.
E Climate change and greenhouse gas emissions chapter. 
Goal 7. 
Decent Work and Economic Growth. 
Our 18- to 24-month trainee program for high- potential university graduates is one of the ways in which we ensure that we have an ample pipeline of talent. In 2021, 25 new trainees joined the program. More than 95% of those who completed the program between 2016 and year-end 2021 took on a permanent role at Uniper.
Uniper offers benefits packages that vary by country, excellent working conditions including flexible working hours, and the opportunity to work from home, which makes it easier to balance work and private life. The 2021 Voice of Uniper (VoU) survey results show that employees’ satisfaction with Uniper as an employer was high.
E Fair and attractive employer chapter. 
Goal 8. 
We recognize the importance of all the 17 SDGs and fully support them. We have prioritized ten SDGs that are particularly relevant to our business activities, strategy, and material topics.
Here are some examples of how Uniper contributed to the ten prioritized goals in 2021.

Climate Action. 
In 2021 Uniper developed a reduction target for Scope 3 indirect carbon emissions (those that occur upstream and downstream in the value chain). In December 2021 it was announced that Uniper aims to reduce indirect carbon emissions (Scope 3) by 35% by 2035 compared to 2021 as the base year.
In 2021, Uniper launched Net Zero Solutions, offering products and services for a systematic decarbonization of economic activities across all sectors. Uniper can help customers switch to a lower-carbon energy source and supply them with climate- friendly fuels like biomethane and renewable energy sourced under power-purchase agreements.
E Climate change and greenhouse gas emissions chapter. 
Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure. 
Uniper is working with several partners to produce renewable jet fuel for Rotterdam The Hague Airport. Equipment powered by renewable electricity will be used to capture CO2 from the air and convert it into green jet fuel.
Uniper continues to install battery systems at hydro plants to respond swiftly to frequency deviations and thus ensure grid stability. Battery systems at two Uniper hydro plants in northern Sweden, Edsele (6 MW) and Lövön (9 MW), became operational in early 2021.
E Innovation and digitalization chapter. 
Goal 9. 
Responsible Consumption and Production. 
Enfield, our 442 MW CCGT located in the UK, received a state-of-the-art upgrade. The improvement, which became operational in mid-2021, enables Enfield to consume less fuel to produce more power.
Coal power plant closures will significantly reduce the availability of the by-product coal fly ash, which our subsidiary BauMineral sells as a building material to the construction industry. BauMineral is therefore working to find alternative low-carbon building materials.

Climate change and greenhouse gas emissions. 
Overview Planet People & Society Responsible Governance Appendix. 
GRI 103-1/2 Climate change is one of the world’s biggest challenges and one of our Company's most material long-term issues. We take our responsibility for climate protection seriously. Europe’s energy transition is under way, and we are actively shaping it. To help implement the Paris Agreement, we are working to help gradually decarbonize the energy system while simultaneously ensuring a reliable energy supply.
Our decarbonization strategy. 
GRI 102-11/15, 103-2 Decarbonization is Uniper’s top priority. In 2020 Uniper announced a strategy which foresees a gradual transformation into a greener, more sustainable company. Uniper has pledged to be a carbon-neutral company by 2050. We aim for our generation business in Europe to achieve carbon neutrality for its Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2035 and to reduce these emissions by 50% by 2030 relative to 2019. In late 2021 we formulated a group-wide target for Scope 3 (indirect) emissions, which we intend to reduce by 35% by 2035 relative to 2021.
To support these commitments, Uniper plans to invest significantly in growth projects, particularly renewables and hydrogen. Together with our main shareholder Fortum, we aim to have 1.5 to 2 GW of renewables capacity by 2025 and up to 3 GW beyond. We also intend to have 1 GW of electrolysis capacity for green hydrogen by 2030.
New green energy businesses. 
GRI 302-2 In the area of renewable power generation, Uniper and Fortum have established a joint organization for developing wind and solar projects in Europe. The organization combines the two companies’ expertise in renewables development, asset operations, and asset management. In December 2021 the first joint project was announced. In partnership with the Finnish energy company Helen Ltd, Pjelax- Böle and Kristinestad Norr wind farms will be built near Finland’s west coast. The farms’ 54 turbines, which have an aggregate capacity of 380 MW, are expected to be fully operational by mid-2024. In September 2021 Unipers renewables business entered into a strategic partnership with Denmark- based Ørsted, a leading developer of offshore wind projects. The purpose is to collaborate on large-scale offshore wind farms.
Uniper is a hydrogen pacesetter. We were one of Europe’s first energy companies to use renewable power to run electrolysis equipment to produce zero-carbon green hydrogen. Uniper has a large pipeline of projects to produce low-carbon hydrogen in Europe and also to import and trade hydrogen and its derivatives like ammonia, methanol, and sustainable fuels. This project pipeline will help provide Germany and Europe with the low-carbon hydrogen they need for a successful energy transition. In addition, our gas and storage infrastructure and extensive experience in origination, optimization, trading, and risk management position us very well for hydrogen and for biomethane.

Uniper Sustainability Report 2021. 
Mapping methane emissions. 
GRI 102-12 Identifying, quantifying, and minimizing fugitive methane emissions along the gas value chain is essential. Methane’s global warming potential is estimated to be at least 28 times that of carbon dioxide over a 100-year horizon and even greater on a 20-year horizon (the time horizon describes the period of time over which methane impacts are considered). In 2020 Uniper became a founding member of the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership (OGMP) 2.0, a voluntary initiative to help ensure that oil and gas companies report and reduce methane emissions based on harmonized and reliable methods. It also aims to foster transparency and share best practices. It has a target as well: for the industry as a whole to reduce its methane emissions by 45% by 2025 relative to 2015. Uniper is committed to closely monitoring and recording its methane emissions in accordance with OGMP’s established methodologies. In 2021, OGMP recognized Uniper Energy Storage’s methane reporting as the “gold standard.” Uniper’s gas storage business identified the importance of fugitive methane emissions early on and has substantially reduced them since 2015. Small methane leaks occur at our storage and measurement and control facilities. Uniper has technical and organizational measures in place to minimize these emissions and we are currently working on technologies to identify and repair potential sources of methane emissions on our assets to further reduce emissions. Technologies such as these will help Uniper on its way of reducing its methane emissions and will play a major role in a decarbonized future.
In October 2021 Uniper joined 14 gas infrastructure operators and gas associations in Europe in a project led by the European Gas Research Group (GERG) and Spanish gas grid operator Enagás. Its purpose is to deploy new and improved technologies to curb methane emissions in midstream gas infrastructure.
Environmental products in North America Uniper is helping make North America’s power greener. Our green PPA portfolio enables us to provide downstream customers in North America with more than 19 million MWh of low- or zero- carbon, cost-efficient energy. Demand for clean energy is growing. Consequently, Uniper intends to quadruple its North American green PPA portfolio by 2025. The demand for energy management and support services is growing, too. Organizations need to enhance their operational efficiency and energy-use transparency. Uniper’s initial focus will be on providing customers with access to, and settlement management services in, the primary US markets for carbon allowances and offsets. In 2022 we will also start offering customers green gas, certified natural gas, and renewable natural gas. We are exploring export opportunities for green ammonia, which can be transformed into green hydrogen.

Greener commodity trading. 
GRI 103-2 As already stated, Uniper aims to reduce the group-wide Scope 3 (indirect) carbon emissions by 35% by 2035 relative to 2021. Most Scope 3 emissions are attributable to the Global Commodities segment. Gas will play a key role as a bridge to a zero-carbon future by replacing coal, ensuring a secure supply for heat, power, and industrial processes, and providing flexibility in the power system. Gas will therefore remain an important focus of our commodity trading. At the same time, Uniper will strive to make gas-based businesses more sustainable by exploring ways to decarbonize upstream and downstream emissions. It will work with its suppliers and customers on efforts to reduce these indirect emissions. Our gas storage business, for example, is a member of a global alliance dedicated to reducing fugitive methane emissions. We also intend to leverage our position as a leading gas merchant by helping to establish global trade in climate- neutral gases and other climate- friendly energy carriers. We already trade helium in the United States and will soon be adding hydrogen and hydrogen-related commodities to our global business portfolio.
Uniper trades green power as well. We expect our portfolio of long-term solar and wind power purchase agreements (PPAs) to reaching 5 TWh per annum by 2023. Under a PPA, Uniper or another counterparty agrees to buy a percentage of the output of a future renewables asset for a set period (typically 10 or 15 years) at an agreed price. PPAs give renewables developers financial security and enable Uniper to grow its renewables portfolio. We have PPAs with wind and solar farms in Norway, Sweden, Spain, and the United States and intend to conclude more. In 2021, for example, we concluded a 15-year PPA for wind energy in New Mexico.

Uniper Sustainability Report 2021. 
Companies of all sizes and in all sectors want to decarbonize. This in part to do the right thing, but also to satisfy stricter regulations, cut costs, preserve their reputation, and access capital in an increasingly sustainability-oriented financial market. Uniper aims to become the go-to partner for decarbonization solutions. We also want to forge long-term relationships and accompany customers along their entire decarb journey. Our catalog of solutions has four main categories: • Design and enable: we design a detailed, individually tailored decarbonization road map and offer enabling solutions (project financing, marketing support) to make it a reality. • Reduce and enhance: we show customers how to reduce their energy consumption and enhance their operations through data-based maintenance and optimization. • Switch and supply: we help customers switch their on-site generation to a lower-carbon energy source and supply them with hydrogen, biomethane, and other green fuels. • Offset and recycle: we assist customers in offsetting their unavoidable emissions or capturing and recycling them.
Our approach is tailored to each customer’s individual objectives, circumstances, and budget. For the most ambitious, we can design a road map to guide them all the way to carbon neutrality. For all, we can help them find government subsidies or arrange funding that makes their decarbonization journey as affordable as possible.
In May 2021 Uniper launched a website called Index Net Zero. It presents the findings of a survey of the decarbonization agendas of about 500 German companies in seven key industries: automotive, chemicals, fast- moving consumer goods (FMCG), glass and ceramics, metals, pulp and paper, and municipal utilities and other energy companies. Companies can use the website to compare their decarbonization ambitions with those of their industry peers or with other industries.

Uniper takes part in Climate Action 100+ The Climate Action 100+ Net-Zero Company Benchmark assesses the performance of companies against the initiative’s three key goals: improve governance of climate risks and opportunities, reduce GHG emissions in line with goals of the Paris Agreement, and provide enhanced disclosure aligned with the recommendations of the TCFD. The benchmark helps investor signatories evaluate companies’ ambitions and actions in tackling climate change using ten disclosure indicators and their related sub-indicators and metrics. In 2021, Uniper was invited to report to Climate Action 100+, and following an assessment Uniper received a rating for each of the criteria along with guidance on areas for improvement. Uniper will review this information to determine which elements it can implement.
It should now be clear why we cannot continue as we have done for the last 100 years. But as an established company with existing assets, how do we make it in the new world? Uniper supports energy- intensive industrial companies in achieving decarbonization, offering a new perspective and hopefully inspiring action. True to the motto 'If you don’t prepare, you prepare to fail,' we show how tangible the necessary steps of decarbonization become once the development of a decarbonization strategy is initiated.
Daniel Stegmann, Net Zero Solutions. 
Modernization in Russia Unipro, our power generation subsidiary in Russia, is exploring options for decarbonizing its operations over the long term. Unipro is participating in Russia’s large modernization program that seeks to modernize around 40 GW of fossil-fueled generating capacity – about 16% of Russia’s total capacity – by 2032. The program is conducted through auctions in which power producers submit bids for generating units to be refurbished or replaced. The first auctions selected five gas-fired generating units totaling about 4 GW at Surgutskaya 2, a Unipro power station in Siberia. Modernization work began in 2021. One of the units is expected to be ready to return to service in 2022. Work on the others will continue through 2026. These modernizations will improve the environmental footprint through lower specific emissions of the produced power.

GRI 302-4, 305-4/5 At year-end 2021, Uniper owned and operated around 6 GW of coal-fired capacity in Europe. Most of this capacity will soon be closed. One unit (0.5 GW) at Ratcliffe power station in central England will be shut down in September 2022. Its other three units (1.5 MW) will stop operating by September 2024 at the latest. All of these dates are ahead of our previous schedule. Maasvlakte 3 (1.1 GW) in the Netherlands will close by year-end 2029. In 2021, three of our plants in Germany were chosen in the coal exit auctions conducted by the Federal Network Agency in 2021: Wilhelmshaven (757 MW) ended operations in December 2021; Scholven C (345 MW) will do so in October 2022. Staudinger 5 (510 MW) will cease commercial operations in May 2023. These, too, are all ahead of schedule. Heyden 4 (875 MW) will operate solely when the grid operator needs it to maintain grid reliability. Uniper’s only remaining coal-fired plant in Germany will be Datteln 4, one of the world’s most efficient. Current German law foresees its closure in 2038. Our lignite-fired power generation in Europe ended in October 2021 when we transferred our 58% stake in Schkopau power station to Saale Energie GmbH.
Coal generation capacity is therefore a steadily shrinking part of our portfolio. Roughly two-thirds of our total electricity and heat output already comes from low-emission hydro, nuclear, and gas. This proportion will increase and our carbon intensity will decrease as we close further coal-fired plants. This will bring us progressively closer to our goal of carbon neutrality. Nevertheless, our aim is to carry out plant closures in a socially responsible way and to use existing resources.
E Just transition chapter. 
Uniper’s coal-fired power plants have good locations and useful infrastructure, such as grid infrastructure equipment, rail links, and connections to district-heating networks. Uniper is convinced that this will enable them to play a vital role in a low-carbon economy after coal-fired power generation ends. We have therefore developed master plans to repurpose them.
Repurposing is already under way at Scholven, a Uniper coal-fired power station in west-central Germany. Two state-of-the-art combined-cycle gas turbines (CCGTs) are being installed. The CCGTs are scheduled to enter service in the fourth quarter of.

Energy efficiency 2022, replacing Scholven’s existing coal-fired unit, which will be retired earlier than originally planned. They will enable Scholven to continue to supply power and steam to nearby industrial enterprises, but with significantly lower carbon emissions.
In addition, in early 2021 we submitted a proposal to build the East Midlands Energy Re-Generation (EMERGE) Centre on the site of Ratcliffe. EMERGE would generate energy from nonhazardous, nonrecyclable waste. EMERGE would have a maximum electricity capacity of roughly 50 MW, enough to power around 90,000 homes. It could also supply heat to any businesses that locate nearby. Moreover, it would prevent about 0.5 million metric tons of residual waste from being landfilled or exported each year, helping the East Midlands meet its landfill diversion targets. We aim for the EMERGE Centre to be operational by 2025.
The master plans for two of our other coal-fired plants – Wilhelmshaven in Germany and Maasvlakte in the Netherlands – are described below in the section entitled “Uniper’s hydrogen strategy.”

Greenhouse Gas Protocol - Scope 1. 
GRI 305-1/4/5 In 2021 Uniper’s direct carbon emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels for power and heat generation (operational control approach) increased by 19% to 50.9 million metric tons (2020: 42.6 million metric tons). The reason for the increase is largely due to increased output from Uniper’s coal-fired power plants, namely Ratcliffe in the UK, Datteln 4 in Germany, and Shaturskaya in Russia. Datteln 4 was still in the test phase before becoming fully operational at the end of May 2020 and therefore had significantly shorter operating times than in 2021.
While direct carbon emissions increased, the carbon intensity remained stable in 2021 compared to the previous year.

Where possible, Scope 3 accounting methodologies were aligned with those of Fortum. As part of the review, the scope of category 3.11 was expanded to include not only emissions from the use of products sold to end users, but also to resellers. As part of our business as an energy merchant, we purchase products, such as gas and coal, and sell them to both end users, and resellers. Resellers are counterparties who offtake the product and sell further downstream.

In 2021, Scope 3 emissions totaled 106.4 million metric tons CO₂e, 78.1 million metric tons of which resulted from the use of sold products. For 2020, Uniper’s revised inventory indicates a total value of 96.9 million metric tons CO₂e for Scope 3, 77.3 million metric tons of which resulted from the use of sold products. The reason for the year-on-year increase in total Scope 3 emissions was mainly due to increased downstream and upstream commodity activities. Increased fuel combustion activities in Russia and the UK also contributed to the increase.
With the development of the Covid-19 pandemic, power demand recovered in 2021 compared with the prior year, improving market conditions for the use of Uniper’s power plant portfolio. This meant that Uniper’s power production from coal increased from 19.5 billion kWh in 2020 to 24 billion kWh in 2021 and production from gas increased from 53.9 to 62.1 billion kWh.

In my role as project integration lead for Grain, Enfield, and Taylor’s Lane power stations in South East England, one of my main activities is supporting Making Net Zero Possible. Until now we’ve conducted several studies in the UK looking at the potential of carbon capture and hydrogen to decarbonize our CCGTs, and we are planning a trial to test the potential of using biofuels as an alternative fuel in our OCGTs. I am also supporting Project Cavendish, on the Isle of Grain, where our Grain power station is located. Working with our partners, project Cavendish aims to build a 700 MW blue hydrogen production facility by 2026, increasing to 1.75 GW by 2030. The hydrogen produced could then be used to decarbonize the power, heating, and transport sectors in London and South East England. Being involved in these projects is very fulfilling as I am contributing to enabling the future net zero economy.
Laura Nomdedeu Ortiz, Project Integration Lead. 
Gas: a bridge technology. 
GRI 103-2 Gas plays a pivotal role in decarbonization as well as energy security. It will therefore remain a key focus of Uniper’s strategy. Uniper is a leading European natural gas importer, operator of gas storage facilities, and a global LNG trader. It also operates a large fleet of gas-fired power plants. Uniper intends to maintain its broadly diversified gas business, while focusing on progressively decarbonizing it as well.
The decarbonization of our gas turbine fleet in Europe is essential for the entire power business to achieve climate neutrality by 2035. Our project called Making Net Zero Possible (MNZP) is exploring ways to make it a reality. The three most promising are the combustion of hydrogen in gas turbines, the combustion of biofuels in gas turbines and boilers, and carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) for existing assets. MNZP is conducting feasibility studies and trials for each.

Case study: biofuels in gas turbines in Sweden Most of Uniper’s generation capacity in Sweden is zero-carbon hydro, nuclear, and wind. We also have a number of open-cycle gas turbines (OCGTs) there that run on diesel. They operate at comparatively few hours a year, primarily at times of high power demand. Their carbon emissions are therefore not high in absolute terms. To make our generation business in Europe climate- neutral by 2035, however, we need to find ways to replace fossil fuels with lower- carbon alternatives. As part of this process, the MNZP project conducted a trial at an OCGT in Malmö in the summer of 2021. The turbine ran on biofuel instead of diesel in all modes, from start-up to full load, with no difficulties. The fuel tested was a 100% carbon- neutral liquid biofuel. In the trial, which was the first of its kind, the biofuel displaced roughly 90% of the plant’s carbon emissions compared with diesel. NOx emissions were about the same, but other emissions (flue gas, SO2, and dust) were lower. The MNZP team is reviewing other Uniper plants for which biofuels might make sense and plans to conduct more trials in 2022.

In addition, we have already begun looking for sources of green ammonia that Wilhelmshaven can convert to green hydrogen. In mid-2021 Uniper entered into a cooperation agreement with HYPORT® Duqm, a major project to produce green hydrogen and green ammonia in Oman. We will now assess the business case for using HYPORT® Duqm as a supplier. HYPORT® Duqm expects to begin production in 2026.
Humber Industrial Cluster on England’s northeast coast is home to British Steel and other manufacturers as well as one-third of the country’s refining capacity. Uniper has joined companies like Equinor and National Grid Ventures in the Zero Carbon Humber Partnership, a project to make the cluster net zero carbon by 2040 enabling blue and green hydrogen and CCUS (carbon capture, utilization, and storage) solutions. We plan to use Killingholme, our power plant in the Humber area, as the site for a hydrogen hub with up to 720 MW of blue hydrogen production capacity and 100 MW of green hydrogen capacity. Design work for the blue hydrogen facility is scheduled to start in 2022. Production of green hydrogen could begin as early as 2025 and blue in 2027. In November 2021 the East Coast Cluster, of which the Zero Carbon project is a part, was selected as a Track-1 cluster in the UK government’s cluster sequencing process. This process is central to the United Kingdom’s strategy for deploying CCUS in industry.
GRI 102-12, 103-2 Because gas plays a pivotal role in decarbonization as well as energy security, it will remain a key focus of Uniper’s strategy. By gradually converting Uniper’s businesses from conventional gas to hydrogen, Uniper aims to help establish Europe’s hydrogen economy. Uniper sees hydrogen – alongside gas, renewables, and hydroelectricity – as an essential element of tomorrow’s low-emission energy mix. Hydrogen will be essential for decarbonizing major industries, such as steel and chemicals. In applications that cannot use green electricity directly, hydrogen and its derivatives create new opportunities for avoiding carbon emissions.
Uniper joined other renowned companies to become a founding member of the H2Global Foundation, an initiative launched in June 2021 by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi). The foundation will buy green hydrogen and its derivatives in other countries for import to Germany. Imports will be necessary because in the future Germany, like many other heavily industrialized countries, will need more hydrogen than it can produce domestically. The government subsidies will ensure that the green hydrogen is competitively priced relative to grey hydrogen. The aim is to accelerate the ramp-up of green hydrogen production capacity worldwide.
Uniper and its main shareholder, Fortum, have joined forces in hydrogen. The close cooperation has already improved access to the Nordic and the European market. The partnership in Bothnia Link H2, a hydrogen hub planned for Luleå on Sweden’s northeast coast, is one example. In addition, Uniper has assembled a large pipeline of projects to produce low-carbon hydrogen in Europe and also to import and trade hydrogen and its derivatives like ammonia, methanol, and sustainable fuels. Below we describe several of them.
We plan to make our decommissioned coal-fired power station in Wilhelmshaven on Germany’s North Sea coast the site of a major hydrogen hub. It will consist of an ammonia import terminal, a storage facility, and a cracker running on green power to transform low-carbon ammonia into hydrogen. We also intend to install electrolysis units – initially with 70 MW of capacity which will be expanded to 410 MW by 2030 – to produce green hydrogen on-site. The electrolysis units would also run on green power. One aspect of the aforementioned partnership with wind power developer Ørsted is to explore options for offshore wind farms to supply Wilhelmshaven. The hydrogen we produce could be fed into Germany’s future hydrogen pipeline system. We believe that our hub in Wilhelmshaven could meet about 15% of Germany’s hydrogen needs by 2030.

Case study: energy and green hydrogen hub at Maasvlakte The Netherlands continues to use more energy, and its demand for electricity is expected to double between now and 2040. It wants this energy to be increasingly sustainable. We believe Maasvlakte, our power station in Rotterdam’s port district, can play an important role. In September 2021 Uniper signed a memorandum of understanding with the Port of Rotterdam for Maasvlakte to produce green hydrogen by means of electrolysis. The production capacity would initially be 100 MW and later expanded to 500 MW. Maasvlakte’s infrastructure and location are ideal.
It is connected to the high­voltage grid and close to the North Sea wind farms that will power its electrolysis equipment. It also has a dock and unloading facilities. Finally, it would be connected to HyTransPort. RTM, a hydrogen pipeline currently under development. Maasvlakte could therefore produce, import, store, and transport green hydrogen, which will be essential for decarbonizing heavy industry. We plan to make a final investment decision in 2023. Our high­efficiency coal­fired power plant at Maasvlakte is already part of a circular economy. It provides nearby industrial enterprises with electricity, steam, and compressed air, and cofires some of their waste products.

Uniper Sustainability Report 2021 12.3 kilotons of sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions SO2 results primarily from the combustion of sulfurous coal. Flue-gas desulfurization (FDG) equipment captures about 90% of our SO2 emissions and prevents them from entering the atmosphere. We emitted 12.3 kilotons of SO2 in 2021, 3.9 kilotons more than in 2020.
43.2 kilotons of nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions Most NOx emissions are produced from the reaction between nitrogen and oxygen during combustion at high temperatures. Our gas- and coal-fired power stations emit NOx. In 2021, our NOx emissions increased by 4.7 kilotons.
1,218 tons of dust emissions Despite extensive filtering, the burning of coal and lignite in power stations results in some dust emissions. Dust emissions are defined as total dust and include particles with a diameter of 10 and 2.5 microns. Our dust (or particulate) emissions were 173 tons higher in 2021 than in 2020.

Overview Planet People & Society Responsible Governance Appendix Emissions to air, land, and water. 
GRI 103-1-3, 305-7 Emissions to air, land, and water is an important topic for stakeholders. Energy production results in the emissions of greenhouse gases as well as sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), dust, and wastewater. Their release could impact air, water, and/or soil quality. Uniper addresses these risks by ensuring that it meets all legal requirements, by implementing improvement programs where required, and by leveraging its expertise in combustion technology to reduce its facilities’ impact by using best- available techniques (BAT), including abatement technologies.
GRI 103-2 Emissions of SO2, NOx, and dust increased from 2020 to 2021. The reason for the increase is largely due to increased output from Uniper’s coal-fired power plants, namely Ratcliffe in the UK, Datteln 4 in Germany, and Shaturskaya in Russia.
Uniper has pledged that its generation portfolio in Europe will be carbon- neutral by 2035. This will significantly reduce its direct carbon emissions as well as its emissions of other substances, such as nitrogen and sulfur oxides. In short, decarbonization will lessen Uniper’s environmental impact overall.

Helping to reduce marine plastic litter Microplastics from waste end up in inland water bodies and the ocean, where they can be ingested by aquatic and marine animals and thus enter the food chain. Maasvlakte, a Uniper power station in Rotterdam’s harbor district that uses seawater for cooling, is participating in a three-year, EU-funded project called InNoPlastic. Its aim is to develop innovative technologies that capture nano-, micro-, and macro plastics in water and thus help the EU achieve a circular economy. Maasvlakte’s role is to collect samples of ocean water and sediment to determine what types of plastic they contain. Maasvlakte purchased a freeze-dry machine in 2021 to improve its ability to analyze samples. The project will continue in 2022.

BREF: reducing the emissions of fossil- fueled power plants. 
GRI 103-2/3 The requirements of the Industrial Emissions Best Available Techniques Reference (BREF) document for combustion plants came into force in August 2021. The BREF sets stricter emissions standards that conventional power plants have to meet unless they obtain a formal exemption. Uniper made improvements at several assets in 2021 to meet various BAT requirements and to further reduce its emissions to air, land, and water. For example, we upgraded the combustion system at Kirchmöser, a 160 MW gas-fired plant in eastern Germany, to reduce its NOx emissions. Thanks to successful trials conducted in 2020, new and highly effective mercury-abatement technology has been in operation at Scholven, a 690 MW coal-fired plant in west- central Germany, since the start of 2021. The technology keeps Scholven’s mercury emissions well below the new legal limits. Although the Scholven site is being converted to gas, it is important for its coal-fired units to meet all emissions limits before being closed down at the end of 2022. In addition, we improved the water treatment equipment at Karlshamn, a 662 MW fossil-fueled plant in southeast Sweden, to reduce wastewater emissions from its flue gas desulfurization (FGD) process.

GRI 103-1/2/3 G4-EU11 Implementing technical upgrades, improving our production processes, and pursuing operational excellence raises our power plants’ efficiency. Improving energy efficiency enables us to conserve energy, make more efficient use of the fuels we burn, and reduce our emissions. We also offer individually tailored solutions that help other industrial enterprises become more energy-efficient and thus less carbon intensive.
All of Uniper’s fossil-fueled power plants and energy storage facilities in Germany have energy management systems in place. These systems meet the standards required to achieve certification to ISO 50001, an internationally recognized standard for energy management. All of these facilities retained their certification to ISO 50001 in 2021.
Flexible, efficient power plants. 
GRI 102-3 Our aim is always to derive as much energy as possible from each unit of fuel. This reduces our environmental footprint and costs. The improvement process is ongoing. Each year, we invest to upgrade the technology in a number of our power plants and to increase their efficiency, flexibility, and availability. By systematically assessing how our plants use energy in various operational modes and in response to market requirements, we identify potential savings. The focus is on making the power production process as efficient as possible and on reducing auxiliary power consumption, especially when a plant is in reserve mode or at a standstill.
Energy efficiency. 
Case study: High-efficiency upgrade in England. 
GRI 302-4/5 Enfield, our 442 MW CCGT located in Brimsdown around 20 kilometers north of central London, received a state-of-the-art upgrade. The improvement, which became operational in mid-2021, enables Enfield to consume less fuel to produce more power by installing the most advanced efficiency upgrade from GE. It is the world’s first GE turbine of its type to achieve a fuel efficiency of nearly 60%. This reduces its carbon emissions by about 5%.
Case study: Efficiency improvements in Hungary. 
GRI 302-4/5 We carried out one such project at Gönyü, our 428 MW CCGT in northwest Hungary. Its aim was to improve the turbine’s efficiency in different operating modes, especially partial load, which is a frequent mode for Gönyü. The project achieved efficiency gains of up to 1.2%. This may sound small, but it would reduce Gönyü’s annual carbon emissions by about 7,600 metric tons. We are assessing whether the solution could be used at other Uniper CCGTs.

GRI 103-1, 303-1 Water is crucial to our business. Our hydroelectric stations are situated on numerous large and small bodies of water in Germany and Sweden. To produce power, they need sufficient water flow in rivers or sufficient water levels in reservoirs. Our thermal power stations draw cooling water from the sea, estuaries, and rivers. As we develop our business in parts of the world where water scarcity is a more urgent issue, we must be particularly vigilant.
GRI 103-2/3 We are committed to using water responsibly. We do this by complying with all applicable laws, regulations, and permit conditions, by managing our assets carefully, and by utilizing internal controls designed to minimize water-related risks. In the decades ahead, climate change is likely to change weather patterns, which will affect the hydrological cycle in the regions where we operate hydropower plants. For example, long droughts would alter river flow and reduce the amount of water available for these plants. Water stress is also likely to affect the amount of cooling water available for our thermal power plants. Our challenge is to find sustainable water sources and treatment methods to ensure our plants’ future availability.
Water risks. 
GRI 103-1/2, 303-1 In periods of drought, rivers and lakes in areas of high water stress will see a decline in water levels. When water levels drop, concentrations of pollutants increase, temperatures rise, and ecosystems suffer. Alternative solutions for managing water supplies to power plants can help reduce impacts on ecosystems during periods of water stress.
In 2021, we used the World Resource Institute’s Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas to assess whether any of our thermal power plants are located in areas of possible water stress. The findings showed that a number of our plants are indeed in such areas. However, we concluded that the overall risk for our operations is not significant. For the few plants located in areas of water stress, we identified the potential impact on our operations of either not being able to withdraw or discharge cooling water. We continue to monitor the situation and, where possible, will take steps to optimize our water usage.
Our normal asset-planning and risk process includes evaluating potential changes in the hydrological cycle and the implications of climate change for our assets, especially the 200 hydropower plants with a total capacity of 3.7 GW that we own and operate in Sweden and Germany. If these changes occur, discussions with regulatory agencies about adjusting our permitted operations to reflect seasonal variations may be necessary.

Total water withdrawal and discharge. 
GRI 103-3, 303-3/4 In 2021, we withdrew 10.4 billion cubic meters of water. This is an increase from 2020 (9.1 billion cubic meters). The increase is to be expected as Uniper’s power production increased from 2020 to 2021. We also carried out a review of the water data collection process in 2021, which resulted in an increase in volumes of water withdrawn and discharged being recorded.
GRI 102-12, 303-1/2 National and local legislation and good practice define the minimum requirements and standards for water use. Uniper complies with all applicable laws and regulations.

The main steps we take to improve water use. 
Case study: Operating responsibly in water- stressed areas. 
GRI 303-1 Kirchmöser, a 160 MW gas-fired plant in eastern Germany located next to Plauer See in Brandenburg, is in an area of high water stress.
Water is an essential part of the power generation processes, and cooling water makes up the largest part of this demand at Kirch möser. The power station can abstract up 750,000 m³ of cooling water from Plauer See each year. Some of this water will be returned back to the lake, however a proportion of water will evaporate during the cooling process.
Uniper has investigated a number of options for partially replacing the volume of water abstracted from Plauer See. The most ecological and economical option was found to be abstraction of groundwater from existing wells some distance away and pumping this groundwater into Heiliger See, one of the sources that feed Plauer See. With this new solution, the power station can continue to abstract cooling water from Plauer See, as long as – over the course of the year – the volumes abstracted from the lake during periods of water stress are compensated by supplies from the groundwater wells. In this way, an overall balance is achieved and the ecological condition of the lake can be maintained.
97% of the water withdrawn in 2021 was discharged back to the source.

Uniper Sustainability Report 2021. 
Circular economy. 
GRI 103-1 We are committed to using natural resources efficiently and responsibly. We also strive to market the by-products of power generation, which replace virgin materials and thus conserve resources. Our ability to deliver on this commitment affects our operating efficiency, margins, market position, and reputation, as well as the communities near our assets.
From fuel to building material. 
GRI 306-2 The generation of electricity at coal-fired power plants also yields by-products. These by-products have beneficial uses and can replace virgin materials in several applications and industries, such as construction. To do so, they first have to meet certain standards, such as EN 4501:2012 for the use of fly ash in the manufacture of concrete products. Using fly ash in this application is good for the environment. The use of high-quality fly ash displaces the use of cement in concrete, thereby reducing the environmental impacts associated with cement. It also prevents the fly ash from being landfilled. BauMineral, our Herten-based building materials specialist, not only maximizes the marketing of our by-products, but it also helps its customers to maximize their own reuse.
The coal phase out in Europe is taking us a step closer to decarbonization, however these closures will significantly reduce the amount of coal fly ash available for building materials. Low-carbon alternatives to fly ash are currently not available in sufficient quantity or quality. Our BauMineral subsidiary is working to find such solutions so the coal phase out does not increase other industries’ carbon emissions.
By-products production at Uniper. 
GRI 306-4/5 We sold, recovered, or disposed of 1.58 million metric tons of pulverized fly ash furnace bottom ash, and gypsum in 2021. More than 89% was recovered or sold.

GRI 103-1 We are committed to minimizing the waste we generate and improving how our waste is managed.
GRI 103-2/3, 306-1/2/3/4/5 One way we reduce our impact on the environment is by avoiding waste or reusing it. Waste results from our operations and from our projects, which include construction of new assets and the decommissioning of older assets. We always try to reuse and recycle as much waste as possible. But our primary objective is not to produce any waste in the first place. We produced 0.158 million metric tons of operational waste in 2021. This is a 8,117 metric ton reduction from 2020.
Managing radioactive waste in Sweden. 
GRI 306-1/2 We operate, or have stakes in, nuclear power plants (NPPs) in Sweden that produce low-, intermediate-, and high-level radioactive waste. We have an important responsibility to ensure that this waste is handled, stored, and disposed of properly. That is why safety, as well as radiation and environmental protection, are high priorities for us.
Uniper and the minority shareholders have designed a long-term strategy for dismantling Barsebäck NPPs two units and units 1 and 2 at Oskarshamn. Decommissioning is under way at all four units. This will lead to an increase in all levels of radioactive waste in the years ahead. Nuclear waste is managed in accordance with Swedish law. Nuclear power companies in Sweden established the Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Management Company (SKB) in the 1970s. SKB’s mission is to manage and dispose of all radioactive waste from Swedish NPPs to ensure maximum safety for people and the planet.

Case study: Recycling waste at Barsebäck. 
GRI 306-1/2/3 Barsebäck NPP, located about 20 kilometers north of Malmö on Sweden’s southwest coast, was built 50 years ago. Unit 1 operated from 1975 to 1999, Unit 2 from 1977 to 2005. The authorities granted permission to begin dismantling in 2020. Accurate classification of material, which determines which items have radiation levels low enough to be safely recycled or landfilled, is crucial. The majority of Barsebäck’s materials are in this category. Materials slightly above this level are sent to a treatment facility to decontaminate them for subsequent recycling. Materials with higher levels of radioactivity are sent to an interim storage facility until the final repository is ready for them.
2021 is the first time since the construction of the plant that a barge has been able to dock in Barsebäck’s harbor. Transport by barge has enabled some of the large metal parts of the NPP to be sent for recycling. In 2021 Barsebäck sent approximately 36 metric tons of metal scraps and electronic devices and 1,115 metric tons of large components by barge to be recycled. This included the two generator stators from the NPP turbines which weigh 270 metric tons each, and consist of iron, copper, and other metal scrap.
Our objective is to recycle as much waste as possible and to safely minimize radioactive waste, including that destined for the final repository. Recycling reduces Barsebäck’s life cycle environmental impact and promotes a circular economy.

GRI 103-1 We recognize that our operations have the potential to impact biodiversity, directly and indirectly. We therefore strive to minimize these risks by complying with applicable laws and regulations and by managing our assets carefully. We also work with relevant government agencies and with nature-conservation organizations to promote biodiversity at and near our assets.
GRI 103-2/3 As part of obtaining permission to build and operate a power plant or other industrial asset, we compile biodiversity data about the site and surrounding areas, assess the asset’s potential impacts, and put in place management controls to minimize these impacts. This process often involves consultations with conservation agencies. Throughout an asset’s operating life, we monitor the controls’ effectiveness. In addition, we protect and, if possible, enhance the ecological value of the land and water around our assets and educate our staff and contractors on the importance of protecting biodiversity.
We are committed to enhancing the biodiversity of our operations and new developments. In order to support this commitment, Uniper and its main shareholder, Fortum, set a target in 2021; to conduct at least 12 major voluntary measures that enhance biodiversity and thus contribute to UN Sustainable Development Goal 15, Life on Land. Uniper contributed five major voluntary initiatives to the two companies’ total of 13. All five are at our hydropower business in Sweden and Germany and are described below.

GRI 304-1/2/3 The spawning grounds of the European eel are believed to be in the Sargasso Sea in the western Atlantic Ocean. The Gulf Stream propels hatched larvae back toward Europe’s coasts. The spawning journey of some European eels begins in the Main, on which Uniper operates several hydropower plants. We invest about €80,000 annually to pay eel fishers to transport their catch to the Rhine, from which eels have a comparatively safe route to the open sea. This measure alone, which is conducted in cooperation with a fisheries association and the relevant Bavarian state ministry, enables about 6,600 kilograms of eels to enter the Rhine each year. In addition, three of our plants on the Main are testing safe- passage technology, such as the zigzag tube. During the migration season, the plants operate in eel-safe mode. The eel indicating “alarm” can be triggered either by the local eel fishermen or by the well- established early warning system Migromat®, which analyses the migration behavior of the eels in a bypass basin.

Located at the Lech River about 70 kilometers southwest of Munich, the two plants are connected by the Litzau Loop, one of the river’s last natural free- flowing stretches. This segment, which is about 15 kilometers long, is a species-rich nature reserve. In collaboration with the local water management authority, we are creating habitats and spawning grounds for a variety of fish, including Danube salmon, nase, and barbel. In 2021, we relocated the mouth of a stream into the river Lech to enable many aquatic species to find the stream again and to pass through it. This creates spawning grounds and habitats for juvenile fish.

More than 8,000 juvenile pike were released into the river in mid-2021 to bolster the population, which has been declining in recent years. Unipro released juvenile fish as well. Berezovskaya GRES released about 3,000 juvenile sturgeon into the Yenisei River, and Shaturskaya GRES released about 1,000 juvenile silver carp into Lake Svyatoye.

Fast lanes for fish. 
GRI 304-1/2/3 For fish, a hydroelectric plant is often an insurmountable obstacle in the river. Many of our run-of-river hydro plants in Germany already meet the requirements of the EU-WFD for the restoration of river continuity and offer fish an alternate route: a man-made creek, called a fish pass or fish ladder, enabling fish and other aquatic species to get around the power plant safely.
In 2021 Uniper constructed a further three fish ladders at the power plants Prittriching (finalization of the outdoor works in 2022), Scheuring, and Schwabstadl. Fish can once again migrate along a further 20 km of the Lech from Kaufering to Merching. This completes a valuable connection to the river downstream of Landsberg, which is already rated as ecologically good.
In Sweden, river continuity is already in place in some of our hydropower plants. Uniper is now working in accordance with the national plan for hydropower approved by the Swedish government, and in the future will be applying for new environmental permits which will determine further environmental measures required at our hydropower plants in Sweden.
Studying the effects of climate change. 
GRI 304-1 The potential implications of global warming on Baltic Sea ecosystems are unclear. Oskarshamn, the NPP we operate on Sweden’s southeast coast, is collaborating on a research project to find out more. In partnership with Linnæus University, which is located about 20 kilometers inland of Oskarshamn, we are studying communities of bacteria and plankton in bays near our power plant that have gradually become warmer over the past decades. The source of the warmth is water discharged from the plant. This creates a model system for studying future climate change in the Baltic Sea.

In addition, several species of trees (including flowering ash, chestnut, walnut, and lime) were planted on 2.3 hectares, creating a habitat for a wide variety of flora and fauna. A wildflower meadow was created around the trees to attract insects, like the bees from the eight hive boxes placed there in 2020 by an employee who is a beekeeper.

Uniper Sustainability Report 2021 100% of our operational facilities maintained their ISO 14001 certification in 2021. 
GRI 103-1 It is of strategic importance to Uniper to be fully aware of the environmental impact and performance of its operations. The environmental performance of its assets significantly affects its operating efficiency, market position, and reputation. Uniper complies with all applicable laws to prevent uncontrolled emissions to the air, water, and soil. To mitigate environmental risks, the HSSE & Sustainability function at Uniper Group Management defines and implements environmental management systems (EMS).
GRI 103-2/3 In order to minimize environmental risks, we have environmental management systems in place that are certified according to ISO 14001, an internationally recognized standard. As of yearend 2021, 100% of the existing operational assets of Uniper’s fully consolidated subsidiaries had retained their ISO 14001 certifications.
We believe that having our industrial facilities certified to ISO 14001 enhances our ability to prevent incidents that could have adverse impacts on the environment. We are therefore committed to maintaining 100% ISO 14001 certification.
Uniper’s environmental management systems include a commitment to continual improvement. All Uniper sites accredited to ISO 14001 have environmental improvement programs that describe their intended improvements and the steps toward achieving them. When practicable and useful, we coordinate improvement programs across our operations in Europe to ensure a consistent approach and share best practices.
We carefully investigate all incidents and all significant environmental close calls, taking appropriate steps to prevent them from recurring. We also systematically share knowledge about previous incidents – at our Company and across the industry – so that they are not repeated. In 2021, we had no severe environmental incidents, which we define as “the release of a substance to the soil, water, or air that would result in a longterm or irreversible change in the biological or physical environment or an extensive loss of habitats or species.”
Continually improving our environmental performance. 
Case study: CDCPK reduces its carbon emissions. 
GRI 305-5 Cottam Development Centre, Pipelines and Killingholme (CDCPK) is a Uniper asset cluster in north-central England. It consists of Cottam Development Centre (CDC), a 450 MW gas-fired power plant in Retford; Killingholme, a 600 MW gas-fired plant located northeast of CDC; and our Pipelines business, which operates 79 kilometers of natural gas pipelines in the area. One element of CDCPK’s 2021 environmental improvement program was to quantify on-site carbon emissions from sources other than the main power generation unit and to find ways to reduce them. Improvements in 2021 included: • Installation of 23 KW of solar panels at Pipelines’ office to provide renewable heat, electricity, and hot water • Preservation of CDC’s heat-recovery steam generator when the plant is offline • Commencing a project to substantially reduce the amount of electricity that Killingholme imports when offline. 
Together, these solutions will reduce CDCPK’s annual carbon emissions by more than 1,500 metric tons. More improvements are still in progress.

The Hague, the Netherlands Following a lawsuit filed by an environmental advocacy group, the legislation introduced by the Dutch government to protect Natura 2000 nature conservancies from nitrogen pollution was annulled in 2019. This nullified all applications and decisions based on this legislation. Uniper’s combined-cycle gas turbine (CCGT) in the Hague therefore had to apply for a new revised permit in 2021. Uniper provided the municipal authority with relevant information to support the application and to respond to comments submitted by third parties regarding the proposed permit. A draft permit was published in March 2021, and the municipal authority received no objections to it during the consultation period. The CCGT now operates under the revised permit, which provides the CCGT with greater operational flexibility and protects Natura 2000 areas.
Leiden, the Netherlands The municipal authority issued a new environmental permit for Uniper’s combined heat and power (CHP) plant in Leiden in 2021. The new permit had much lower NOx emission limits than had been requested by Uniper and so an appeal was filed. The appeal was rejected following a court case held in October 2021. Uniper was given one year to demonstrate whether the plant can comply with the new emissions limits.
Maasvlakte, the Netherlands Direct-Fired Boiler #2 (DBF2), a CHP plant at Uniper’s Maasvlakte power station in Rotterdam’s harbor district, is fueled by a mixture of process gases, natural gas, and waste fuels. In July 2020 Uniper received an updated permit for DBF2 but did not agree with the permit’s NOx emissions limits and therefore filed an appeal. At the time of this report’s publication, the court was still considering the appeal.
Datteln, Germany Datteln 4, Uniper’s 1.1 GW hard-coal-fired power plant in west-central Germany, began commercial operation in May 2020. In August 2021 the Higher Administrative Court of North Rhine-Westphalia (OVG NRW) in Münster heard lawsuits brought by the City of Waltrop (a town near Datteln), BUND NRW e.V. (an environmental advocacy group), and four private individuals. The lawsuits contested the city of Datteln’s development plan from 2014, which constitutes the basis for the permit. As a result of the hearing in August, the OVG NRW ruled in favor of the plaintiffs and declared the development plan invalid and did not allow for an appeal. This decision is not final. Both Uniper as a joined party and the City of Datteln as defendant have filed complaints against the non-admission of the appeal.

GRI 103-1 Uniper’s strategy has three interrelated components: decarbonization, customer centricity, and security of supply. A secure and reliable supply of energy is essential for the functioning of society and a competitive economy. Our priority is to provide a secure, affordable, and diversified supply of power, gas, and heat to our customers, while simultaneously making this energy progressively climate-friendlier and in the long term climate-neutral.
How we manage our generation fleet. 
GRI 103-2/3,G4-EU10 We own and operate 33.2 GW of generating capacity. This fleet is highly efficient, flexible, and diversified. Many of our power plants ensure a reliable supply by balancing out the fluctuations in wind and solar power to keep the grid stable. Grid operators have awarded contracts to Uniper to continue operating power plants as reserve plants, some of which were originally scheduled for closure as part of our decarbonization strategy. For example, Heyden 4, Uniper’s 875 MW coal-fired plant in northwest Germany, was due to be decommissioned in mid-2021. The grid operator, however, considers Heyden 4 essential, and it will therefore remain in operation as a reserve power plant until September 2022 to help keep the power system reliable.
In addition to producing electricity and providing stability to the grid, many of our plants supply heat, process steam, compressed air, and other products to nearby industrial enterprises and utilize some of these enterprises’ waste streams.
We periodically upgrade the technology and processes at our assets so that we continue to ensure high rates of availability and efficiency and prevent unplanned downtime. Some of these upgrades also improve our assets’ climate performance.

Wilhelmshaven coal power plant - future plans for green energy hub and LNG terminal. 
Uniper Sustainability Report 2021. 
Securing and diversifying Europe’s gas supply Uniper sources gas from various producers in several countries including Russia, Azerbaijan, Norway and the Netherlands. Uniper’s long-term import contracts with Russia play an essential role for the gas supply in Europe, especially in Germany. Uniper's gas midstream business comprises a portfolio of around 370 TWh of longterm gas supply contracts: Of these, about 200 TWh originate from Russia. Uniper sees it as its mission to do everything in its means to supply people in Germany and Europe with energy. Uniper will continue to be reliable in fulfilling this task on the basis of the existing contracts, however will not enter into any new long-term supply contracts for natural gas with Russia.
To diversify its gas supply, Uniper will expand its LNG business. Over the years the long-term capacity at the Isle of Grain and Gate terminals have been increased in order to import LNG into Europe. For the diversification of the German portfolio, Uniper has resumed its plans for an LNG terminal in Wilhelmshaven in Northern Germany. These activities will be closely linked to the plans to make Wilhelmshaven a green energy hub, with green ammonia import and hydrogen production to fulfill more than 10% of the German hydrogen demand in 2030.
In late 2020 Uniper began procuring gas from Azerbaijan. Under a long-term contract concluded in 2013 with Baku-based SOCAR (State Oil Company of the Azerbaijan Republic), Uniper will source up to 1.5 billion cubic meters (bcm) of natural gas per year via the Southern Gas Corridor (SGC). The SGC is a system of pipelines that connects the Caspian region and the Middle East to Southeastern Europe. The contract runs until 2045.

We are examining how to make our storage facilities hydrogen-ready. Hydrogen, like natural gas, can be stored underground. Large-scale underground hydrogen storage will be essential for Europe’s hydrogen market and will help improve its economic viability. The development of new underground hydrogen storage facilities and the conversion of gas facilities to hydrogen require a reliable regulatory framework.
How gas storage supports security of supply In addition to the diversification of our gas procurement sources, we are operating our gas storage facilities responsibly. Gas consumption is subject to large seasonal fluctuations between summer and winter as well as short-term changes in demand, particularly in winter. Uniper’s underground gas storage facilities help balance these differences. Uniper is Europe’s fourth-largest gas storage company. We have 7.4 bcm of underground gas storage capacity in Germany, Austria, and the United Kingdom.
Our underground gas storage facilities in the form of caverns or porous rock formations enable us to ensure a secure and flexible gas supply to consumers in times of fluctuating seasonal demand, e.g. for heating our homes, or during demand peaks or import interruptions.

Investing in Hydropower Hydroelectric plants provide a highly reliable, zero-carbon source of baseload electricity. But they can do more. In Sweden, for example, the ongoing addition of intermittent wind power poses challenges for Svenska Kraftnät, the country’s transmission system operator (TSO). One of these challenges is maintaining constant frequency. To address it, Svenska Kraftnät asked generators to submit bids to provide fast frequency reserve (FFR). This, as the name suggests, is generating capacity that can come online at short notice to support frequency (by producing power) or reduce excess frequency (by absorbing power).
In mid-2020 Svenska Kraftnät selected two Uniper hydroelectric plants in northern Sweden, Edsele (6 MW) and Lövön (9 MW), to provide FFR. Both are embankment hydro plants that are now equipped with batteries. The plants’ reservoirs store energy to address larger imbalances in the grid, whereas the batteries provide FFR. The combination of reservoir and batteries enable the plants to do a wider range of jobs for the TSO. The batteries became operational in early 2021. Two more battery systems will be installed at Bodum and Fjällsjö hydro plants in Sweden, which have a combined capacity of around 12 MW. These systems make Uniper a leading player in innovative hybrid systems for supply security.
As weather-dependent electricity production is expanded, the need to utilize hydropower's regulatory capacity also increases. With our battery system in Sweden, we can make better use of the flexibility of hydropower and thus increase the stability of the electricity system.

GRI 103-1/2 Human rights violations shall not be tolerated in any part of our business or anywhere along our supply chain. Uniper does business around the world, including in countries whose institutions are not always fully able to protect all internationally recognized human rights.
GRI 102-12, 103-2 Respect for human rights is embedded into our business policies and procedures. This minimizes and, ideally, prevents the risk of contributing to or benefiting from human rights issues in our operations and along our value chain. Ensuring compliance with applicable laws on this matter requires continuous efforts and ability to adapt our business. Key legal frameworks are the UK Modern Slavery Act introduced in 2015 and the Act on Corporate Due Diligence Obligations in Supply Chains, which was adopted by the German parliament in July 2021. In addition, we aim to act in accordance with international standards, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the United Nations (UN) Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, and the standards of the International Labour Organization (ILO).
Severe human rights violations such as unlawful forced displacements or forced labor can be a direct or indirect consequence of business activities, particularly in countries with a history of insufficient standards for security, social development, and inclusion. Moreover, factors such as authoritarian governments, weak democratic institutions, and a widespread lack of transparency and accountability in some of these countries pose significant challenges to effective operations and supply chain management.
GRI 103-2/3 Uniper is committed to screening its operations and suppliers for ESG risks, including human rights risks. In September 2021 we began a project to centrally coordinate human right due diligence processes and enhance risk assessments. It brings together experts from Sustainability, Compliance, Procurement, and other business functions potentially exposed to human rights risks, such as our coal. 
Human rights and gas trading teams. A key task is to build on existing processes, such as the ESG Due Diligence on counterparties and expand the scope of our assessments. The initial analysis indicated that risk assessments need to be more granular in order to identify which individual activities, projects, purchased products and services pose actual human rights risks. Timely and effective remediation measures for identified risks are an important aspect of the process. The project team will propose improvements for these and other processes as its work continues in 2022.
To further strengthen our commitment, we set ourselves a new target in 2022 as part of the revised SSP: Uniper aims to become actively involved in up to three multistakeholder associations by 2023 that support ESG due diligence along the supply chain for Uniper’s energy commodities.
Uniper engages with its suppliers – both directly and in collaboration with non-governmental organizations and multistakeholder initiatives – in order to identify and mitigate adverse impacts on ESG issues, including human rights risks. Our engagement activities continued in 2021.
100% of our counterparties will be assessed under our ESG due diligence process by year-end 2022.

Coal supply chain issues and our Bettercoal engagement. 
GRI 102-12/43, 412-3, 414-1/2 In order to establish adequate measures to prevent, monitor, and mitigate human rights risks in the coal supply chain, we participate in Bettercoal, a not-for-profit initiative established by a group of major European utilities committed to a more responsible coal supply chain.
Bettercoal’s assurance system is centered around a supplier assessment process: Bettercoal independently assesses coal mining operations’ performance against the 12 principles of the Bettercoal Code 2.0. The code consists of a balanced set of ESG aspects, including detailed provisions for human rights due diligence in conflict-affected areas. In response to the assessments, coal mining companies design continuous improvement plans, which are integral to Uniper’s due diligence and ESG risk management.
We track the proportion of coal we purchase under direct contracts from Bettercoal suppliers. In 2021, 71% of our directly purchased coal came from Bettercoal suppliers compared with 68% in 2020 (2019: 55%). Bettercoal has a country-prioritization strategy. In 2018 it therefore established working groups for Russia and Colombia. Their purpose is to better coordinate the monitoring of suppliers’ continuous improvement plans and to facilitate dialogue between Bettercoal and relevant stakeholders. Uniper is chair of the Bettercoal Colombia working group and member of the Russia working group. Since Uniper’s procurement of coal from Russia will cease after 2022, the future of Uniper’s membership in the Russian working group is uncertain.
E Stakeholder engagement chapter. 
In line with our plan to expand our diversified gas business and progressively decarbonize it, we began to conduct ESG due diligence of individual projects and deals. We believe that working with strategic gas suppliers to mitigate ESG risks along the value chain can have significant positive impacts for communities involved and for the planet as a whole. Since 2020, we have been focusing on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions transparency, including methane monitoring, as the most material issue to address.
Procurement of other goods and services. 
GRI 103-2/3, 412-3, 414-2 Uniper does business with thousands of suppliers every year. The selection of suppliers, contractors, and products is therefore a crucial step in the identification and prevention of human rights risks. Since 2016 Uniper expects its suppliers to comply with its Supplier Code of Conduct. In 2021 we introduced a spreadsheet tool to identify additional sustainability criteria, for example those related to the UN Sustainable Development Goals, for various product categories. Considering all tenders done in 2021, 13% included Sustainability Criteria. For 2022, the goal is to apply the Sustainability Criteria to 20% of all tenders. Germany’s Act on Corporate Due Diligence Obligations in Supply Chains takes effect on January 1, 2023. This will ensure that our compliance will involve further improving our ability to identify products and service providers that might pose human rights risks, particularly in activities where service outsourcing is a common practice.

We commit to a just transition of our operations and sites through effective dialogue and stakeholder engagement to support our people and communities affected by transition; to develop sustainable economic strategies for our sites and to foster diverse, inclusive, and decent work.
Quitting coal, ensuring a just transition A key facet of Uniper’s decarbonization plan is exiting coal in Europe. We have designed master plans for all coal sites scheduled for closure to ensure that they have a viable future in a greener energy world. We will, for example, convert the Scholven power station site in west-central Germany to gas, meaning that two high-efficiency gas turbines will replace the existing coal-fired plant. The site will also become an innovation hub for hydrogen technology: the name of the project – H2iRTC – stands for the "Hydrogen Industrial Research and Training Center." The center will be specifically designed to address industry needs and will also create and safeguard jobs. We are exploring a variety of opportunities for other sites. For example, we intend to transform Wilhelmshaven power plant on Germany’s North Sea coast, which closed at the end of 2021, into a green hydrogen hub that by 2030 can meet 15% of the country’s hydrogen needs.
The decreasing demand and production of coal may have significant implications for employment, public revenues, and the local economy in coal mining regions. Uniper therefore supports Bettercoal’s economic diversification project in Cesar, a mining region in Colombia. Project partners include CNV International (a confederation of Dutch. 
Phasing out of coal is a driving issue and a huge challenge in the UK, the Netherlands, and Germany. At Uniper, we do not want to wait until the time has come and the plants have been decommissioned. Instead, we want to actively develop sites in advance and involve the responsible parties in the cities and communities in the process. Our aim is to create opportunities and secure or expand our own business and current jobs in the long term.
An example of a successful revitalization projects is at Ironbridge in the UK. The site was sold to an investor aiming at regenerating the old power station site for the creation of a new quarter with housing modern employment space. Our vision proposes a mixture of commercial, manufacturing, and industrial spaces, along with the potential for storage, distribution, and data center uses; all of which would deliver new job opportunities and attract longterm investment into the region. Decarbonizing our business goes hand in hand with a just transition of our operations. I am excited for the developments ahead!”

Thanks to training and active communications that helped our staff become more familiar with the tool, the quality of reporting and incident management have improved since the tool’s introduction in 2018.

Uniper Sustainability Report 2021. 
GRI 403-3/6 Covid-19 continued to have a very significant impact on Uniper’s health and safety agenda and was one of our biggest challenges in 2021. Uniper’s top priority amid the ongoing crisis was to protect employees, contractors, and suppliers at all times while maintaining business continuity. Given this extraordinary situation, Uniper was committed to its role in containing the pandemic and mitigating negative consequences throughout its global business. Germany was the only European country where the Company had the chance to support the national vaccination campaign by conducting a vaccination program for employees. The inclusion of occupational medical services in the national vaccination plan enabled Uniper to offer all employees in Germany the opportunity to be vaccinated. Vaccination centers were established at Uniper’s Düsseldorf headquarters and 12 locations in the Ruhr area. Effective coordination and teamwork made it possible to give more than 1,300 people a Covid-19 vaccination from June to August 2021. Where sufficient vaccine was available, vaccinations were also offered to family members and contractors. In Russia, vaccinations were offered in the medical centers on-site.
The Covid-19 coordination team formed in February 2020 continued to be the central steering group for Uniper’s actions to manage the pandemic in 2021. In 2021 most non-operational employees again chose to work from home to minimize the risk of work-related infections. We focused on the best available solutions to make remote working as comfortable as possible for our employees. Whenever possible, we supported employees’ individual preferences to work from home, at the office, or a hybrid arrangement. When the pandemic situation became safer, we invited employees in all countries to return to the office, which gave them the opportunity to interact face-to-face again and reconnect. We took comprehensive steps to.

When the situation worsened in Germany in November 2021, we asked employees to again work from home, if possible. Uniper’s NewNormal project defined future approaches to working in a post-pandemic world. It included support to make home offices ergonomic for employees who regularly work from home. We help by systematically assessing home offices and, if necessary, offering additional equipment so employees can work from home.
Gönyü: enhanced Covid-19 safety measures and virtual safety walk Gönyü, our 428 MW combined-cycle gas turbine in northwest Hungary, received an efficiency upgrade in 2021 that will reduce its carbon emissions. Many more people were on site for this work than during usual operations, so we enhanced our Covid-19 safety measures accordingly, such as introducing a testing requirement.
In addition, we conducted a virtual safety walk involving about 25 Uniper employees and managers as well as engineers from Siemens, the turbine’s manufacturer. Virtual presence technology and sophisticated digital tools made it possible to identify good safety practices as well as areas for improvement. Virtual safety walks and talks were also conducted at other Uniper sites in 2021.
I’m very excited that our occupational health service providers could start giving vaccinations in early June 2021 to support our fight against the pandemic. When it was my turn, I received my first vaccination in our vaccination center in Düsseldorf. The process was very smooth and efficient. Heike Bussmann, Senior Vice President HSSE Systems & Solutions.

Focus on a healthy Uniper. 
GRI 103-2/3, 403-3/6 In general, health management continued to make progress in 2021. For the second time since 2018, Uniper won the Corporate Health Award from EUPD Research and the Handelsblatt Media Group in the “Energy Industry” category. The award is Germany’s best-known in the field of occupational health management. Uniper’s integrated health approach offers all employees access to a wide range of services, from medical checkups and extensive exercise programs to mental well-being campaigns. In addition, the business functions continued to implement the steps defined in their health action plans. Their progress toward completing these steps was reported to the Uniper Board of Management and senior leaders on a quarterly basis.
The 2021 Voice of Uniper survey (which does not include our business in Russia) indicated high satisfaction with Uniper’s health culture. The average score on the health-related questions remained stable at 89% positive in 2021, the same as in 2020. The only small decrease (–2 percentage points) was in the feedback relating to mental health, specifically the ability to cope with mental demands amid the ongoing pandemic. This may have been related to the extended periods of remote work that many employees experienced and the general stress of the pandemic.
How we strive to improve health and safety. 
GRI 103-2/3, 403-9 We use combined total recordable incident frequency (TRIF) as a safety metric alongside the degree of implementation of our HSSE & Sustainability Improvement Plans. Combined TRIF measures the number of work-related accidents sustained by our employees and contractors per million hours of work. In 2020, Uniper set a threshold of 1.3 for combined TRIF through year-end 2021. In 2020, we committed to striving even further by reducing our combined TRIF threshold to 1.0 by year-end 2025. We intend to get there by providing training, fostering continual learning, and further improving our management systems.
As part of the NewNormal project, trainees developed the NewNorman, a small sideboard when folded, and an ergonomic desk when unfolded. The desk is space-saving, height-adjustable, and movable on casters. It provides easy cable management and storage space for IT equipment, stationery, and documents. This elegant solution makes it possible to work in a small living space, but also meets Uniper’s standards for ergonomics and safety. Its design drew on input from many employees across Uniper who work remotely, and is a good example of innovation through collaboration. Uniper’s care for its employees extends to all work arrangements so that we can ensure that health and safety standards are met regardless of the type of work environment.
The NewNorman: an elegant solution that makes it possible to work even in a small living space, but that also meets Uniper’s standards for ergonomics and safety.

Our operating assets faced different challenges in the pandemic’s second year. Existing preventive measures (socially distancing masks, and hand hygiene) continued and, where necessary, some new measures (such as rapid tests) were added. Reporting and tracking of confirmed cases and quarantines gave us a detailed picture of how emerging infection trends affected countries and facilities. We carefully investigated transmission instances to ensure lessons were learned.
Barsebäck: learning from an outbreak On a single day in November 2021, 32 people working at Barsebäck, a decommissioning Uniper nuclear power station in Sweden, caught Covid-19. Within five days, more than 60 people were infected. A pandemic response team was swiftly formed, which dealt with contact tracing, informing the regional authorities, and ultimately suspending work in the affected areas for six days. Thankfully, none of those infected became seriously ill. We learned a number of lessons from the outbreak. Firstly, people who need to work together closely can communicate by radio using a mic and earbuds. Secondly, we need to ensure that contractors are fully aware of our pandemic management policies and need to safeguard business continuity. Thirdly, PCR tests may need to replace self-tests in certain situations because of their greater accuracy. Finally, our risk assessments now consider not only the pandemic situation at Barsebäck, but also in the regions where our contractors come from.

Uniper Sustainability Report 2021 1.51 Combined TRIF Combined TRIF, which includes the safety performance of contractor employees, was 1.51 in 2021 (2020: 1.17), above our 2021 threshold of 1.3. This was mainly due to a significant increase in reportable accidents in the gas turbine and nuclear fleets as well as the storage business, and could not be offset by a decrease in accidents in the hydroelectric fleet and operations in Russia. Uniper started fleet-specific and Uniper-wide safety improvement programs that aim to reverse this negative trend in 2022. On balance, combined TRIF increased by 29%. 0.82 Employee TRIF TRIF for Uniper employees declined to 0.82 in 2021 (2020: 0.90). Employee TRIF at our subsidiary in Russia improved again in 2021 and was lower than that of any other unit. This, along with a significantly lower TRIF at our hydroelectric fleet, was responsible for the decrease. 2.55 Contractor TRIF Contractor TRIF increased significantly to 2.55 (2020: 1.51), mainly because of more reportable incidents in the gas turbine fleet, the storage business, and Engineering. Another likely reason was the easing of pandemic-related restrictions in 2021 as well as more maintenance outages than in 2020, which led to more people being at a facility than during normal operations. Covid-19-related uncertainties may also have had a negative influence on contractors’ safety performance. Uniper’s systematic contractor management and engagement initiatives did not have the same positive impact as in 2020. We will therefore continue supporting our operating business in applying our standards and working to further improve our contractors’ safety performance and adherence to our standards. Engaging with contractors will be a significant focus in 2022.
We also report lost-time injury frequency (LTIF), which measures the number of lost time accidents per million hours of work. 0.99 Combined LTIF Combined LTIF increased to 0.99 (2020: 0.70). Like combined TRIF, this was mainly due to a significant increase in reportable accidents in the gas turbine and nuclear fleets as well as the storage business. 0.51 Employee LTIF Employee LTIF improved slightly to 0.51 (2020: 0.55). 1.70 Contractor LTIF Contractor LTIF almost doubled from 0.88 in 2020 to 1.70 in 2021. The reasons are the same as with contractor TRIF.
Fatal injury in Russia On February 19, 2021, an employee of a contractor company was fatally injured at a construction site on the premises of Berezovskaya power plant in Russia. According to Russian federal legal requirements, after the contract had been signed, Uniper did not have legal rights (supervisory authority) and thus could not directly control whether the contractor company respected established safety standards during the specific jobs performed in what was a restricted area. Two independent investigations were conducted: one by Russian authorities and another by a team from Unipro and Uniper. Their findings resulted in the implementation of several corrective actions to prevent recurrence. Even though Uniper did not have a legal responsibility, it included the incident in its incident reporting because it happened on Uniper property.

Becoming a learning organization. 
GRI 103-2/3 The ambitious Company-wide project to transform Uniper into a learning organization continued in 2021. The project builds on the improvement of Uniper’s processes for reporting, documenting, and analyzing incidents that took place in 2019. We identified several actions to improve organizational learning. They include improving transparency about learning progress, coordinating tools and systems for sharing good practices, sharing lessons learned with contractors and other companies, and refining learning tools, engagement, and communications channels. These actions will now be implemented by our different business areas. The project aims to build into a wider learning community in 2022 in order to firmly embed a learning mindset in the organization. A new, interactive learning platform is currently being developed to facilitate continual learning.
Uniper continues to propel its journey toward becoming a learning organization by means of leadership, passion, and the allocation of sufficient resources.

Uniper Sustainability Report 2021 52 “Beyond Zero: Better for our people, assets, and planet” is the HSSE & Sustainability 2025 vision for Uniper’s operational areas. The initiative, led by the COO, encompasses our people (their health, safety, and lifelong learning), our assets (their health, security, and integrity), and our focus on the sustainable future of energy, in partnership with customers and communities. The idea is to go beyond zero harm – the motto of our previous safety vision – to also focus on adding value for our employees, assets, and planet. Beyond Zero is the umbrella for a variety of initiatives to foster continual and innovative improvement at asset operations, but also seeks to collaborate with other projects across Uniper that accord with its vision.
Our operational business has made great strides in improving its processes as well as its people’s mindsets and options for learning. Beyond Zero has many facets but a simple message: let us build on our past improvements to make tomorrow even better than today. It is about embarking on a journey of continual improvement in line with the course set by Uniper’s purpose, Empower Energy. 
Evolution. Each asset and each colleague’s individual journey will be different, yet share the same aim: to make our worlds – work, home, and communities – better places to be. As part of Beyond Zero, Uniper’s project to transform itself into a learning organization continued in 2021. It brings together colleagues from different parts of the business to foster mutual learning through the sharing of information and best practices. The project aims to develop into a wider learning community in 2022 and thus to firmly anchor a learning mindset in the organization.

GRI 103-1 Uniper employees are key to our success. The labor market is highly competitive. This makes having a strong and attractive employer brand crucial for attracting and hiring the kind of people who can help Uniper realize its ambition to ensure a reliable energy supply while systematically decarbonizing its portfolio.
Fair and attractive employer. 
GRI 103-2 We place a significant emphasis on an open and trusting corporate culture, which we call the Uniper Way. It has three core elements and three corresponding guiding statements: leadership (grow and empower people), teamwork (become one team and simplify processes), and individual contribution (act as if it is your own company). The Uniper Way is brought to life in day-to-day interactions. Its core elements are embedded in the main components of our HR cycle: our capability-based approach, guidelines for job interviews, and systematic feedback on employees’ performance, which fosters continuous self-reflection and improvement. Supported by digitalization, these elements help create an agile and flexible organization with more cost-efficient processes.
The Voice of Uniper, our annual employee survey, measures employees’ engagement with our strategic people objectives and collects feedback that can be used to measure the achievement of the objectives. The 2021 survey, our sixth, again had a high participation rate (66%). Employees’ satisfaction with Uniper as an employer remained high. Employees particularly appreciate flexible working hours and the opportunity to work from home, which makes it easier to balance work and private life. They also praised Uniper’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic and indicated that they support its sustainability journey.
How we manage our attractiveness as an employer. 
GRI 103-2/3 Uniper’s purpose is to Empower Energy Evolution while making itself more streamlined, more competitive, and more resilient. This includes steady progress in decarbonization. Uniper has identified the critical capabilities needed to achieve its strategic objectives and anticipate changes in its competitive environment. Our HR activities help maintain and nurture them through a future-oriented, capability- based approach to hiring and developing people.
In 2021 the Nyckeltalsinstitutet AB in Sweden again named Uniper an excellent employer, meaning that Uniper is among Sweden’s top 10% of employers in terms of working conditions. The rating is based on survey data from 2020 from just over 600,000 employees of a total of 350 companies, organizations, and government agencies. In 2021 Uniper was also named one of the most attractive employers in Düsseldorf by Capital, a monthly business magazine, and Statistica, a statistics services firm. Employer awards help project and reinforce the Uniper brand. They give employees and applicants confirmation that they have chosen the right employer.
In 2021 Uniper introduced a questionnaire for job candidates to ask them for feedback on all its recruitment and hiring processes, starting with application and ending with onboarding. The aim is to make these processes even more attractive and successful for new employees.

Uniper Trainee Program. 
GRI 404-2 Our 18- to 24-month trainee program for high-potential university graduates is one of the ways we ensure we have an ample pipeline of talent. The program, which rotates trainees through several departments at our Company, is tailored to their individual interests and career plans. In 2021, 25 new trainees joined the program. After their initial placement, trainees have additional placements of their choice that can be in a different country or a different function. The program also consists of a variety of workshops, online training modules, a detailed tour of one of our power plants, and a two-week operational excellence workshop. We accept new trainees to the program twice a year in April and October. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, all hiring and onboarding processes for trainees were again conducted virtually in 2021.
Our aim is to retain all trainees who want to continue their professional journey with us. More than 95% of those who completed the program between 2016 and year-end 2021 took on a permanent role at Uniper. Reviews show that managers are very satisfied with trainees’ performance in their permanent role, and the demand for program graduates is high across the Company. In October 2021, the program celebrated its five-year anniversary. We are proud that of the inaugural class of 15 trainees from 2016, 11 are still at Uniper.
How we manage and reward our workforce. 
GRI 103-2, 401-2 Uniper offers attractive total target cash to appeal to and retain talent at all experience levels. Total target cash includes a variable component whose purpose is to incentivize teamwork and the successful implementation of Uniper’s strategy. This component reflects the Group’s performance and, in the case of specific employee groups, individual performance and behavior as well. Uniper offers benefits packages that vary by country, excellent working conditions including hybrid work arrangements, and Uniper’s unique corporate culture known as the Uniper Way. These all help our employees feel valued and included. In addition, our retirement plans help employees lay the foundation for their future financial security and that of their dependents, while at the same time fostering employee retention. We are currently adjusting our benefits portfolio to support a greener future. In some countries, Uniper now offers electric company cars or a cash allowance instead of a car. We are also exploring ways for retirement plans to include sustainability targets.
Uniper offers flexible work schedules. In Germany, for example, our works agreement states that we strive to make family and career compatible and therefore support part-time work, if operational needs permit. Parental leave is granted as prescribed by law. Flexible work arrangements, job-sharing, mobile work, and help with child-, home-, and eldercare are some of the ways we make it easier for employees to have a healthy work-life balance. Since March 2020 – shortly after Covid-19 arrived in Europe – we have actively enabled, encouraged, and supported our people to work from home whenever possible. We have also made work hours even more accommodating, vacation days more flexible, and provided virtual childcare. In addition, we have provided employees and managers with specific support and individual consulting to help them cope with the new and challenging situation created by the pandemic.
GRI 401-1 We hired 1,122 new employees from outside of our Company in 2021. The majority were recruited in Germany (47.9 %) and Russia (32 %). New employees in 2021 were onboarded through virtual events.
At year-end 2021, 5% of our permanent employees were working part-time. This is roughly the same as in 2020 (4.9%).

It provides opportunities for vocational training for a wide variety of commercial and technical occupations as well as internships that prepare interns for formal apprenticeships. We had 152 apprentices and 87 work-study students and interns at year-end 2021.
Uniper’s approach to employee development combines theoretical training with practical application, focusing on learning with and from colleagues.

Digital Skills Compass – a learning program encompassing topics like data science, industrial cybersecurity, digital business transformation, agile project management, and digital trading – continued as well. In addition, Uniper enhanced its digital learning by launching a mobile learning platform for interactive language training. We also added a new eLibrary with over 2,500 eBooks and audio learning content in several languages covering a wide range of topics to support employees’ personal development. Furthermore, Uniper launched #evolve, its first cross-functional, international program for developing high-potential employees. The program helps such employ- ees acquire the skills necessary to lead a project, be responsible for a topic and lead a team. Learning in 2021 focused on virtual collaboration and communication, well-being, the digital workplace and hybrid leadership. The aim was to prepare employees to be leaders in the NewNormal.

GRI 103-1 Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) play an important role in enhancing Uniper’s competitiveness, resilience, creativity, innovation, and enterprise value. Promoting DEI, treating them as an opportunity, and combating discrimination are all central to the Uniper Way, our corporate culture.
In 2021, Uniper broadened its understanding of DEI to include equity: providing equal opportunity and development possibilities to everyone by ensuring that processes and programs are unbiased and fair. Fairness means creating a level playing field for everyone.
Uniper seeks growth through innovation. We know from experience that teams whose members have differing perspectives and horizons of experience can develop more innovative and creative solutions than homogeneous teams. Consequently, a diverse workforce will better enable us to meet the needs of diverse stakeholders and customers and to support our strategy for international growth, decarbonization, and sustainability. For all these reasons, DEI are a top priority for Uniper.

Our management of diversity and inclusion. 
GRI 103-2/3 Uniper takes DEI seriously and wants to do even more to cultivate a workplace where everyone can thrive personally and professionally. It therefore decided in 2020 to create a full-time DEI role at Uniper. In addition, the Board of Management participated in a DEI workshop to better understand the status quo and, in 2021, decided to adopt a Company-wide DEI strategy, which was communicated in early 2022. The strategy clarifies Uniper’s DEI ambitions, creates a common framework for all DEI activities, establishes a governance structure, and enhances analytics, measurability, and transparency. It has five main action areas: talent management, leadership, organization, marketplace, and society. The DEI strategy will enable Uniper to take a comprehensive, structured approach to all relevant stakeholders, functions, processes, and policies.
GRI 102-12 Other DEI projects were launched in 2021, including a review of the process for reporting discrimination, a root-cause analysis of gender balance, inclusive recruiting, and the expansion of DEI learning offerings and training modules, which are available to all employees and leaders, excluding those in Russia.
Uniper signed the German Diversity Charter (Charta der Vielfalt), a corporate initiative to promote diversity at companies and institutions in Germany. The signing signifies our voluntary commitment to promote diversity and appreciation in our business culture. Uniper’s Board of Management is fully committed to promoting DEI in the seven dimensions defined by the Charter: gender, nationality or ethnic background, religion or worldview, disability, age or generation, sexual orientation and identity, and socioeconomic background. Uniper’s DEI ambassador network, a community of colleagues who are enthusiastic about the topic and engaging in related activities, helps reinforce awareness in their business function and across the organization.
Alongside the DEI ambassador network, our employee-led resource groups are instrumental in fostering and advocating DEI. All these groups continued their activities in 2021 using virtual means and increased their membership. The biggest, called Women at Uniper, has more than 920 members. Other groups, such as the Pride Community (our internal LGBTIQ+ network) and the Parents Network, remained active as well.

GRI 404-2 Most Uniper office staff worked from home for much of 2021 because of the ongoing pandemic. Consequently, DEI events were generally conducted virtually. International Women’s Day, Pride Day and Coming Out Day, International Men’s Day, Ramadan, and Diwali are among the awareness days that were commemorated by various events and communications at Uniper. Uniper also focused on issues like combating racism and becoming a better ally. As in prior years, individual teams and functions at Uniper addressed DEI on their own by organizing events and awareness sessions and by participating in DEI training. The biggest event was “More than Diversity,” a Company- wide three-day virtual conference held in September 2021. It consisted of presentations, panel discussions, and workshops on a wide range of DEI issues. The speakers included Board of Management members, Uniper colleagues, and outside experts. The event gave employees the opportunity to share best practices and personal experiences and to find out more about in-house DEI learning offerings.
Uniper’s target is to achieve an employee inclusion indicator of over 95% by 2022. This means that at least 95% of employees say in the annual Voice of Uniper survey (which excludes Unipro, Uniper’s subsidiary in Russia) that they feel included in their team. This indicator decreased from 89% in 2020 to 85% in 2021. The Company will therefore place greater emphasis on inclusion issues in 2022 and will maintain the target beyond 2022.
Preventing discrimination and harassment and fostering inclusion. 
GRI 102-17 Uniper has zero tolerance of any form of discrimination or harassment. Uniper complies with all antidiscrimination laws and regulations in the countries where it operates, such as the German General Equality Act. Compliance is supported by clear Company policies for addressing potential violations and the training of managers to help them recognize and prevent even the most subtle forms of harassment. In circumstances where employees feel that either they or a colleague are being harassed, they are encouraged to contact their HR department, their unit’s Compliance Officer, the Works Council, or, if they wish to remain anonymous, a whistle-blower hotline. Uniper takes violations very seriously and does everything it can to rectify the situation, including taking disciplinary action.
GRI 404-2 We provide training to our managers and executives to help them recognize and prevent even the most subtle forms of discrimination, harassment, and bias. All employees, except those in Russia, have access to an eLearning module that helps them recognize signs of unconscious bias. They can also make use of software and IT tools that promote inclusiveness in online meetings and make technology more accessible. More generally, we continually encouraged our people to expand their DEI skill set.
We actively seek to hire minorities and people with disabilities, support their professional and personal development, and promote them.
Promoting gender equality and fostering female talent. 
GRI 405-1 Uniper’s target is for women to account for 25% of the first and second management levels below the Board of Management by June 2022. At year-end 2021, 20.6% of these positions were held by women, still below target. Women made up 25.0% of our overall workforce in 2021, almost unchanged from the prior-year figure of 25.2%. We intend to increase the share of women in the workforce through more diverse selection and recruitment procedures, mentoring, flexible work arrangements for all employees, and similar measures.
We participate in a number of projects and initiatives to further enhance our commitment to equal opportunity and social responsibility as an employer. In mid-2020 Uniper joined “Komm, mach MINT,” a nationwide campaign in Germany run by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research to support women and girls in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Since then, the campaign has been used as a networking opportunity to attract future talent. Our participation is one of the ways we support women and girls in STEM and highlight career opportunities.
Another is by participating in Girls’ Day – Future Prospects for Girls, an annual initiative under the patronage of the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research. Its purpose is to give girls the opportunity to learn more about STEM careers and, ideally, spur their interest in embarking on one. The event was held virtually in April 2021.

Green Office Green Office, founded in 2018, brings together more than 400 Uniper employees dedicated to promoting sustainable behavior in their work environment and its surroundings. The initiative continued its work in 2021, despite the challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic and the fact that many office employees spent much of the year working from home. Its activities included reducing waste, encouraging better waste segregation, and finding sustainable ways to dispose of old IT devices. Green Office’s flagship project, an annual summer cleanup of the Rhine river and its banks in Düsseldorf, had the most participants yet. Over 70 Uniper employees collected bottles, bottle caps, plastic straws, cigarette butts, pieces of clothing, and much more. Altogether, they gathered more than a truckload of waste.
The Green Office community began a new initiative in 2021: the Uniper cleanup challenge. Employees were encouraged to go outside and spend ten minutes cleaning up their neighborhood. Around 600 liters of litter were collected by Uniper employees in Germany, the United Kingdom, and Sweden.

Environmental improvement campaigns in Russia Employees of Unipro, our power generation subsidiary in Russia, participated in a number of environmental improvement campaigns in 2021. One was in Shatura, a small city located about 120 kilometers east of Moscow where Unipro operates Shaturskaya GRES, a predominantly gas-fired power station. Some of its employees joined volunteers from a youth center to plant a stand of spruce, willow, wild plum, and rowan trees on the shore of a nearby lake.
World Cleanup Day is September 18. Employees from Smolenskaya GRES, a Unipro heat power plant located about 370 kilometers west of Moscow, commemorated it by helping schoolchildren clean up a local park as well as over 450 meters of shoreline at a reservoir.
Surgutskaya-2 GRES, a 5.6 GW Unipro gas-fired plant in Surgut in Western Siberia, is Russia’s third-largest. Junior staff formed a team to compete in Surgut’s Clean Games, a garbage collection and sorting competition to improve public places. The other 27 teams came from other local companies. The Unipro team collected enough trash to win third place. Title sponsor of the Rhein Marathon The Düsseldorf Marathon, one of Germany’s largest running and sporting events, is now the Uniper Marathon Düsseldorf. Formerly a premium partner, we became the annual event’s title sponsor in 2021. The sponsorship deepens Uniper’s long-standing commitment to Düsseldorf, home to its headquarters and hundreds of its employees, many of whom have participated in past marathons. The Uniper Marathon Düsseldorf, originally scheduled for late April 2022, had to be postponed because of the Covid-19 pandemic. A new date will be announced.

Road to Paris Team Düsseldorf brings together 23 athletes in nine sports with one dream: to compete in the 2024 Paris Olympic and Paralympic Games. In 2021 Uniper became a premium partner. Our financial support helps the organization enable the athletes to focus on their dream, while also preparing them for dual careers. Team members have won a total of 17 Olympic and Paralympic medals.
Supporting flood victims In mid-2021 floods severely damaged communities across southeast Germany and neighboring countries. Tragically, people lost their lives, and many homes and buildings were partially or completely destroyed. Uniper responded by donating €200,000 to relief projects in the flood zone.

Donating leftover food Eurest, the caterer of the canteen and café at our Düsseldorf headquarters, tries to prepare just enough fresh food each day to feed our employees and guests. Inevitably, though, there are leftovers. In 2021 Eurest, Uniper Real Estate Management, and Helping Hands, an employee-led charitable initiative, decided to make sure that as little food as possible goes to waste. Uniper now donates it to two charitable organizations in Düsseldorf: Firminus Klause (which feeds homeless elderly people) and SKFM (welfare service for girls and women aged 14 to 30).
Sports badges for kids Uniper has long supported SOS-Kinderdorf (SOS Children’s Village), a children and youth center in Garath, a Düsseldorf district with a high unemployment rate and numerous vulnerable families. We typically raise money for an annual donation, and in 2020 we partnered with Microsoft to provide free tablets to give the children a better home-schooling experience. In the summer of 2021, we collaborated with SOS-Kinderdorf to offer kids the opportunity to demonstrate their stamina, agility, and strength to earn a sports badge. There was also an awards ceremony the following week. The project was run by Helping Hands.
Music Summer at Walchensee power plant We first began transforming falling water into electricity at Höllriegelskreuth power station in 1894. Today, more than 125 years later, Uniper has a total of 2 GW of zero-carbon hydro capacity in Germany. It consists of more than 100 plants – some small, some very large – located primarily in Bavaria. These plants give us a close connection to dozens of communities. We try to be a good neighbor by regularly supporting local charitable institutions and cultural events. A new one – Music Summer at Walchensee power plant – premiered on July 13, 2021. Although the events were held before small audiences due to the Covid-19 pandemic, all were streamed live. We plan to repeat the concert series in 2022. Our hydropower business also supports the Saitenstrassen Festival, a biennial event devoted to alpine music played on string instruments (“Saite” is the German word for “string”). It takes place in three communities near our Walchensee plant.

GRI 102-11/16/17/18/19/20/26/29/31/33, 205-2, 404-2 The Uniper SE Board of Management bears overall responsibility for adopting and implementing Group-wide sustainability measures, with the Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO) playing a key role. The CSO reports periodically to the Super¬visory Board on strategic sustainability activities. As Uniper’s highest governance board, the Supervisory Board monitors the Group’s fulfillment of its sustainability obligations. In 2021, the Supervisory Board elected Prof. Dr. Werner Brinker as spokesperson of the Supervisory Board for climate and sustainability- related topics.
GRI 103-1/2 Good corporate governance is a top priority at Uniper. It is founded on close and efficient collaboration between the Management Board and the Supervisory Board. It guides all our decision-making and helps ensure that we achieve success responsibly and sustainably. The Management Board and Supervisory Board endorse the German Corporate Governance Code, which seeks to promote responsible and transparent corporate governance and controls.
Corporate governance. 
The CSO chairs Uniper’s Sustainability Council, which is a cross-functional committee that meets on a quarterly basis to monitor the implementation of Uniper’s sustainability strategy and governance framework across the Group. It consists of senior representatives of our key business areas and is supported by in-house and external experts. The Council aims to be a forum for informing the organization about sustainability issues and giving employees a voice in the ongoing dialogue.
The Board of Management has assigned the HSSE & Sustainability function the responsibility for defining Group-wide ESG targets and key performance indicators and for managing the ESG risk process.
The HSSE & Sustainability function reports to the Board of Management on the Uniper Group’s sustainability performance by means of quarterly performance dialogues. It also engages regularly with the Group Works Council through the Consultative Council, a cross-functional committee that meets biannually.
At Unipro, a sustainable development committee in the Board of Directors was established in September 2021. The key mission of the committee will be to take part in planning the strategic targets aimed at long-term sustainable development of Unipro, including environmental, social, and governance aspects, ESG controlling, as well as providing the Board of Directors with sustainability recommendations.

HSSE & Sustainability Improvement Plan. 
GRI 205-2, 404-2 Uniper functional units and subsidiaries have a responsibility to implement annual improvement measures to help meet the Group’s overall HSSE & Sustainability objectives.
Since January 1, 2020, the key performance indicator for managing Uniper’s group-wide HSSE & Sustainability performance has been the degree of implementation of its comprehensive HSSE & Sustainability Improvement Plan. In evaluating the target achievement of the Improvement Plan, three different levels of achievement are possible: below 100%, 100% and above 100% degree of implementation.
The purpose of Uniper’s 2021 HSSE & Sustainability Improvement Plan was on one hand to raise awareness among Uniper employees of the importance of sustainability at Uniper, and on the other hand to address the health challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic. Sustainability and health therefore became the key focus areas of the 2021 Plan.
For the purpose of raising employee awareness of sustainability, an eLearning course on the basics of sustainability at Uniper was developed and offered to all employees. Managers were asked to encourage their employees to participate and also to inform them about how their respective functions contribute to the strategy implementation at Uniper. A large share of Uniper employees (68%) have completed the eLearning course. In the area of health protection, the improvement plan stipulated that all functions should implement the specific measures planned for their area.
The year-end progress reports on the improvement plan show that the overall degree of implementation was 120% against the target level. Participation in the sustainability eLearning course and communication of the contributions made by different teams on this topic were particularly successful. This is also related to the fact that sustainability issues are already integrated into day-to-day business in many areas. The Company also met its expectations for health, as a range of measures were implemented to shield employees from the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. In addition, the responsibility of the individual teams for health in their area was strengthened, as they each had to assess the need for measures themselves.
Policies. 
GRI 102-16/17/20 Uniper has sound policies in place to manage its material ESG issues. These policies, which are monitored on a regular basis, stipulate how the Group addresses ESG concerns and how it coordinates the cascade effects across the organization. The HSSE & Sustainability Policy Statement defines Uniper’s ambitions and priorities for HSSE & Sustainability. It provides the framework for developing the Sustainability Strategic Plan (SSP) and for evaluating its effectiveness.
In addition to the statement, Uniper’s Code of Conduct, which is binding for all employees, defines basic principles of conduct for a wide range of issues, such as combating corruption and human rights violations. It provides guidance and support for conducting business and behaving in the workplace in compliance with the law and Company rules. Each year, Board of Management members and senior managers sign a written pledge to adhere to the code. The code is reviewed and updated periodically to ensure appropriateness and compliance with Company and regulatory requirements. A revised version was adopted in 2020. Compliance and Code of Conduct training is mandatory for all Uniper employees from 2021 onward.
The Group strives to work, whenever possible, with third parties that have comparable values and principles. It requires its suppliers to sign a declaration of compliance with the Uniper Supplier Code of Conduct. Uniper has a Know-Your-Counterparty (KYC) Business Policy in place. Its purpose is to enhance existing processes for identifying, verifying, and reporting the main compliance risks potentially posed by new counterparties before business deals are finalized. These risks include corruption, money laundering, terrorism financing, and the violation of economic sanctions. We also have a screening process for identifying counterparties with exposure to ESG risks. The process is described in the next section.
The policies, business directives, and Code of Conduct are available to all employees electronically on the Uniper intranet.
Overview Planet People & Society Responsible Governance Appendix. 
Capital allocation and incentivization In order to support the strategy execution towards carbon-neutrality, Uniper’s capital allocation is geared towards investments that are green according to Uniper’s ESG evaluation framework considering internal ESG criteria, as well as the climate-related environmental objectives 1 and 2 from the EU taxonomy. Hence, the impact on climate is evaluated within strategic and financial decisions on growth projects. Depending on the level of contribution towards Uniper’s decarbonization targets and the compatibility with the EU taxonomy, different hurdle rates are used for financial assessment: the return expectation for “green” projects is 100 basis points lower compared to “non-green” projects. Furthermore, following the implementation of the TCFD framework in 2021, Uniper has started to include a “well below 2°C” commodity price scenario in the financial assessment of new projects in selective cases.
Uniper has embedded its decarbonization ambitions into the incentive schemes for management. Within the long-term incentive scheme, 40% of the target amount is based on non-financial targets, that is further split into two groups: 20% is based on the successful transformation of Uniper’s portfolio towards carbon-neutrality. The other 20% is contingent on predefined ESG targets. For the 2021 tranche, the ESG target will be considered achieved once Uniper fully implemented the TCFD recommendations. For the 2022 tranche, the absolute CO₂ reduction of the European Generation segment is relevant. The target is based on a predefined reduction path for the European fleet. For the short-term incentive scheme with respect to Uniper’s ESG strategy, the delivery of the HSSE & Sustainability Improvement Plan, which also reflects climate-related topics, is incorporated into the Company performance as described in the following.

GRI 102-43 Our objective is to have a positive impact on sustainability by integrating ESG aspects into our supplier selection and decision- making process. In selecting suppliers, we apply sustainability criteria that are relevant to our procurement categories and also meet our business requirements. The criteria reflect the SDGs prioritized in our sustainability strategy. From 2021 onward, this process has been supported by a new digital tool developed in-house in 2020: the Sustainability Impact Compass. The tool, which supplements our existing processes (such as mandatory KYC and Code of Conduct checks during supplier registration), is used to identify and prioritize category-specific sustainability issues and provide recommendations on tender evaluation criteria. It enables procurement managers to quickly identify suppliers with ESG issues, receive guidance on how these issues can be measured, and find examples of how to ask suppliers for information on relevant issues.
Case study: supplying responsibly sourced gas in Canada. 
In 2021 Uniper, Calgary-based gas producer Vermilion Energy, and Rockpoint Gas Storage Canada Ltd. finalized an innovative gas supply agreement that will bring responsibly sourced natural gas to end- users. Under the agreement, Uniper will offtake certified natural gas from Vermilion Energy and manage supply to Access Gas Services, a wholesale supplier and affiliate of Rockpoint Gas Storage that provides natural gas and related services to commercial, industrial, and institutional customers in Canada. The gas is certified to be responsibly sourced by Equitable Origin’s EO100™ Standard for Responsible Energy Development.

GRI 103-2 We systematically assess the external and internal ESG risks that could arise from our operations. ESG risk management is part of our overall enterprise risk management. Uniper has measures in place to control, minimize, and mitigate the ESG risks it identifies. The management actions that Uniper plans and implements are incorporated into its governance structure, responsibilities, and relevant policies. Uniper has an ESG Task Force in place, a cross-functional steering group whose purpose is to ensure that ESG risks are identified, assessed, and mitigated. Uniper has the aforementioned Know-Your- Counterparty (KYC) Business Policy in place to mitigate ESG risks in its supply chain.
GRI 102/11, 103-2, 205-1, 404-2, 412-1, 414-1/2 On an annual basis, we perform a worldwide assessment, which is based on a combination of economic and social indexes, to map key potential country-specific issues – such as working conditions, violation of political rights, and civil liberties as well as security threats – that may directly affect Uniper. The assessment’s findings resulted in the implementation of modified due diligence requirements and mitigation measures, such as the inclusion of specific contract clauses, particularly when negotiating with new counterparties operating in medium- or high- risk countries.
We apply special scrutiny to commercial counterparties or projects in high-risk countries with a Corruption Perception Index (CPI) score below 30, indicating a high level of perceived corruption. This is a conventional threshold reflecting the systemic weakness of a country’s institutions. We place such countries on a watch list that we update annually. If the geopolitical and ESG risks warrant it, we may also place countries with a CPI score above 30 on the watch list. Fuel procurement and commodities trading in particular are among the Uniper businesses exposed to these kinds of country-specific issues. We also assess our counterparties’ ESG risk exposure. As part of Uniper’s KYC and Procurement policies, the HSSE & Sustainability function has developed and implemented a screening process1 to identify counterparties with exposure to ESG risks. The process is aligned with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (2011), the OECD Guidelines on Multinational Enterprises (2011), and relevant implementing documents, which aim to embed responsible business conduct into policies and management systems. Its purpose is to define the right prevention and mitigation measures for each of them and to advise the Uniper Board of Management accordingly. The objective is to avoid doing business with counterparties causing or contributing to ongoing and severe adverse impacts on ESG issues, including human rights.
Uniper has a strategic sustainability target of using the screening process to assess 100% of all counterparties by 2022. At the end of 2021, 59% of active counterparties had been assessed by means of the screening process.
1Unipro PJSC, Unipro PJSC’s subsidiaries, and Uniper NefteGaz LLC (currently dormant) do not use the ESG due diligence screening process because they do not fall within the scope of the Uniper KYC and Procurement policies. Suppliers not subject to mandatory registration as described in Uniper’s procurement policies are also not subject to the screening process. Unipro PJSC has implemented its own KYC and Procurement policies.

Significant RepRisk® Rating: CCC CC C 158 CCC, CC, and C denote high ESG risk exposure. 
Major RepRisk® Rating: D 5 D denotes very high ESG risk exposure. 
Methodology: the RepRisk® rating depends on a company’s own performance (such as ESG risk incidents) and on its country and sector affiliations. RepRisk® helps us benchmark a counterparty against a peer group and the sector. The impact of ESG risk incidents depends on the reach of information sources, the frequency and timing of ESG risk incidents, and the risk incident content; that is, the severity and novelty of the issues addressed.
Uniper Sustainability Report 2021. 
We conduct robust compliance checks and consider any credible media source raising concerns over ESG issues. The decision to enter or continue a business relationship with suppliers classified as high risk is taken by a Risk Committee, which also includes Board of Management members. ESG considerations are discussed if a supplier has been flagged as exposed to major or significant ESG risks during preliminary desktop research. We rely on third- party software intelligence, providing a classification of risk levels (significant: CCC-C; Major: D).
In 2021, we prioritized the assessment of our Global Commodities segment’s existing and potential counterparties as well as the suppliers related to our procurement of goods and services and the customers of our Engineering and Energy Services departments.
We perform these assessments using the RepRisk® ESG Risk Platform, the world’s largest and most comprehensive due diligence database of ESG and business conduct risks. With expertise in 20 languages and coverage of more than 140,000 public and private companies and over 35,000 infrastructure projects, this tool facilitates in-depth risk research on companies, infrastructure projects, sectors, and countries.
The 2021 assessment found that the vast majority 70% of our counterparties pose low ESG risks.
(70%) of our counterparties pose low ESG risks. Counterparties with moderate ESG risks account for 24.6%; 5.2% pose significant risks and less than 0.2% have major ESG risks. No counterparties were considered unacceptable based on the information available. However, mitigation measures will be introduced for all direct suppliers showing major or significant ESG risks. Energy services, fuel procurement, and commodity trading are our businesses most exposed to these kinds of country-specific issues. In 2021 we included ESG expectations in our contracts with three commodity suppliers with significant risks.
It is important, however, to point out the limitations of our current assessments, which consist mainly of desktop research and rely on input from data providers whose methodologies differ. We therefore welcome the European Commission’s initiative to introduce an EU Due Diligence Act which helps create a level playing field across countries and sectors. We advocate a framework that clearly defines the scope of application, companies’ obligations, and the cases where liability is limited. In addition, for a legal framework to be effective, it should be practical, tangible, and timely to implement. The future EU framework should be applicable to EU-based companies but also to non-EU companies operating in the EU or doing business with EU-based companies to ensure such a level playing field. The EU framework would be proportionate and hence address the relationships between companies and their suppliers where commercial influence can be exercised. Due to the importance of human rights and largely global value chains, we also advocate multilateral solutions. In addition, we welcome direct reports of supply-chain-related issues from concerned citizens, civil society organizations, and other stakeholders. Since 2021, any information that we receive that is considered substantiated and credible is included in our due diligence assessments and supply chain monitoring efforts. Individuals or organizations who wish to communicate with us on these matters can contact us at:

ESG due diligence for projects and initiatives. 
GRI 103-2/3 Effective as of April 2020, any project or business initiative that requires approval by top management must consider ESG factors. The objective is to ensure that Uniper management is aware of the relevant ESG elements when assessing and approving projects and business initiatives and that it maximizes value creation by considering their strategic fit, financial merits, and risks. The HSSE & Sustainability function conducts the ESG evaluation by analyzing a project’s compatibility with Uniper’s Sustainability Strategic Plan and with objective ESG screening criteria. Effective as of July 2020, the EU Taxonomy on Sustainable Finance is the source of the main ESG screening criteria used in our ESG evaluations. Projects that meet its criteria and contribute to, or at least do not hinder, the achievement of Uniper’s sustainability targets are assigned a lower hurdle rate to incentivize their implementation. Where necessary, HSSE & Sustainability’s evaluation includes recommendations aimed at mitigating the ESG risks identified and to help meet ESG expectations once a project is implemented.
ESG monitoring of gas, liquefied natural gas (LNG), and related infrastructure In line with our plan to expand our diversified gas business and progressively decarbonize it, we began to conduct ESG due diligence of individual projects and deals. We believe that working with strategic gas suppliers to mitigate ESG risks along the value chain can have significant positive impacts for communities involved and for the planet as a whole. Since 2020, we have been focusing on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions transparency, including methane monitoring, as the most material issue to address.
For ESG due diligence to succeed, we need to define adequate screening and monitoring criteria, engage in trust building with local communities (particularly if they are directly affected by gas operations), and forge partnerships with project developers and civil society organizations. We started this process in 2020 by launching dialogues with our main gas and LNG suppliers in Russia, Australia, and the United States to foster transparency on GHG emissions and identify other ESG impacts to be addressed. We met with our main Russian supplier twice in 2021 to discuss methane emission management and ongoing engagement activities with affected communities. One example is the impact of oil and gas extraction in the Yamal Peninsula in northwest Siberia, where indigenous communities need support to maintain their traditional way of life.

The EU taxonomy The EU taxonomy is a classification system that establishes a list of environmentally sustainable economic activities. The taxonomy is expected to help direct sustainable investments toward the areas where they are most needed, protect private investors from greenwashing, and help companies plan their transition to sustainability. The path toward meeting the EU’s climate goals will require massive financing. We welcome the efforts of the European Commission to steer sustainable investments through science-based policy mechanisms, such as the European Sustainable Finance Strategy and the Taxonomy Regulation. It is important that all activities that can contribute to the success of the transformation of Europe’s economy toward greater sustainability in the short, medium, and long-term are considered. As such, we welcome the delegated acts for climate mitigation and adaptation which signal the need for a clear decarbonization pathway for enabling and transitional activities.

What is TCFD and why is it relevant for Uniper? Climate change presents significant risks and opportunities for companies. It is a topic of great importance to investors and banks. The financial markets expect clear, comprehensive and high-quality information on the impact of climate change on.
This is where the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) comes in. This international initiative, supported by the G20 countries, aims to improve and expand the reporting of climate-related financial information. The TCFD working group developed a framework to help companies systematically identify and communicate climate-related information to external parties. TCFD focuses on the question: What are the Company’s climate-relevant opportunities and risks and how does it manage them?
Who is involved in implementing TCFD? To implement the TCFD, an interdisciplinary project team comprising around 15 colleagues from Strategy, Risk Management, HSSE & Sustainability, Accounting, Public Relations, and Group Finance & Investor Relations was set up in February. During the course of the project, the team is being supported by numerous other colleagues from the Market Analytics, Finance, and Operations departments, among others.
What information do companies provide under the TCFD? At the core of the TCFD framework are 11 transparency recommendations from four areas: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets: • Governance: How is the Board of Management involved in assessing and managing climate- related risks? How does the Supervisory Board oversee climate-related risks and opportunities? What processes are in place for this? • Strategy: What are the key climate-related opportunities and risks for the Company? How robust is the corporate strategy if the world develops in line with a “well below 2 degrees” scenario, i.e., if an environment emerges in which we manage to stay below 2 degrees of further global warming? And what is the impact of such a scenario on the Company’s risks, opportunities, and strategy? • Risk management: How does the Company identify, assess and manage climate-related opportunities and risks? How are these processes integrated into the Company-wide risk management system? • Metrics and targets: What metrics and targets does the Company use to manage and implement its strategy with regard to climate-relevant factors?
An interview with Eva Götze, Manager in Investor Relations, on the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)
Where does Uniper stand in terms of implementation? Although full implementation of the TCFD framework often takes three years at other companies, we have already accomplished a great deal this year and were able to publish our first TCFD report as part of Uniper’s 2021 Annual Report covering all 11 recommendations.
What is planned for 2022? In 2022, we will continue to work on embedding the TCFD into our organization. This will include further integration of the climate risk process into the existing risk management system.

These may result from misconduct or violations of laws and regulations, either from actions by our staff or by third parties acting on our behalf. To mitigate risks, we have had a Group-wide Compliance Management System (CMS) in place since January 1, 2016.

Each year, the Board of Management members and senior managers sign a written pledge to adhere to the Code. The Code is reviewed and updated periodically to ensure appropriateness and compliance with Company and regulatory requirements.
The Code addresses a wide range of issues, including compliance, anti-corruption, and respect for human rights. It also describes the consequences of improper conduct toward business partners,
The following legal areas and related activities are relevant for our Company and therefore constitute our main compliance topics: • Anti-corruption and anti-bribery • Anti-money-laundering and anti-terrorist financing • Capital market compliance • Competition law • Economic sanctions • Trading compliance. 
Uniper’s CMS sets uniform standards for compliance topics that reflect our specific compliance risks. We consider the CMS appropriate and effective if it can detect compliance risks and prevent compliance breaches with an adequate degree of certainty. The CMS incorporates the reporting of any compliance violations that have occurred. In addition, it facilitates improvements to its own mechanisms. The CMS includes quarterly compliance reports to the Board of Management. Their purpose is to provide the Board of Management with the information it needs to monitor the CMS’s performance. The Board of Management has appointed a Chief Compliance Officer, who reports to the CEO, the Board of Management, and the Supervisory Board’s Audit Committee. The Chief Compliance Officer is responsible for the CMS and is supported by the Senior Vice President for Compliance. The Board of Management has also underscored the importance of compliance in its Compliance Commitment, which is available on-
We operate with the highest ethical standards in everything we do and everywhere we do business, going beyond adhering to laws and regulations. It’s about “living with integrity” which is a pivotal part of our company culture. Wrongdoing can cause considerable damage to both stakeholders and Uniper. It is important to systematically prevent and take actions against violations of the laws and regulations. This is the only way to credibly convey that our company is being managed responsibly and is committed to creating sustainable value.

Overview Planet People & Society Responsible Governance Appendix 405 new counterparties assessed and approved third parties, and government institutions, as well as the procedures to be followed in such cases. This applies to violations of laws combating corruption, money laundering, anticompetitive practices, and the financing of terrorism. The Code also addresses issues such as compliance with economic sanctions, the granting and acceptance of gifts and hospitality, intermediaries’ involvement, and the selection of suppliers and service providers. Other issues it covers include avoiding conflicts of interest and handling Company information, property, and resources. Our compliance policies and procedures ensure that the investigation, evaluation, and cessation of reported violations are carried out appropriately by the respective Compliance Officers and our Chief Compliance Officer. Suspected violations of the Code can be reported anonymously through a whistleblower hotline. Violations may lead to disciplinary action and termination of employment.
Relevant employees are regularly trained in policies and systems that help prevent corruption. A new compliance eLearning module on the basic principles of the Uniper Code of Conduct was successfully introduced in 2021 for all 11,775 active Uniper Group employees. At year-end, the completion rate was at 89%. Messages from the CEO, CCO, and Chief Compliance Officer, along with other internal communications, underscored the module’s importance. In addition, the fourth quarter 2021 issue of Uniper’s new in-house Compliance Impulses Newsletter featured an analysis of the issue of corruption, including an educational video.
Uniper strives to work, whenever possible, with third parties whose principles are like the Code’s. In addition, we require our suppliers to sign a declaration of compliance with the Uniper Supplier Code of Conduct.
Anti-corruption. 
GRI 103-2, 205-1/2/3, 404-2 Corruption and bribery promote social inequality and crime, undermine public confidence, and increase the cost of transactions. Noncompliance with laws or Company policies aimed at combating corruption may lead to criminal and civil liability, not only for the persons involved but also for the Group and its directors and officers. It may also potentially damage Uniper’s reputation. We have zero tolerance of bribery and corruption. Engaging in any form of corruption – whether with public officials, customers, or enterprise partners – is considered a breach of the Code and leads to employment termination. Employees are prohibited from offering, promising, or giving anything of value (such as money, gifts, offers of employment, or other benefits) to gain business, to influence any action, or for any additional advantage, especially to a public official. They are likewise prohibited from doing so indirectly through a spouse, partner, relative, or friend. In some countries, business relations with intermediaries (agents, brokers, advisors, representatives, and so forth) pose a higher risk of corruption and bribery. Consequently, Uniper carries out all such relationships in accordance with its Business Policy Intermediary Agreements. The purpose of this policy’s strict rules is to prevent an intermediary’s fee or commission being used to make illegal payments on Uniper’s behalf.
One of the risks assessed in the aforementioned CRA was corruption along with several risk factors, such as contact with counterparties, intermediaries, donations and sponsoring, and conflict of interest.
In a rapidly changing global business environment, we need to be aware of external restrictions on our business activities. We are committed to com- plying with all applicable economic sanctions and other forms of international restrictions. Uniper has business dealings with counterparties worldwide, including those located in countries that rank low on Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index, indicating a high level of perceived corruption. Failure to fulfill the legal and regulatory requirements necessary to comply with key anti- corruption rules would lead to serious reputational, legal, and financial impacts for the Group. Employees with counterparties in such countries are trained regularly in policies and systems that help prevent corruption.
Uniper has a Know-Your-Counterparty Business Policy in place for identifying, verifying, and reporting the main compliance risks potentially posed by new counterparties before business deals are finalized. These risks include corruption, money laundering, terrorism financing, and non-compliance with economic sanctions. The policy’s introduction was accompanied by an eLearning module and classroom training entitled Know Your Counterparty, Intermediaries, and Sanctions, the purpose of which is to familiarize staff across the organization with the enhanced processes. The Compliance function used these processes to assess 436 new counterparties (excluding those of Unipro) in 2021 (2020: 428), 405 of which were approved and six were rejected due to compliance risks. The remainder were either withdrawn or are under assessment.
One new instance of alleged corruption and bribery was reported at Uniper in 2021 and closed as unfounded. One pending case from 2020 was closed as unfounded.

Safeguarding personal data. 
GRI 103-1/2/3, 404-2 The protection and secure handling of employee and customer data have a high priority for us. Data protection is crucial to avoid fines and prevent harm to our Company’s reputation. Putting appropriate technical and organizational measures in place enables us to reduce these risks and deepen our customers’ and employees’ trust. As a matter of course, we ensure the same level of data protection with our service providers as inside our Company.
Uniper is a multinational company that operates in numerous countries. Consequently, compliance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other similar national and international regulations is crucial for our success and our stakeholders’ trust. We therefore take numerous precautions and continually work on making our data protection organization even better, including in consultation with outside experts. This has also enabled us to raise awareness of data protection inside our Company and among our business partners.
Our data protection organization is set up in accordance with our Functional Policy for Data Protection. The Group Data Protection team is responsible for coordinating and monitoring the data protection activities for all fully consolidated Uniper companies. In addition, a Data Protection Council, consisting of senior managers of relevant departments and the Chief Financial Officer, meet on a quarterly basis. Its purpose is to strengthen and support our data protection organization. Thirty-two data protection coordinators serve as the interface with our operating business. Their task is to identify data protection risks and reinforce awareness of data protection in our front-line operations. In 2021, they took on additional roles and responsibilities, such as supporting data protection risk management assessments, participating in awareness campaigns, and providing information to the business and management.
New data protection coordinators receive classroom training for their role. Data protection also remains an integral part of the onboarding training for new employees. Furthermore, we rolled out a revised eLearning refresher module on the GDPR, which is mandatory for all employees and contractors in the EU and the European Economic Area (EEA). We also began providing specialized and interactive classroom training on IT subjects. In addition, Uniper’s corporate intranet offers information about the GDPR, such as data protection requirements for commonly used software applications, Covid-19 updates related to data protection, an information security and data protection awareness month, a data protection holiday calendar, and videos. We also continued existing GDPR awareness campaigns, such as the plan for a data protection capability compass.
Uniper uses a software called Prime to manage data protection. It enables us to ensure and document data protection compliance and continuously monitor all activities and measures related to data protection that are being implemented across the organization. We improved Prime in 2021 in areas like process automation and automated interfaces to selected cloud computing.
In 2021, Uniper assessed the processing activities of its data protection risk management and identified technical and organizational improvements, which were partially implemented by year-end. One example is the deletion of structured and unstructured HR data.

Tax transparency. 
GRI 102-30, 103-1/2/3, 207-1/3/4 Taxes play an important role in the jurisdictions where we operate: they enable countries and communities to fund vital services. Uniper is committed to complying with applicable tax law and regulations, paying respective taxes, and always considering not only the letter but also the spirit of the law. We also seek to have an open and constructive relationship with tax authorities.
The Group Executive Vice President Tax formulates and is responsible for our approach to tax. Our Code of Conduct defines proper business behavior at Uniper as one of the main principles of integrity. Our approach to tax is governed by several business policies, including the Group Tax Guidelines. This policy is supplemented by our policy for our Internal Control System. In addition, the Uniper Supervisory Board’s Audit and Risk Committee monitors the Internal Control System and Risk Management System.
Tax issues, like all other business risks, are identified, assessed, managed, and monitored pursuant to the Uniper Enterprise Risk Management Policy. There is no predefined level of tax risk that Uniper is prepared to accept. Risk is assessed in relation to a transaction’s materiality and other associated risks. In cases of uncertainty and when possible, Uniper typically engages with the relevant tax authority to obtain a pre-transaction ruling.
Uniper’s approach to tax governance, control, and risk management is described in detail in Uniper’s 2021 Tax Transparency Report. Uniper also publishes income tax information as part of the Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2021 Annual Report.
Compliance with the GDPR. 
GRI 103-2/3, 418-1 We must comply with the GDPR requirements. Consequently, we – together with the affected departments – put in place additional appropriate TOMs to ensure data protection when we process, store, and transmit personal data, especially, in the wake of the EJC’s Schrems II ruling, outside the EU and EEA.
The third parties that we hire to process personal data also have to comply with the GDPR. Our GDPR compliance efforts focused on minimizing the risk of information leaks and managing personal data to avoid any breaches of data protection. In accordance with best practices, we analyzed and documented how data is stored and accessed.
We also introduced new measures to avoid the misuse of business-relevant data or unauthorized external access. These included raising awareness regarding the use of Microsoft sensitivity labels and OneDrive. Misuse or the inadvertent dissemination of confidential information by an employee could lead to the disclosure of commercial secrets or violate data protection laws. Our robust data protection includes rules and guidelines as well as monthly reporting on key performance indicators.
Thirty-three data protection complaints were made in 2021, where 17 of them were rated as data breaches, and 16 were not rated as breaches. No data breaches had to be reported to the responsible data protection authority. Due to frequent changes in applications and cyberthreats, we continually invest in data protection and further improve our protection measures. We are committed to staying up to date on applicable processes and technologies.
A total of 144 internal EU Model Clauses (EUMCs) with Uniper legal entities in the United Kingdom were concluded in the second quarter of 2021. Subsequently, an adequacy decision for the United Kingdom was granted by the European Commission, and the remaining Brexit preparatory activities were temporarily suspended. Uniper UK’s Data Protection Officer continually monitors that country’s data protection laws and regulations in order to ensure compliance.
Uniper analyzed new rulings by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) and began taking steps to comply with the resulting requirements. This includes the ECJ’s Schrems II ruling. We completed the process of identifying and analyzing relevant processing activities, applications, and contracts in third countries. The Schrems II ruling requires us to identify technical and organizational measures (TOMs) that are affected by it. We began this process in 2021 by having 20 of our third-country service providers complete a pilot TOMs questionnaire. We also designed a framework for the transfer impact assessment (TIA), which will be a mandatory part of new EUMCs concluded from 2022 onward.

Lobbying. 
GRI 102-12/13 Energy supply is a heavily regulated business and the subject of ongoing policy debate, particularly with regard to climate protection. The European Union’s commitment to becoming the first climate-neutral continent will necessitate the fundamental transformation of its energy system. This, in turn, will require a policy and regulatory environment that enables companies like Uniper to take action that will help propel Europe’s decarbonization journey but also makes both business and environmental sense. Advocacy of our business interests is essential for the successful operation of our assets and for our strategic prospects.
One example is the establishment of a hydrogen market, which will be essential for decarbonizing heavy industry, maritime transport, aviation, and other sectors. Uniper is working directly and through affiliated associations to develop proposals for the right regulatory framework to enable existing gas infrastructure to accept more renewable and low-carbon gases and to promote system integration across all energy vectors and sectors.
Financing the energy transition is another example. As the path towards meeting the EU’s climate goals will require significant financing, we welcome the efforts of the European Commission to steer sustainable investments through science-based policy instruments, such as the European Sustainable Finance Strategy and the Taxonomy Regulation. Since 2020 Uniper has been advocating for a technology-neutral approach, to reflect the positive role of transitional activities while recognizing the need for credible emissions performance standards and thresholds.
In 2021 Uniper also participated in consultations related to the EU Methane Strategy implementation, arguing that a progressive approach is needed to regulate methane emissions in the energy sector. Due to a current lack of data on methane emissions, the European Commission should focus on establishing prescriptive monitoring, reporting, and verification requirements in a first step, and performance-based requirements in a second step. We recommended that the European Commission shall assess whether methane emissions mitigation measures are also needed in other sectors in order to ensure a level playing field.
Finally, we advocated for EU-wide minimum requirements for environmental, social, and governance-related due diligence activities and stakeholder engagement processes. We believed that harmonized definitions and processes are necessary to overcome divergent national legislation. The framework should also clearly define the scope as well as individual obligations in relation to responsible supply chain management.
We are in ongoing dialogue with a variety of external stakeholders, such as government entities, regulatory agencies, trade associations, and other third-party stakeholders with a vested interest in the political process. We believe that this dialogue helps inform and shape the political process, enabling policymakers to make more informed decisions.
Transparency regarding our engagement with policymakers is of the utmost importance. For example, Uniper has been registered in the EU’s Transparency registry under 285977820662-03 since its spin-off in 2016.

Stakeholder engagement. 
GRI 102-40/43 Engaging with our various stakeholder groups creates opportunities to learn more about their needs, concerns, and expectations regarding our Company and business activities. It also enables us to present our perspective on a sustainable energy world and our role in bringing it about. This open dialogue promotes understanding and trust, and also helps us to identify and minimize our business activities’ potential adverse impacts.
Our Stakeholder Management Policy stipulates how we interact with stakeholders. It defines our objectives for internal and external communications and assigns roles and responsibilities. The channels and formats vary. We communicate with our employees through e-mails, flyers, posters, videos, Web chats, and all-hands meetings. Trade fairs, open houses, and conferences give us the opportunity to meet and talk with a large number of stakeholders. Public forums for people who live near our assets foster dialogue with community representatives and local interest groups. We also engage regularly with policymakers, the media, civil society organizations, and non- governmental organizations (NGOs). In 2021 the Covid-19 pandemic made it necessary to suspend some engagement activities and hold others virtually.
Engagement with our investors is conducted by the Board of Management and the Investor Relations team. It is governed by our Stakeholder Management Policy as well as the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) and other relevant laws. The section below entitled “Engaging with investors” provides more information.
Identifying and Engaging with NGOs. 
GRI 102-21/43 In order to identify and effectively engage with NGOs, Uniper regularly tracks the activities of international organizations that work on topics that are relevant to Uniper, such as coal, hydrogen, GHG emissions, and human rights. This supports us in making well-founded decisions on how and when to engage.
Uniper’s NGO engagement journey moved forward in 2021. Our journey started in 2017 when we established the Uniper Sustainability Roundtable, a forum for NGOs and representatives of relevant Uniper departments to discuss issues related to our business. The roundtable’s purpose is to maintain constructive dialogue with NGOs and share perspectives, including on aspects of our business that they consider controversial. These discussions enable us to continually learn more – including about ourselves – and to identify opportunities to continuously improve. The Sustainability Roundtable and other dialogues were again held online in 2021 because of the pandemic. As in prior years, discussions focused on decarbonization, our accelerated coal exit, human rights and environmental impacts along the coal supply chain, as well as the environmental impact of gas transportation and exploration.
The Uniper management receives updates on the engagement activities in regular performance dialogues and via the Sustainability Council. On critical NGO topics, relevant internal stakeholders are informed and, where necessary, involved directly in the dialogues.
Uniper has committed to conducting, at the corporate level, at least three dialogues with critical stakeholders each year. In 2021 we conducted six formal dialogues, thereby surpassing the target. In addition, a virtual group-wide panel discussion on the future hydrogen economy was held. An NGO representative, other stakeholders, and more than 800 Uniper employees participated. We have now expanded the previous target to engage in trust-building dialogues and cooperative discussions with up to five NGOs per year by 2023.
Over time, these discussions have involved an increasing number of NGOs and issues. They have steadily enriched our understanding, broadened our horizons, and added to our expertise. Going forward, Uniper will therefore expand its engagement with critical stakeholders on a national and international level.

Engaging with shareholders. 
GRI 102-43 Uniper’s Board of Management and Investor Relations team are in constant dialogue with various capital market participants, including current and potential shareholders. Our main purpose is to ensure transparency by providing investors with relevant financial and non-financial information. We also actively solicit the capital market’s feedback on our strategy, operations, and disclosures and factor it into our decision-making.
Uniper is approached by various investors and investor initiatives to provide detailed information on its decarbonization strategy. We deal openly with these inquiries, prioritize them, and seek to enter into active and transparent discussions. Investor engagement mainly focuses on corporate governance on climate change, emissions targets, and business plans that propel progress toward a net-zero future. This dialogue helps investors better understand the way we integrate decarbonization into our strategy and our efforts to improve our climate governance and performance. In addition, discussing and understanding investors’ views on those topics help us become an even better Company.

Bettercoal: Russia and Colombia working groups. 
GRI 102-12/43 Bettercoal, a not-for-profit initiative established by a group of major European utilities committed to a more responsible coal supply chain, has voluntary working groups that focus on major coal supply countries. Their purpose is to better understand and mitigate the risks in these countries, to enhance the monitoring of mining companies’ improvement plans, and to propose solutions to regional systemic issues. Uniper chairs the Columbia working group and participates in the Russia group.
The Colombia working group continued to implement its work program in 2021. It met virtually in the second quarter with Colombian stakeholders. They included suppliers, governmental agencies, dialogue institutions, victim organizations, NGOs, and trade unions. These discussions helped the working group prioritize issues in its work program, identify opportunities for specific action where Bettercoal can have a positive impact in the region, and address other issues relevant in the Colombian mining context.
The Russia working group continued its engagement in 2021 as well, despite the limitations posed by the Covid-19 pandemic. It conducted two virtual conferences on mine closure and land restoration, health and safety, and environmental monitoring. Since Uniper’s procurement of coal from Russia will cease after 2022, the future of Uniper’s membership in the Russian working group is uncertain.

Innovation. 
Our innovation strategy reflects the three pivotal trends that are transforming the energy industry: decarbonization, the decentralization of energy generation and supply, and digitalization. We have the assets and energy IQ to shape these trends in a way that creates value for our Company and for society. To stay on the right track for innovation, we review and, if necessary, update our innovation strategy on an annual basis. This process involves all relevant stakeholders and business units.
GRI 103-1 Innovation and the development of new sustainable businesses play a key role in Uniper’s decarbonization strategy and, more generally, help propel the transition to a climate-neutral future. We develop scalable business models, particularly those relating to green hydrogen, heat, gases, and fuels.
GRI 103-2/3 and 302-2/4 Uniper has invested in numerous pilot projects to refine, scale up, and deploy a variety of technologies on a commercial scale. In addition, we set a target of conducting, by year-end 2022, at least 20 projects whose main aims include decarbonization. We were working on 35 such projects at year-end 2021, far surpassing our target a year ahead of schedule.
Uniper also develops innovative flexibility solutions, which support the energy transition in two ways. First, they balance out the fluctuations in renewables output; this capability will help support the integration of large amounts of renewables capac- ity. Second, the flexibility provided by energy storage or conversion can capture more of this output. For example, Li-ion batteries can store daytime solar energy for use in the evening. They can also provide frequency containment reserve to help stabilize the grid when wind output fluctuates. Some regions, like northeast Germany, produce more wind power than they can consume. Wind farms sometimes have to shut down temporarily to prevent grid overloads. Batteries could make this unnecessary and enable such regions to capture more of their renewable resource.
High hopes for hydrogen. 
GRI 102-13 Even in a carbon-neutral future, many hardto-abate industries – such as heavy-duty transport, maritime shipping, aviation, steel, and chemicals – will continue to need carbon-based energy sources and chemicals. This is where low- and zero- carbon hydrogen can be a game changer. It can be combined with captured CO2 to produce climate- neutral chemicals as well as green diesel and synthetic jet fuel. The CO2 is captured from power generation and industrial processes or, ideally, from biogenic processes like biomethane production or directly from the air. Simply put, hydrogen is the only way to put some high-emissions industries on a realistic path to carbon neutrality. Uniper is partnering with leading companies and research institutes in pilot projects to gain experience in.

We concluded the feasibility study on CO2 utilization in the federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia that we conducted with the German Aerospace Center’s (DLR) Institute for Future Fuels. The study, which was partially funded by the IN4climateNRW initiative, looked at CO2 utilization at a chemicals plant as a test case for identifying its main opportunities and challenges, particularly in the state’s industrialized Ruhr region. It concluded that CO2 utilization is in general feasible, but the economics remain a challenge and require respective regulation and/or subsidies.
Uniper is working with several partners to produce renewable jet fuel for Rotterdam The Hague Airport. Equipment powered by renewable electricity will be used to capture CO2 from the air and convert it into green jet fuel.

LNG for cleaner, quieter heavy-duty transport With the amount of freight hauled by road on the increase, LNG offers a quick and efficient way to make heavy vehicle traffic more sustainable. Trucks that run on LNG emit less CO2, nitrogen oxide, and particulate matter than diesel-powered trucks. They are also much quieter. Uniper’s subsidiary LIQVIS supports this trend by operating a growing network of LNG fueling stations for LNG-powered heavy- duty trucks in Germany and France. In the future, bio-LNG could help make heavy-duty transport more sustainable. Although little is currently available in Germany, in 2021 LIQVIS secured a supply of bio-LNG to be delivered beginning in the third quarter of 2022. The Company intends to offer more bio-LNG going forward to help propel the decarbonization of heavy-duty transport.

Dr. Peter Struckmann, EVP - COO Digital Evolution, introduces COODE Our new digital transformation program is called COO Digital Evolution – COODE. We call it digital evolution and not revolution or disruption because with COODE we are not looking at new business models on how to make money with digital tools or from data, but at continuously improving how we operate our physical assets and run our business processes, so that we drive value for our Company.
The focus of COODE is on operational problems and the ideas from our ~4,500 fleet operational colleagues. Engineers love solving problems and this is at the core of this digitalization initiative – it is not about the latest technology or APP, it is about our people who know their operations best, having a problem and an idea on how to do something better.
Digitalization. 
Digitalization is playing an increasingly important role in decarbonization. Uniper draws on its engineering expertise to develop digital products and services that help both Uniper and its customers to move closer to net-zero emissions.
In this year of working together we have been successful in: • Implementing digital processes that are independent from the technology type of the asset • Launching a change program that encourages people to come out of their comfort zones (digital non-natives learning and adapting to digital ways of working) • Introducing DevOps – pairing both excellence in operations and excellence in software development to deliver top-notch digital applications that withstand technology development and the changes in the Uniper asset portfolio that the energy evolution will bring • Implementing the data strategy for the COO area enabling free flow of data (data democratization across the entire Company) • Providing full transparency on all digital activities across our entire portfolio, fostering a culture of sharing and learning • Developing an infrastructure (platform and connectivity of remote sites) where we can link systems and provide data to create “one touch” automated workflow for our business processes • Delivering on our ambitious business plan.

Digitalization partners Uniper strives to work with sustainable IT partners. Microsoft’s commitment to decarbonization is an important reason why we chose them as a partner for Azure and Microsoft 365 Services. Azure seeks to minimize its environmental impact on communities in four key areas: carbon emissions, water quality, waste, and ecosystems. In addition, Microsoft Azure’s emissions impact dashboard enables us to visualize our Azure-related energy usage. We then look for opportunities to reduce it.
Enerlytics Uniper has helped numerous power generators improve efficiency and maximize returns. Launched in 2018, the Enerlytics platform enhances all aspects of power generation. Enerlytics’ data-driven real-time condition monitoring optimizes power plants’ performance, improves maintenance, and minimizes risk. Enerlytics is deployed at 15 Uniper power plants and at six plants operated by other companies.

As described throughout this report, Uniper is steadily decarbonizing its business. We also help our customers decarbonize theirs by providing them with a reliable supply of increasingly clean energy. And by helping them toward their own decarbonization targets.
Uniper ranks among the largest energy producers and traders in Germany and Europe. Our customer portfolio currently consists of around 1,000 customers from the automotive, paper, chemical, energy, steel, and pharmaceutical industries as well as energy partners such as municipal utilities. We have around 550 industrial customers.
Customer products and services Uniper customers want and need to make their energy portfolios and operations more sustainable. Uniper can make a meaningful contribution to any stage of a company’s decarbonization journey and design an individually tailored approach that covers its entire value chain. Our portfolio includes numerous decarbonization products and services for Energy efficiency, for energy procurement, generation, and storage, and for financing and regulation. Decarbonization is challenging. We therefore develop and implement decarbonization strategies in close partnership with our customers. In addition, we have implemented a Net Zero Solutions Team. This team is focused on the decarbonization of our customers. If customers wish, we can design a road map to guide them all the way to carbon neutrality.
The demand for certified green power products continues to grow. Our 3.6 GW of hydro capacity give us an abundant source of clean energy to meet this demand. Examples include Aqua Power (a TÜV-certified hydro product sold to municipal utilities near our hydro plants in Germany) and Nordic Guarantees of Origin (backed by our hydro fleet in Sweden). We also increasingly market climate- neutral natural gas, biomethane, carbon credits, and hydrogen.
Uniper offers digital solutions as well. The Uniper Digital Portal enables our customers to manage portfolio, procurement, and regulatory issues more efficiently. It also helps them track progress toward their sustainability targets.
Marketing communications. 
GRI 103-1/2/3, 417-1 Uniper aims for its marketing and communications to present its products and services accurately and truthfully. It follows Company guidelines for responsible marketing communications and makes no misleading statements. Our statements about environmental issues comply with regulations for environmental marketing. Uniper strives for its communications, like all its other activities, to meet high ethical standards.
Uniper’s communications include social media. We use them to provide insights into current topics and reports on products and services. We also invite customers and interested parties to get in touch, comment on our postings, and rate them. Transparent exchange and ongoing dialog with stakeholders are important to Uniper.
Customers receive support from Uniper key account managers, who can be contacted at any time for professional and individual advice. Periodic surveys also give customers the opportunity to express their expectations, interests, and concerns. We value this feedback which we also use to refine our products and services. In 2021, for example, our customers helped us to fine-tune the Uniper Digital energy portal so that it meets their needs even better.
The second year of the Covid-19 pandemic again posed challenges to companies and organizations of all kinds. Uniper is also committed to protecting its customers’ health. In 2021 we therefore continued to interact with them predominantly online. This enabled us to remain in touch, provide information and advice, and maintain close ties with customers even amid the pandemic.
Customer data protection. 
GRI 404-2 The Sales team is an integral part of Uniper’s data protection management system, which is set up in line with Uniper’s Functional Policy for Data Protection. This system encompasses training, internal controls, regular audits, incident response plans as well as escalation procedures. All customer-facing staff received an eLearning module on data protection requirements and the GDPR in 2021. Relevant information regarding GDPR, including templates, is disseminated via the Company intranet and, if necessary, presented and discussed in team meetings. All marketing projects and initiatives receive prior clearance from the Legal, Compliance, and Data Protection teams before moving forward. Changes are communicated together with the relevant products and customer solutions directly to our customers.

Uniper uses the operational-control approach. This means that Uniper counts 100% of the direct emissions of any generation assets over which it has operational control. With the exception of Russia, all data was calculated using the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme rules. Rounding may result in minor deviations from the totals.
1 2020 emissions for Teplarna Tabor in the Czech Republic, which was divested in April 2020, refl ect estimates based on actual 2019 data.
2 Emissions from the United Arab Emirates disclosed for the fi rst time in 2021. Uniper’s business in UAE is Uniper Energy DMCC. Uniper Energy DMCC owns and operates a low sulphur marine fuel oils production facility in Fujairah, supplying products from its storage facilities to local partners and large shipping companies. The direct carbon emissions result from the burning of Diesel and Naphtha for electricity generation in the production facility.
3 Uniper's intensity is defi ned as the ratio between direct fossil fuel derived CO2 emissions from electricity and heat generation from Uniper's fully consolidated stationary facilities (fi nancial control approach) and Uniper's generation volume. This indicator does not include facilities that produce only heat and/or steam.
